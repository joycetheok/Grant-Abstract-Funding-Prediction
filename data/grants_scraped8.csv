Offrir plus de possibilités de dépistage permettrait de diminuer les barrières dans l'accès aux services. Les intervenants communautaires qui administrent la trousse de dépistage rapide (TDR) du VIH représentent une initiative prometteuse pour y contribuer. Ce projet de recherche communautaire d'une durée de 3 ans vise à évaluer la mise en œuvre d'une intervention de dépistage rapide du VIH offerte par des pairs intervenants communautaires auprès des GBHRSH à Montréal. L'intervention de dépistage prévoit : l'utilisation de la TDR du VIH administré par un pair intervenant communautaire formé, offert en dépistage de proximité et en site fixe, accompagné d'un counseling pré et post-test incluant le référencement vers d'autres services de santé. Afin de mettre en place le service, des entretiens avec des informateurs-clés seront nécessaires afin d'élaborer une intervention qui respectera les meilleures pratiques en dépistage du VIH. Plusieurs collectes de données seront déployées : des questionnaires pour les usagers serviront à les décrire et évaluer leur satisfaction, des journaux de bord, un questionnaire et des entretiens individuels pour les intervenants permettront d'évaluer comment l'intervention s'est déroulée et les facteurs qui ont influencé son implantation et de mesurer comment la participation au projet permettra le renforcement des capacités des communautés. Le suivi du nombre de tests et leurs résultats permettra de mesurer l'effet sur l'incidence du VIH, l'analyse du registre de rendez-vous permettra d'évaluer les références effectuées vers d'autres services. Ce projet fournira de nouvelles données concernant l'utilisation de la TDR, permettra une prise de décision éclairée quant à l'adoption (ou non) de cette approche et améliora l'offre de dépistage afin d'atteindre les objectifs 90-90-90 de l'ONUSIDA."
Engaging Patients and Caregivers in Research for Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD),"['Otley, Anthony R']","['Grant, Amy K', 'Griffiths, Anne Marie', 'Laupacis, Andreas']","['Patient Engagement', 'Research Priority Setting']",15000.0,323874,"Patient input into the research process is increasingly valued within the healthcare system. Patients and families can make significant contributions to research as active participants; given the opportunity, they can contribute to all stages of the research process, from study design, trial participation, to dissemination of findings. The current proposal will use this framework, by forming an equal partnership with patients. 

Using an established research process developed by the James Lind Alliance (JLA) in the United Kingdom, we will seek to identify unanswered questions related to the treatment and management of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). This work will be conducted through the support of the Canadian Children IBD Network: A Joint partnership of CIHR and the CH.I.L.D. Foundation, consisting of 12 pediatric IBD clinics in children's hospitals across Canada. To begin this patient-researcher partnership, we will form a steering committee, which will bring together patients, families, researchers, physicians, allied health professionals, and representatives from relevant national organizations to identify unanswered research questions about pediatric IBD, and prioritize these uncertainties based on questions ranked as most important. 

The individuals and organizations involved will be crucial in publicizing this study within their social networks, and distributing knowledge translation (KT) materials. KT materials will be created to educate patients and families on identified knowledge gaps (questions that already have an answer in the scientific literature). The results of this study, which will identify the top 10 research priorities (true research uncertainties) will be distributed more widely.

As an initial step in meaningful patient engagement in research, establishing research priorities will set the stage for the larger goal of creating a sustainable patient engagement agenda across our Canadian Children IBD Network."
Simon Otto - Application to the CIHR - Institute of Population and Public Health (IPPH) - Starting Investigators Workshop Travel Bursaries,"['Otto, Simon J']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,400372,"The IPPH is offering travel awards to Starting Investigators who wish to attend a 3-day workshop hosted by IPPH. The workshop is being held in Ottawa from June 9-11, 2019. The objectives of the workshop are to provide participants an opportunity to:

1. Network with peers, government and senior researchers;
2. Learn about the peer review process;
3. Gain familiarity with CIHR and CIHR funding mechanisms.

I have applied to the CIHR project competition multiple times without success. My research area is the One Health epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). I am working on collaborative projects with the Public Health Agency of Canada - Canadian Integrated Program for AMR Surveillance (CIPARS) to develop an Integrated Assessment Model for AMR. This model estimates the transmission of AMR to humans from animals through the food chain. Given this combination of animal and human work, my research topics often sit on a fence between different tri-agency competitions. This workshop will be tremendously helpful for me to learn about the different CIHR funding opportunities for One Health AMR research. I will learn how to craft the human-focused aspects of my research to make them more appealing and have a higher chance of success at receiving CIHR funding. The networking component of the workshop will provide the opportunity for me to discuss my research ideas with senior colleagues who can provide guidance in the CIHR environment."

Cependant, il est nécessaire d'outiller des ministères et leurs collaborateurs en connaissances et stratégies pour qu'ils puissent mieux prendre en compte les populations vulnérables et les enjeux relatifs aux ISS dans leurs actions. Pour ce faire, l'institut national de santé publique du Québec (INSPQ) a reçu la mission de développer des formations et accompagnements relatifs aux ISS, au profit de gestionnaires et de professionnels du réseau de santé publique ainsi que 4 ministères (affaires municipales ; transport ; famille ; agriculture, pêche et alimentation) et leurs collaborateurs. L'objectif du projet postdoctoral est d'évaluer cette intervention. L'évaluation consiste à i) déterminer la pertinence des besoins de soutien identifiés avant le développement de l'intervention au regard des besoins réels des professionnels et gestionnaires, ii) décrire ce qui se passe lors de l'implantation de l'intervention et ii) analyser l'influence des services et activités offerts dans le cadre de l'intervention sur les connaissances et aptitudes des gestionnaires et professionnels des ministères et leurs collaborateurs. L'évaluation se fera avec la collaboration des personnes en charge de développer l'intervention et celles qui vont en bénéficier de manière à ce que les services et activités qui seront développés répondent aux besoins réels des bénéficiaires et contribuent efficacement à réduire les ISS. L'évaluation fournira à l'INSPQ mais aussi au MSSS des connaissances objectives d'une première expérience au Québec et au Canada liée au développement d'une action entre plusieurs ministères en matière de réduction des ISS."
Intercultural challenges to create trust and share mutual respect among non-Indigenous researchers and Indigenous communities,"['Ouellet, Caroline']",['N/A'],"['Application Des Connaissances', 'Cercle De Partage', 'Confiance Et Respect Mutuel', 'Consensus', 'Consentement', 'Consultation', 'Défis Interculturels', 'Premières Nations', 'Recherche Qualitative', 'Two-Eyed Seeing']",2500.0,311241,"Indigenous populations in Canada and abroad often suffer from a higher burden of disease than corresponding non-Indigenous ones. The causes are complex and include several inequities, notably related to social determinants of health. To mitigate such health iniquities and to promote wellness, access to quality primary care, both geographically and culturally, becomes an essential factor. Yet, even when services are available locally, there often exists a cultural disconnect between Indigenous ways of healing and contemporary health care. In a project seeking to elaborate a model to promote access to and recognition of traditional medicines, Indigenous people expressed some important requests. One example is the consult, consent, consensus ethical process that can be linked with qualitative transparency. Another is to adopt a community-based participatory research approach where Indigenous individuals act as co-researchers. Researchers coming from a different background than Indigenous communities indeed represents a challenge. In our project, non-Indigenous researchers will thus stay with a family to learn community lifestyle and values. Thereafter, the non-Indigenous researcher will be invited to collect data with Indigenous co-researchers. Every request made by communities was intended to build trust and respect among all stakeholders. Every step of the project will be designed and created according to the needs and desires of the community but also in a way to enable the generated knowledge to all partners. This will achieve cultural competency for non-Indigenous researchers and build research capacity for Indigenous researchers. Intercultural challenges will remain a major issue but researcher awareness can mitigate this."
"Étude du lien entre les stratégies d'ajustement au stress utilisées lors du coming out et le stress chez les gais, les lesbiennes et les bisexuels","['Ouellet, Émilie']",['N/A'],"['Ajustement Au Stress', 'Coming Out', 'Cortisol Basal', 'Cortisol Réactif', 'Homosexualité/Bisexualité', 'Marqueur Biologique', 'Questionnaire', 'Santé', ""Stratégies D'Ajustement Au Stress"", 'Stress']",17500.0,226704,"Les gais, les lesbiennes et les bisexuels (GLBs) rapportent vivre plus de stress que les hétérosexuels. Cette observation est souvent attribuée au fait que ceux-ci sont exposés à plusieurs stresseurs: coming out, rejet des parents et amis, discrimination, harcèlement, agressions physiques, conflits avec son orientation sexuelle, etc.  Or, il est connu que le stress est associé à de nombreux problèmes de santé, autant psychologique que physique. D'ailleurs, il est connu que les GLBs présentent  plus de problèmes de santé que les hétérosexuels. La relation entre l'orientation sexuelle et le stress pourrait toutefois être modulée par certaines variables, entre autres par les stratégies d'ajustement au stress utilisées lors du coming out. En effet, dans certaines situations stressantes, le fait d'éviter un problème serait souvent une mauvaise stratégie d'ajustement au stress, tandis que le fait de chercher du soutient social serait une bonne stratégie. La présente étude a pour but d'évaluer si les stratégies que les GLBs utilisent lors de leur coming out est lié à leur stress à long terme. Si tel est le cas, il sera possible de former des intervants spécialisés pour sensibiliser les jeunes aux stratégies d'ajustement à adopter si jamais ils prennent conscience plus tard (ou s'ils sont conscients) d'avoir une orientation sexuelle homosexuelle ou bisexuelle. Ainsi, lors de leur coming out, les GLBs seraient mieux outillés pour faire face au stress. Il est connu que le coming out est extrêmement stressant et peut même mener à des pensées suicidaires. De tels programmes seraient donc extrêmement utiles. Également, avoir appris à utiliser les bonnes stratégies face au stress lié à son orientation sexuelle pourrait aider les GLBs à mieux faire face au stress tout au long de leur vie, et ainsi prévenir chez eux plusieurs problèmes de santé mentale et physique. De tels programmes de sensibilisation pourraient par exemple être implantés dans les écoles secondaires."

Plusieurs études ont montré que 50% des patients asthmatiques ne prennent pas leurs médicaments pour l'asthme tels que prescrits, ce qui demeure toutefois peu expliqué. L'adhérence à la médication est un important facteur comportemental pouvant être influencé par des facteurs psychosociaux, comme le statut socioéconomique, le soutien social, les croyances concernant la santé et la santé mentale. Cette étude sera la première à déterminer si des facteurs psychosociaux spécifiques sont des facteurs de risques indépendants d'une faible adhérence à la médication, d'un faible contrôle de l'asthme, et d'une plus grande utilisation des services de santé dû à l'asthme. Les résultats pourraient être utilisés pour (1) renseigner les physiciens quant à l'importance de considérer les facteurs de risques psychosociaux des maladies chroniques et (2) fournir des informations pour le développement et l'implantation d'interventions s'adressant aux disparités sociales et visant à améliorer l'auto-efficacité et la dépression dans le but d'améliorer le contrôle de l'asthme chez les patients à risque.

One explanation might be that we know very little about the processes whereby early adversity gets ""under the skull, skin and cells"" to instigate long-term risk towards mental health (e.g. depression, conduct disorder, substance use disorders). Animal research has taught us that early adversity jeopardizes brain development and disrupts our biological systems designed to help us cope with stress. These changes are believed to affect long-term vulnerabilities to mental health. Our objective is to further understand how early adversity influences adolescents' biological functioning and how these relate to mental health in humans. Participants will come from the Québec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD), a large sample of adolescents born in 1997-1998 and followed between the ages of 5 months and 12 years. We propose to test two key questions: (1) Does early adversity alter our biological systems supporting adaptation to stress, as measured by stress hormones and markers that affect the expression of our genes? (2) Do disruptions in these biological markers explain the impact of early adversity on mental health problems in adolescence? This project is well positioned to make a strong return on financial investment and in terms of discoveries that can be implemented into more effective strategies for children facing adversity to help them reverse their susceptibilities by fostering their potential."

This is especially true for children who manifest disruptive behaviours or live in low-income neighbourhoods. Sources of stress include fights for a toy with a sibling or peers, exclusion from games at daycare, and harsh discipline from parents. Repeated and prolonged stress may result in unusually high levels of the ""stress hormone"" cortisol. Chronically elevated cortisol can have damaging effects on the developing brain, affecting later health and social functioning. It is therefore in the public interest to reduce chronic stress in preschoolers while they are learning social skills essential to have harmonious relationships with others later in life. Our project proposes to test whether two interventions can reduce chronic stress in preschoolers and which one is the best. One is the training of daycare educators for a program that uses a puppet to promote social skills and positive relationships between children at daycare. The other is group training for parents promoting positive parenting practices. Each intervention will be provided over a period of one year and 3 months. We will measure cortisol levels in hair before and twice after the interventions. Our study is paired with the already funded I-CARE trial that will be conducted to reduce behaviour problems in 80 daycares in low-income neighbourhoods in the Montreal and Sherbrooke regions (1280 2-4 year-olds). From our pilot study, we expect that the interventions will reduce chronic stress and improve social behaviour. Results will advance knowledge on child development and how prevention programs work. Our findings will also document which intervention works best and for whom, which could help allocating more effectively our limited resources."
The Burden of Harsh Parenting on Socioemotional and Behavioral Problems: the Role of Chronic Cortisol secretion in the Preschool Years.,"['Ouellet-Morin, Isabelle']","['Boivin, Michel', 'Côté, Sylvana', 'Larose, Marie-Pier', 'Lupien, Sonia J', 'Matte-Gagné, Célia', 'Muckle, Gina', 'Petitclerc, Amélie M', 'Tarabulsy, George']","['Child (Reciprocal) Effects', 'Chronic Stress', 'Cortisol', 'Early Childhood', 'Early-Life Stress', 'Harsh And Coercive Parenting', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Mediation And Moderation Models', 'Socioemotional And Behavioral Problems', 'Transactional Models']",481952.0,469186,"""Terrible twos"" is a well-known idiom and for good reasons; children start exploring their environment, occasionally in a perilous manner, have tantrums and anger outbursts when frustrated. In response, parents use coercion and harsh behaviors in varying extent to shape their children's capacity to regulate their emotions and inhibit unwanted behaviors. Harsh parenting peaks during the preschool years. However, the more these parental practices are used, higher socioemotional-behavioral problems tend to be. This association may be explained, in part, through disruptions in the secretion of the ""stress hormone"" cortisol, which can have damaging effects on the developing brain. Some children may also be more affected by harsh parenting, depending on individual and family factors, including their own cortisol secretion. Yet, existing evidence supporting these hypotheses remains elusive in humans. Our project aims to clarify the associations during the preschool years, and to robustly test for whom (sex, parental perceived' gender, temperament) and under which circumstances (family support, parental stress) harsh parenting is more likely to affect socioemotional-behavioral problems. We seek funding to measure cortisol levels in hair when the children participating to the Growing Up in Québec Study, a population-based sample of 4,000 children born in Québec in 2020-2121, will be 1½, 2½, and 3½ years, and for whom home visits and other measures have been funded by the Government of Quebec and its partners. Results will 1) advance knowledge on how harsh parenting affects children's socioemotional-behavioral problems; 2) inform prevention research on whether we should target stress biological pathways to mitigate the impact of harsh parenting on children; and 3) determine for whom and in which family contexts these associations are exacerbated (of buffered) to allocate more effectively our limited resources."

Investigating the Association between Interpregnancy Interval and Autism Spectrum Disorders using the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy's Data Repository,"['Ouellette-Kuntz, Hélène', 'Brownell, Marni D', 'Flavin, Michael P', 'Lam, Yuk-Miu']","['Roos, Leslie L', 'Smith, Graeme N']","['Autism', 'Etiology', 'Interpregnancy Interval', 'Manitoba Centre For Health Policy', 'Secondary Analysis']",70376.0,231359,"Autism spectrum disorder (""autism"") describes lifelong neurodevelopmental conditions that cause varying and often significant degrees of impairment in social interaction and communication. A large proportion of individuals on the autism spectrum also have intellectual disability. It is currently estimated that autism affects 1 in 110 children. Its impact extends beyond the individual and family: as the Government of Canada notes, ""ASD [Autism] is not just a health issue, but also has overarching implications for Canadian society as a whole.""  

The causes of autism are unknown. Genetic factors are believed to play a large role, and environmental factors are also thought to contribute. A recent study from California found that shorter intervals between the birth of one child and conception of the next child (the interpregnancy interval) increase the risk of autism. If this finding is confirmed, it would be one of the first known risk factors for autism that can be modified. Accordingly, we propose to investigate the relationship between the interpregnancy interval and autism using existing data housed at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy. Our sample will consist of pairs of first and second children born in Manitoba between 1988 and 2005 to the same mother. These children will be followed up for at least six years to search for a code indicating autism in health, education and social services data. We will then look back at birth records to calculate interpregnancy intervals and determine whether they differ between children who are diagnosed with autism and those who are not. 

Confirming that shorter interpregnancy intervals increase the risk of autism would represent a major breakthrough in maternal and child population health. Public health messaging aimed at recent mothers would have the potential to enhance reproductive outcomes and reduce childhood disability."
Influence of alcohol and peer passengers on risky driving behavior in young adults,"['Ouimet, Marie Claude']","['Brown, Thomas G', 'Bukowski, William M', 'Roy, Elise', 'Simons-Morton, Bruce G']","['Alcohol', 'Driving Simulation', 'Injury Prevention', 'Motor Vehicle Crashes', 'Peer Passengers', 'Young Drivers']",209612.0,210137,"The World Health Organization has identified traffic crashes as the main cause of morbidity and mortality for teenagers and young adults. Among the many risk factors that contribute to their crash involvement, two are critical: peer passenger presence, which is unique to young drivers, and the influence of alcohol, a universal risk for drivers but one against which young drivers are most susceptible. While current countermeasures do reduce some driving risks, the ongoing carnage among young people demonstrates that more effective intervention is required. As a first step to achieve this goal, clarification of how passenger presence interacts with alcohol consumption to increase risk is needed. Unfortunately, the breadth of knowledge in this area is severely limited. Using driving simulation and a random assignment experimental design with a sample of 18-19 year old male and female drivers, we directly observe the impact of experimentally manipulated passenger characteristics and alcohol quantity on risky driving. Via further exploratory analyses, we investigate the contribution of individual high-risk characteristics (e.g., high sensation seeking, low resistance to peer pressure) to the alcohol-passenger risk interaction. Pragmatically, this study will inform refinement of current programs (e.g., parent-focused prevention programs and brief motivational interventions), as well as the development of other more novel approaches (e.g., in-vehicle technology) to reduce risk. The results will also guide evidence-informed policy-making by clarifying the impact of passenger limits in the context of a common condition in young drivers - the consumption of alcohol. Overall, the ultimate objective of this study is to reduce risky driving in young drivers, thereby increasing traffic safety for all."
Towards monitoring of driving while impaired by cannabis and/or other drugs,"['Ouimet, Marie Claude']","['Brown, Thomas G', 'Dufour, Magali', 'Goyette, Mathieu', 'Mann, Robert E', 'Nazif-Munoz, Jose I', 'Roy, Elise', 'Rueda, Sergio', 'Vasiliadis, Helen-Maria', 'Vingilis, Evelyn R']","['Arrests And Convictions', 'Cannabis', 'Costs', 'Crashes', 'Driving While Impaired', 'Feasibility', 'Monitoring', 'Other Drugs', 'Outcome And Process Variables', 'Traffic Safety']",100000.0,372887,"The Canadian government is committed to the legalization of recreational use of cannabis, making Canada only the second country in the world to do so after Uruguay. While the legal and public health implications of legalization are complex, a major concern among Canadians revolves around impaired driving by cannabis, and appropriately so. Injuries and fatalities due to traffic crashes represent an enormous burden on global health, with impaired driving by alcohol and other drugs an established factor associated with morbidity and estimated to be implicated in a third of all fatal traffic crashes. To achieve a good understanding of the situation, we will need to monitor negative consequences associated with impaired driving by cannabis such as crashes, arrests, and convictions as well as other variables that might help explain changes in these consequences (e.g., successful prosecution). Some of the consequences and explanatory data are already contained in established data platforms that are analysis ready. However, there is likely a trove of relevant information that is not included in current databases, such as that documented in written reports. Additionally, relevant information may be lost due to incomplete documentation procedures. This Canadian Institutes of Health Research catalyst project aims at understanding how consequences and explanatory variables will evolve with legalization of cannabis by informing the development of a monitoring strategy for impaired driving by cannabis. The ultimate long-term goal would be the development of a platform that provides stakeholders, policy makers, decision makers, and knowledge users the information (e.g., via annual reports) to better understand the impact of legalization and deterrence and preventative strategies in the general population but also as a function of individual driver characteristics, such as age, sex, and geographic location."

Les causes exactes de la maladie d'Alzheimer ne sont pas élucidées de façon claire à ce jour. cependant, des facteurs génétiques et environnementaux comme certaines anomalies génétiques, des facteurs de risque cardio-vasculaires (hypertension, l'hypercholestérolémie, l'obésité, le diabète)ou encore l'intoxication à certains métaux lourds, contribuant à son apparition et à son développement, sont connus. De nombreuses recherches à travers  le monde tentent de créer des outils permettant de diagnostiquer la maladie à un stade plus précoce. Mieux connaître la maladie d'Alzheimer permettait de la prévenir ou de la contrôler ? Telle est le sujet qui sera débattu au cours de ce café pour sensibiliser le grand public et de répondre aux questions qu'il se pose sur la maladie d'Alzheimer.

Le diabète est une maladie chronique qui se manifeste lorsque le corps est incapable de produire suffisamment de l'insuline ou de l'utiliser correctement pour contrôler le taux de sucres dans le sang. Lorsque le taux de sucre dans le sang atteint ou dépasse 2 g/L, le diabète est avéré. C'est une maladie grave dont les complications sont difficiles à gérer et les conséquences peuvent conduire à un décès prématuré, à l'invalidité ou à d'autres maladies, qui touche de plus en plus de personnes dans le monde entier. Toutefois, les personnes atteintes du diabète peuvent prendre des mesures pour contrôler et réduire les risques de complications. Les experts qui animeront ce café scientifique décriront les différents types de diabète, exposeront ses complications et ses conséquences, et insisteront  sur les mesures de prévention et de contrôle du diabète."

Although genetic factors play an important role in the occurrence of these disorders, it is now recognized that these disorders are multifactorial, involving genetic, social, and environmental causes. Exposure to air pollution is suspected to cause neuro-inflammation and oxidative stress. Air pollution is a complex mixture that includes particulate matter, gazes, nitrogen dioxides, and metals. The objective of our study is to investigate how a ubiquitous environmental factor, such as air pollution, may be associated with children's neurodevelopment. We will also examine whether children experimenting maternal psychosocial stress, and children who are genetically predisposed could be more vulnerable to the exposure to air pollution, and thus exhibit more symptoms of neurodevelopmental disorders at the same levels of exposure. To examine these hypotheses, we will measure concentrations of particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide, in addition to the proximity to major roads during pregnancy, and we will link these measures to neurodevelopmental test scores using adequate statistical methods, and taking into account other important factors that affect the child's neurodevelopment. Neurodevelopmental disabilities are a problem for affected children and their parents with profound impacts on the quality of life, academic achievement, and child's behavior, in addition to the global impact on the welfare and productivity of the entire society. This study intends to inform public health policies to improve neurodevelopmental trajectories in susceptible populations."

The neurosciences and genetics are of particular interest to the public as they may provide scientific answers to questions concerning health and illness, as well addressing concerns about addictions, particularly to drugs and alcohol, but also to certain types of behaviours. For example, USA Today recently reported in a headline that ""Brain scans show how meditation calms pain"" and The Vancouver Sun recently reported that ""Gambling addiction runs in family"" referring to how an Australian study has found that ""genetic factors play major role in disorder."" The Café seeks to explore whether members of the public, academics, and journalists themselves perceive the media presentation of neuroscience specifically, and health science generally, to be accurate, or whether such reports tell stories rather than report the facts. The Café will provide a forum to discuss whether such reporting provides a positive function in making science interesting to the public or is the product of potentially hidden issues, such as the lack of basic scientific training among journalists, the reduction in newspaper budgets for science reporting, or changes to how the public accesses the media through the internet. We also ask whether the media's reporting of medical issues might be the product of media and/or public fatigue whereby stories have a short shelf life which makes them unsuitable for presenting as newsworthy. Ultimately we ask whether media stories help or hinder attempts by medical scientists to explain their work to the public, and, in turn whether this impacts upon our everyday understanding of mental health and illness."

While oral medications such as methadone work well, some individuals discontinue treatment and continue injecting street opioids, leaving them at high risk of HIV, hepatitis C and overdose death. Our studies funded by CIHR (NAOMI, SALOME, RUTH) demonstrated that prescribed injectable opioids, i.e. diacetylmorphine, the active ingredient in heroin, and hydromorphone, also known as Dilaudid™, are effective at attracting and retaining such individuals in treatment. Given the present opioid overdose crisis, public health officials are calling for increased access to injectable opioid treatments across Canada. As a result, treatment with injectable opioids will be expanding for the first time in Canada beyond clinical trial participants, to reach individuals who continue to inject illicit street opioids and remain at grave risk of fatal overdose. The PORTIA Study (Program of Outcomes Research on Treatment with Injectables for Addiction) will investigate the expansion of this treatment to new patients who have never received injectable treatment before. As this treatment is expanded to more diverse patients, it is important to explore how patients' with different characteristics (e.g. gender, other drug use, etc.) respond to treatment. Both patient and provider factors will be investigated to help in the design of expanded services that are scalable, feasible, affordable and effective. Our group is the only team in the world to have studied addiction treatment with injectable hydromorphone, and the only one in Canada to have investigated medically prescribed heroin. This study represents a singular opportunity to gather evidence to inform the creation of the most effective programs possible. Expanded access offers the hope of addressing patients' health and social needs and protecting them from the grave risk of overdose."

Getting more people access to life saving treatments in more ways is urgently needed. For people with opioid use disorder (OUD), several medications can support their opioid needs. One form of medication assisted treatment is injectable opioid agonist treatment (iOAT), wherein clients are prescribed injectable opioids (e.g., pharmaceutical grade heroin) in safe, individualized doses. iOAT has proven to reach and treat clients who the system is otherwise unable to engage in care. Indeed, in 2020, the Canadian Minister of Health wrote to all provincial Ministers of Health and health profession regulators asking them to do all they can to support ""programs that provide greater access to a safer, pharmaceutical-grade alternative to the toxic street supply"". Despite this, iOAT has only expanded to a limited degree in Canada for reasons such as tight provision restrictions that make participation difficult. For example, medications are not allowed to leave the site. Providers expressed these restrictions do not align with a person-centered care approach and perpetuate stigma.

Given that iOAT currently has accessibility barriers that do not align with the principles of disability justice (e.g., clients have to come to the clinic multiple times every day), this project will expand our research to support accessible and equitable iOAT. Using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies, we will interview most of the clients receiving iOAT in BC on how disability and accessibility intersect with iOAT, including how they see iOAT evolving to meet their ever-changing accessibility needs. As providers have previously shared that the current system-level iOAT guidelines prevent them from providing person-centered care, we will also interview providers across Canada on tangible, specific steps they believe should be taken to improve treatment delivery, accessibility, and equity."

It will do so by: (1) tracking the rapidly changing health and public policy landscape in Canada (2) using critical feminist and race theories to analyze,compare and contrast COVID-19 and HIV containment and mitigation strategies; and (3) examining how these policies address, reify, challenge, and uphold existing health inequities from the perspective of Black  people living with and at risk of Pandemics in Canada.Using institutional ethnography as my main qualitative method of inquiry,I will analyze the quotidian experiences of Black Canadians and examine the organization of social and institutional systems and policies during pandemics. My personal experiences as a Black woman living with HIV and deep roots in the HIV and Black communities are especially critical for successfully implementation of this ambitious plan.An integrated knowledge translation and exchange plan using multiple forms of dissemination (e.g., scientific papers, policy papers, community forums, and social media) and collaboration with Black organizations, community members, researchers, activists, and scholars will ensure that findings are accessible to diverse audiences."

Cases have increased in recent decades.  The reasons for the increase are complex, however often overlooked socially based factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption have played a role. The implementation of interventions designed to address these determinants could be a cost effective approach to TB control and may have a greater impact than the technical approaches currently advocated by the World Health Organization.   

Objective: To predict, in 3 low and middle income countries, the epidemiologic impact and cost effectiveness of a technical approach to TB control (using improved diagnostic tests for earlier diagnosis of active TB disease) versus a non-technical population level intervention designed to reduce tobacco use and alcohol consumption. Outcomes estimated include: TB infections, cases and deaths under each strategy as well as cost per death averted and per QALY gained.

Methods:  Dynamic computer simulation models (Susceptible- Latent-Infectious-Recovered models) will be used to predict the behavior of the TB epidemic with each intervention.  India, Russia and Zambia will be modeled as they represent a range of alcohol and smoking use, as well as HIV and TB epidemiology. HIV and drug resistance will be incorporated into models.  Pathogenetic parameters, as well as estimates of the impact of risk factors and interventions, will be obtained from literature reviews, publicly available databases and expert panels. Extensive sensitivity analyses will be conducted.

Implications: New approaches to TB control are desperately needed.  This study should generate new information regarding the epidemiologic impact of undiagnosed cases and the potential merits of non-technical preventative approaches, focusing on social determinants, for disease control.  Policy makers rely on such information to make informed decisions and improve the health of the populations."

Although some evidence indicates that the social environment might play an important role in the risk for suicide, research that uses stronger study designs, such as the cohort study, i.e. people are followed over time, are needed to provide more convincing evidence that social characteristics potentially influence suicide.  Two examples of the social environment that have been shown to be related to suicide include income inequality (the gap between rich and poor) and social fragmentation (population turnover within a residential area). Data from the Registered Persons' Database (RPDB), which contains information about anyone who has ever received an Ontario health card since 1990, will be linked to Canada Census data. Area-level socio-economic variables will be derived from the census data.  The RPDB contains information on sex, date of birth, and date of death.  The cause of death was determined when linked with vital statistics. A range of statistical models will then be applied to analyze linked data on individuals' socio-demographic attributes and completed suicide risk, suicide attempts, and suicidal ideation. To gain further knowledge, a subset of the RPDB will be linked with multiple waves of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS).  By doing so, I will be able to control for household income, and determine the role of social support and depression within the relationship between income inequality and social fragmentation and suicide risk.  This project will advance knowledge on the role of the social environment on suicide and inform social policies and public health interventions aimed at ameliorating mental health status of Ontarians.

Little is known about the sociocultural processes through which the complex milieu of individual and neighbourhood factors either supports or weakens health. The proposed project aims to conduct analyses to disentangle the role of economic deprivation, familial and cultural factors, and ethnicity on blood pressure. The role of overweight and obesity will also be investigated.  The Boston Area Community Survey is a cohort study with a randomly sampled population of 6,000 ethnically diverse men and women from economically diverse neighbourhoods will be used to gain a better understanding of the relationship between income and blood pressure. The Framingham Heart Study is a multigenerational study that follows individuals, their children and grandchildren. Analyses will involve looking at social inequalities, such as poverty and neighbourhood economic deprivation, familial characteristics, and cultural attributes and how they influence change in blood pressure across time and generations. This project will provide much needed information on patterns and trends in the likelihood of experiencing high blood pressure over time and the significance of the individual, the family, and the community. Results can also help to guide health practitioners and policy makers to develop and implement public health policies to decrease inequalities in blood pressure."

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the adverse association between social inequities and health outcomes may have worsened. The pandemic and public health measures disproportionately impacted people across socioeconomic status, racial/ethnic, immigrant, and gender groups. In this proposed investigation, we will study the association between income inequality and adolescent health outcomes, such as depression and anxiety, and substance use, such as cannabis use, cigarette smoking, and alcohol use throughout the pandemic. We hypothesize that health disparities observed before the pandemic will widen from 2019-2022.  We will also test whether associations differ across socio-demographic groups. Finally, we will study potential mechanisms involved in which income inequality leads to health outcomes among adolescents."

Evidence identifying the health impacts of cuts to public health spending is limited. Furthermore, understanding how the impact of public health cuts on health inequities is essential for better population health. 

The current climate of austerity in Ontario presents an important opportunity to study the impact of public health divestments on population health. Specifically, we will measure changes to public health financing and delivery by examining Annual Service and Budget Plans for each public health unit. Secondly, we will administer questionnaires and in-person interviews with the Medical Officers of Health to identify how each public health unit prioritizes programs in response to budget cuts. Finally, we will conduct natural experiments analyzing secondary data, such as the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), to determine the impact of budget cuts. 

The overall goal of this study is to establish an open access data system for tracking public health expenditures, governance and delivery over time in Ontario and to examine the relationship between public health financing and population health and health inequities. 

The project will involve working with the frontline public health sector, such as the Medical Officer of Health of Toronto Public Health, and the Ontario Public Health Association, to develop our research questions and methodology, and plan for dissemination of our findings.

Among high income countries, increases in life expectancy have been observed during the 20th and 21st centuries. However, recent trends point to a majority of high income countries experiencing declines in life expectancy, causing concern.

Researchers have attributed these trends to increases in rates of deaths of despair, defined as deaths caused by fatal opioid-related overdoses, suicide, and cirrhosis of the liver due to excessive alcohol consumption. Preliminary research points to increases in societal inequality as a cause for these trends.

This study will identify trends over time of the relationship between social-economic inequality and rates of deaths of despair over time. We will determine if social economic indicators of inequality within residential areas, in particular income inequality and labour force participation rates, are risk factors for deaths of despair risk among Canadians over and above other area and individual level characteristics over time. Also, we will study the mechanisms involved. We will use large administrative population-based datasets that have been linked with the mortality records. With recent declines in life expectancy, there is an urgent need to study the role of social-economic inequality on the risk for deaths of despair.

Specifically, we propose to:
1.  Describe how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted public health funding, and services, and staffing geared towards prevention of suicide, and drug and alcohol poisoning, across local Public Health Units (PHUs) in Ontario.  
2.Estimate the associations between PHU programs, resources, and services and risk for suicide attempts, and drug and alcohol poisoning.

This rise is particularly steep among Indigenous peoples who also face high rates of depression and emotional distress due to the ongoing legacy of colonization resulting in systemic racism and intergenerational trauma. Diabetes care includes many aspects of self-care (checking sugar, taking medication, following exercise and diet advice), which is negatively impacted by emotional distress. The emotional distress specific to living with diabetes, known as diabetes distress (DD), is due to feeling overwhelmed by the demands of self-care, fears of complications, and guilt or shame over lifestyle choices. DD is known to be related to decreased wellbeing and poor diabetes control.  DD has not been studied among Indigenous youth, nor have interventions aimed at reducing it to improve diabetes management.
Peer support has been shown to help empower youth and young adults by normalizing their experiences and providing a safe space to express themselves. In the Eeyou Istchee Cree community in Quebec, Jonathan Linton, an Indigenous young adult with diabetes, developed a program for youth with diabetes on management and self-care for diabetes that incorporates traditional elements. As he helps participants be more active and eat healthier, he supports them in their journey with diabetes and creates a safe space for them to voice their concerns, easing their distress.
This research proposal will build on the initiative developed by Mr. Linton to create a community of peer-mentors to provide Indigenous youth and young adults with the support needed to improve their distress and improve their diabetes control. To evaluate the program, a combination of questionnaires to assess changes in DD and other emotional factors, measures of diabetes outcomes (sugar levels, blood pressure, weight), and Photovoice, a research tool that allows participants to use images to explain their experience with diabetes, will be used."

First, I will identify social, environmental, and clinical risk factors for premature mortality. I will then use these risk factors to create the prediction tool using machine learning. This research will identify which communities are at higher risk, highlighting prevention opportunities for diverse populations. As well, health planners will be able to use this tool to test the impact of health interventions aimed at reducing premature mortality rates. This tool will be capable of predicting the effects of health policies that affect over 21-million people living in urban areas, 60% of the Canadian population. This prediction tool will be the first of its kind and will be built specifically for a Canadian context.  This prediction tool is novel because it will be capable of incorporating information on people's social and physical environments as well as their clinical history and health-related behaviours. Incorporating social and environmental data has two benefits: it helps the model make more accurate predictions and it integrates a broader focus on the determinants of health. Including social and environmental perspectives emphasizes prevention and equity, and it incorporates these perspectives into machine learning applications for population health. Creating this prediction tool requires developing new predictive methods that combine the fields of epidemiology and machine learning.

OHTs require risk segmentation (i.e., grouping the population into high, medium, and low risk) to deliver targeted interventions to improve health outcomes and prevent worsening health conditions, ultimately preventing future health system burdens. Risk prediction allows OHTs to proactively deliver the right interventions at the right time to the right people, maximizing health systems resources. However, OHTs rely on health claims or billing data and lack data on social and environmental determinants of health, limiting upstream prevention and health equity at the population level. We will enhance THP's hospital-based analytics with population health data and artificial intelligence (AI) methods to support THP and the Mississauga OHT's goal of effectively managing population health. We will deploy our PreMPoRT-ML algorithm as a use case for applying AI methods in the health system. PreMPoRT-ML uses machine learning and social and environmental data at the population level to predict the incidence of premature mortality (death before age 75). It can also simulate the effects of system-level interventions to support health system planning. PreMPoRT-ML provides precise risk segmentation, allowing highly targeted interventions to impact health trajectories and maximize health system resources.

Les effets de l'activité physique intuitive sur les habitudes de vie et l'image corporelle chez les jeunes,"['Paiement, Karine']",['N/A'],"['Activité Physique', 'Adolescents', 'Alimentation', 'Application Mobile', 'Habitudes Alimentaires', 'Image Corporelle', 'Intuitive', 'Milieu Scolaire', 'Sommeil', 'Sédentarité']",105000.0,459117,"Plus de 50% des adolescents sont insatisfaits de leur apparence au Québec. L'insatisfaction corporelle peut d'une part être une barrière à l'adoption d'un mode de vie actif, et d'autre part mener à une pratique d'activité physique excessive et non sécuritaire. L'activité physique intuitive est une approche positive qui implique l'écoute des signaux corporels pour déterminer quand et comment bouger. À ce jour, aucune étude ne s'est intéressée au développement de l'intuition dans la pratique d'activité physique chez une population de jeunes canadiens. Les objectifs de cette recherche sont 1) Traduire, adapter et évaluer le Intuitive Exercise Scale (IEXS) pour une population canadienne d'étudiants; 2) Mesurer l'activité physique intuitive et les associations avec les motivations à la pratique d'activité physique, l'image corporelle et l'alimentation intuitive chez les participantes de l'approche Fillactive; 3) Examiner les effets d'une intervention en activité physique intuitive chez une population canadienne d'étudiants sur les habitudes de vie et l'image corporelle. L'approche Fillactive aide les écoles secondaires à offrir des activités physiques aux adolescentes en misant, entre autres, sur une image corporelle positive. Les participants seront recrutés par Fillactive (> 400 adolescentes) et par les réseaux sociaux d'écoles secondaires, cégeps et universités du Québec (>200 garçons et filles de 12-24 ans) et répondront à des questionnaires en ligne. Les réponses obtenues seront analysées afin d'évaluer 1) la validité et la fiabilité du IEXS; 2) les facteurs associés à l'activité physique intuitive; 3) les changements entre le début et la fin de l'intervention. Ce projet permettra d'acquérir des connaissances sur les interventions favorisant une pratique d'activité physique saine en tenant compte de la préoccupation à l'égard du poids et mettra de l'avant l'activité physique intuitive comme approche favorisant une image corporelle positive chez les jeunes canadiens."
Tuberculosis screening of health care workers: do novel blood tests have a role?,"['Pai, Madhukar']","['Behr, Marcel A', 'Dendukuri, Nandini', 'Menzies, Richard', 'Schwartzman, Kevin']","['Diagnosis', 'Epidemiology', 'Health-Care Workers', 'Interferon-G Assay', 'Nosocomial Infection', 'Occupational Health']",336725.0,180032,"Tuberculosis (TB) infects 2 billion people, and 9 million people develop active disease every year. Because these individuals eventually present to health-care providers, health care workers are especially vulnerable to TB exposure and infection. For this reason, health workers are screened with tuberculin skin testing to identify and treat TB infection. However, the tuberculin test, the oldest diagnostic test in medicine, has several limitations in accuracy and reliability. Recently, new blood-based tests for TB infection have been developed, called interferon-gamma (IFN-g) release assays. These blood tests seem to be more accurate than the tuberculin test, and they have several features that make them attractive for screening health care workers. We have enrolled a large number of health workers in Canada and India, and have screened them with both the skin test and the blood test. We propose to follow them up to determine the risk of new infections and determine the utility of interferon-gamma assays. Worldwide, thousands of health workers are screened for TB. The current screening approach is complex, costly, and relies on a century-old imperfect skin test. It is, therefore, important to know if newly available blood tests should replace the tuberculin test. Our project will address key questions that will determine whether to continue to use the tuberculin test, or substitute the skin test with interferon-g assays."
"Validation of rapid, molecular testing for COVID-19 and integration with TB diagnostics","['Pai, Madhukar']","['Dendukuri, Nandini', 'Kohli, Mikashmi', 'MacLean, Emily L', 'Sulis, Giorgia', 'Ugarte, Cesar']","['Covid-19', 'Diagnostics', 'Genexpert', 'Tuberculosis']",,429280,"We are living in a world severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is critical we do not neglect other diseases that persist outside of the global spotlight. Losing progress against the worldwide tuberculosis (TB) epidemic would mean adding to the 1.5 million TB-related deaths reported each year, but it is not inevitable. The symptoms for COVID-19 and TB are similar, with fever and cough both frequently observed. As such, integrating COVID-19 and TB testing is an opportunity to improve the quality of patient care by taking advantage of already-existing infrastructure. One example is GeneXpert, a diagnostic platform proven to be effective in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) for TB diagnosis. The TB test, Xpert MTB/RIF, rapidly detects TB with high accuracy. Recently, a COVID-19 test, Xpress SARS-CoV-2, received FDA emergency use authorization for use on the GeneXpert platform. This is a promising development, particularly for LMICs with extensive GeneXpert networks already in place, but the test's diagnostic accuracy is unknown.
We propose a validation study of Xpress SARS-CoV-2 to evaluate its diagnostic accuracy in Peru, a middle-income country already using GeneXpert. After obtaining an estimate of the test's performance, we will assess the feasibility of integrating testing for COVID-19 and TB on the GeneXpert platform. Namely, we will collect one sputum sample from individuals presenting with clinical symptoms typical to COVID-19 and TB, and test them using Xpress SARS-CoV-2 and Xpert MTB/RIF, respectively. We expect that the amount of COVID-19 and TB detected will be similar to what we would have detected with complete but time-consuming diagnostic work-ups for each disease. Testing for two diseases with common symptoms in one clinical interaction will be convenient for patients and healthcare workers. Having rapidly available diagnostic data will facilitate a more timely response for patient care and, ultimately, population-level planning."

A substantial proportion of TB patients in India initially seek care from private and informal healthcare providers (IPs), especially in rural areas and urban slums. Our prior research in India has shown that IPs have sub-optimal level of TB care knowledge, resulting in delayed referrals and adversely affecting the timely diagnosis and treatment of TB cases. To enhance the quality of care and address this issue, it is essential to provide training to IPs, enabling them to identify presumptive TB cases and equipping them with a simple TB diagnostic tool.

We will invite IPs in urban and rural Patna (India) to participate in this project, and they will be randomly assigned to two groups: the control group or the intervention group. The control group will receive comprehensive training on how to identify patients with symptoms suggestive of TB and how to make appropriate referrals for further evaluation. The intervention group will undergo the same training as the control group but will also receive a specialized training on the collection, handling and storage of tongue swab samples for TB testing. We will measure the impact of the intervention comparing key outcomes between two groups, such as the difference in count of TB cases diagnosed in intervention and control arms, number of presumptive TB cases identified, number of tongue swabs collected, and proportion of successful referrals made by IPs in both arms.

Our findings will provide evidence on whether training IPs will improve TB case diagnosis, and whether enabling them to collect tongue swabs for TB testing can amplify this impact. We will present the study results at international conferences, and aim for publication in high-impact journals. Our results will also be shared with policy bodies to inform private provider engagement strategies."
Exercise induced ischemia is prevalent in women with anxiety and no cardiovascular disease history,"['Paine, Nicola']",['N/A'],['Cardiac Rehabilitation'],1200.0,331755,"Women who suffer a heart problems are more likely to experience worse cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes compared to men. Women could benefit from cardiac rehabilitation (CR) (exercise to improve heart health), but are less likely than men to be referred for and attend CR than men. Exercise testing is used to diagnose CVD and decide if patients should be referred to CR. Psychiatric disorders, such as depression and anxiety, can influence exercise test results, including evidence of reduced blood flow to the heart. But, little is known about sex differences in the presence and effect of psychiatric disorders on exercise testing. Our study examined relationships between psychiatric disorders, sex, and reduced blood flow to the heart during exercise testing. 
A total of 2342 patients were referred for exercise testing (using a standard treadmill test). All patients underwent a psychiatric interview on the day of exercise testing to evaluate psychiatric disorders. Our analyses accounted for factors such as age, history of CVD, exercise performance and medication use.
Our results showed women displayed a greater prevalence of any mood disorder, any anxiety disorder and the presence of both any mood and anxiety disorder. In patients with no history of CVD, there was no differences in the blood flow to the heart in men regardless of anxiety. However, in women with anxiety, there was a greater reduction of blood flow to the heart, than in women without anxiety. These relationships were not seen in people with a history of CVD.
Our results show that women with anxiety, who are unlikely to be referred for CR, should be considered as a high priority for testing and referral into CR. Our findings may explain why women have more advanced heart disease and have worsened outcomes when they are diagnosed, given their late referral for testing and enrollment into CR. Future research should to assess the long-term morbidity and mortality benefits of CR in this population."
Exercise training and inflammation in asthma patients: a randomized control trial,"['Paine, Nicola']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,364670,"Asthma is a disease which is characterized by high levels of inflammation in the blood. Lots of research has shown that aerobic exercise such as running or cycling can have health benefits for asthma patients, such as helping patients to control their asthma symptoms. Exercise training (like running or cycling) can also lead to a lowering in inflammation, but we do not know if lowering inflammation in asthma patients leads to better asthma control. In our study, we wanted to see if doing regular exercise would lead to lower inflammation, which would in turn lead to better asthma control. 

We took 66 adults who has diagnosed asthma but did not take regular exercise, and randomly allocated them to either 12-weeks of usual care (such as normal appointments with their doctor, taking their medication) or usual care plus aerobic exercise. The participants were split 50:50 into each group The aerobic exercise consisted of 3 supervised training sessions per week of cycling and running for 40 minutes, with a warm-up before and a cool down after exercise. The exercise level got harder as the weeks progressed. Patients completed a questionnaire to determine asthma control, and gave a blood sample at the start and end of the study so we could examine changes in inflammation. 

Our results showed that doing exercise led to lower inflammation levels, with there was no lowering of inflammation levels in the usual care group. However, the reductions in inflammation were not linked to improvements in asthma control, and changes in asthma control were the same in both exercise and usual care groups. 

In summary, our study found that while exercise lowered inflammation, these changes in inflammation were not linked to changes in asthma control in patients with asthma. We now need to work out how levels of inflammation that you find in mucus could be linked to exercise, and made better by exercise, and how this leads to better asthma control."

About 12 million new cases of Syphilis have been estimated per annum. All these sexually transmitted infections share common routes of transmission and facilitate disease progression and spread of HIV infection. Globally, a majority of individuals are unaware of their HIV/STI disease status due to inadequate care, and/or lack of access to timely screening and testing services. To increase disease detection of asymptomatic, marginalized at-risk populations and facilitate early treatment, agencies such as the UNAIDS, WHO and CDC, have called for scaling up of testing initiatives. Rapid diagnostic tests for HIV and STI's with their fast and accurate diagnoses aid in accomplishing these objectives. Oral rapid HIV tests are accurate but skepticism regarding their diagnostic accuracy prevails. Newer Antigen/Antibody based tests that detect acute infection are also available.To date, no meta-analyses has synthesized their diagnostic performance. Several newer studies on the rapid tests for Syphilis, Hepatitis B and C have been published yet no systematic review has synthesized their diagnostic accuracy. In this context, we propose three systematic reviews and meta-analyses to evaluate the overall performance (i.e., diagnostic accuracy and outcomes such as feasibility, acceptability, uptake, impact and cost effectiveness) of rapid tests for HIV, Syphilis, Hepatitis B and C. These reviews will not only generate evidence to help modify diagnostic algorithms for screening and diagnostic testing of vulnerable at risk populations but also inform and facilitate formation of new evidence based global and domestic guidelines to optimize testing initiatives for them."

We will test our strategy for its speed, and efficiency in triaging populations to care or prevention in 550 patients in both Manipal, India and in Cape Town, South Africa (1100 participants total), and compare it to the conventional COVID-19 testing strategy in 1100 participants. This innovative, digital strategy will be open access and will impact pandemic control globally.

AnkaSmart!, a connected digital platform involving a wearable device, mobile application, and website, facilitates education, health tracking, and connection to healthcare for menstruators, allowing them to make informed, proactive decisions about their sexual, menstrual, and reproductive health. 
In this study, we will determine the feasibility of using such platform, whether participants are able to accurately record their symptoms and conveniently connect to healthcare providers, and if the solution aids in preventative detection of menstrual abnormalities.
We will offer AnkaSmart! to cis-gender women and gender diverse people, who seldom access general care in community-based clinics in India. They will be recruited from the peri-urban slums of Mumbai, where they reside, oriented to the platform interface by the research team, and use the solution over 6 months to track their SRH, while seeking evidence-based education through the platform and connecting to care when necessary. We will also compare responses to concurrent controls who will avail the standard of care. We expect that AnkaSmart! will empower all menstruators to make timely, calculated health choices; allow for an early detection of menstrual abnormalities through consistent health tracking on the wearable device; and generate data that is currently unavailable, to inform policy. We aim to improve reproductive health outcomes. Our results will guide SRH care policy for cis-women and gender diverse people in India and worldwide."

This relationship is especially nuanced within adolescents and young adults, particularly those who identify as racialized, are Indigenous, and/or are LGBTQ2S+. To understand this relationship, we are proposing an intensive qualitative study looking at the experiences of marginalized youth in the Ottawa area. Through Photovoice and duoethnographic dialogues, we aim to understand the lived experiences of young adults with mental illness and the role of cannabis in managing their mental health daily.  These methods aim to elicit explanatory models of substance use and illness that reflect situational experiences with mental health and cannabis use. These situational, and dialogue-based experiences are often ignored from mainstream research, however, contain information about important environmental and contextual factors necessary to engage with for meaningful public health research, especially among marginalized populations. We hope to evaluate trends in the use of cannabis and mental health in a safe and supportive community setting where youth participants are encouraged to focus on both positive and negative experiences with cannabis in a forum that does not promote or vilify its use. We aim to co-create policy briefs based on the study data and disseminate this information to local stakeholders, including our community-based partners.

A Canadian study is following the only patients in North America receiving injectable treatment for chronic heroin dependence under the supervision of health care providers. Patient engagement in treatment is critical as it affects health outcomes and overall health care costs and efficiency. Studies of patients with chronic conditions such as diabetes have shown that communication between patients and health care providers is crucial to providing quality care, improving health, and helping patients to manage the complications that come along with their conditions. 

This suggests that patient provider communication may be a central component of care for patients with heroin addiction, and a tool to better engage these patients in health care services. This study will collect information on patient contact with treatment services (e.g. number of days of contact) on a monthly basis for 12 months. Patients representing different patterns of contact will be interviewed to explore their unique experiences communicating with providers. This will be the first study to explore the role of patient provider communication on improving the self-management of chronic heroin dependence. This evidence will bring forward areas of patient provider communication that could make a difference in improving treatment adherence for thousands of patients."
Overdose and recidivism among people with criminal justice system involvement and substance use disorders: Identifying longitudinal trends during dual public health emergencies in British Columbia,"['Palis, Heather']",['N/A'],"['Administrative Health Data', 'Concurrent Substance Use Disorders', 'Criminal Justice System Involvement', 'Dual Public Health Emergencies', 'Longitudinal Analysis', 'Opioid Agonist Treatment', 'Overdose', 'Recidivism', 'Risk Mitigation Guidance', 'Substance Use Disorder']",135000.0,440735,"People with criminal justice system involvement (e.g. incarceration, criminal charge or conviction) are more likely to use illicit substances (e.g. heroin, methamphetamine) compared to the general population. Those who do, are at higher risk of negative outcomes including overdose and more rapid and/or frequent return to custody. Efforts to address overdose, both in prisons and in the community, have been focused on treatment for people with opioid use disorder, by prescribing opioid agonist treatment. This alone may not be sufficient to reduce illicit opioid use, particularly among people who also use other substances. In March 2020, in the context of COVID-19, British Columbia's Ministry of Health took a significant step to expand access to prescription alternatives to the toxic drug supply and provided doctors with new guidelines and permissions for prescribing opioids, stimulants, benzodiazepines, and alcohol withdrawal management medications to people at risk of overdose.

The goal of this study is to evaluate whether these guidelines, which account for coexisting substance use disorder diagnoses, are effective at reducing overdose and criminal justice system involvement. Provincial health and criminal justice records will be examined to identify how many people with and without criminal justice system involvement have substance use disorder diagnoses (and which type of diagnosis) in British Columbia. Trends of overdose and criminal justice system involvement will then be examined, to identify whether there were any changes after opioid agonist treatment expansion efforts, or after the new treatment guidelines introduced in March 2020. Findings will highlight gaps in substance use services in British Columbia, and will inform policies and services intended to reduce overdose in both criminal justice and community health systems."
Pursuing change in illicit stimulant use in the context of daily injectable opioid agonist treatment: a grounded theory study with patients at Vancouver's Crosstown Clinic,"['Palis, Heather']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,400428,"For people with severe opioid use disorder (i.e. heroin addiction) not responding to first-line treatments, evidence supports the effectiveness of injectable opioid agonist treatment (iOAT), where patients inject pharmaceutical-grade opioids daily under the supervision of nurses. Outcomes include significant reductions in opioid use, crime, health improvements, and modest declines in illicit stimulant use (i.e. cocaine and amphetamines). This study was the first to investigate the experiences of iOAT patients that use illicit stimulants. The study aimed to investigate from the perspective of patients, the processes by which their use of illicit stimulants changed in context of daily iOAT care. Qualitative interviews were done with 31 patients at the first iOAT clinic in North America. Using a grounded theory approach sampling, data collection, and data analysis were conducted in a back and forth process. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The process of changing stimulant use in iOAT care was found to have four stages: 1) building capacity: where daily iOAT medication offered a sense of ""freedom"", and contact with care providers offered ""connection""; 2) realizing potential: where participants described  ""identifying evolving goals"" (e.g. relationships, health, employment) and ""finding hope"", seeing these goals as realistic; 3) taking action: where participants described ""gaining control"" over their stimulant use (e.g. practicing financial responsibility) and engaging in meaningful alternative activities (e.g. hobbies); 4) sustaining change: where participants described ""recognizing progress"" and ""becoming experts"" in their own health and service needs. When integrated, these four stages form the process of ""pursuing change"". Findings can support clinicians in understanding patients' evolving needs relating to their pursuit of stimulant use recovery in the context of iOAT care as treatment with injectable opioids expands across Canada."

Social determinants of children's neurodevelopment - A scoping review.,"['PALMIS, Sarah W']",['N/A'],"[""Bourses De Voyage D'Aci""]",1500.0,495271,"Pediatric brain health and neurodevelopment are influenced by various social factors. These factors, known as social determinants of brain health (SDBH) encompass various personal, social, economic, and environmental factors that influence health and neurodevelopmental outcomes. 

Recently, the emphasis has been placed on how social determinants of brain health (SDBH) and early life events could impact children's developmental outcomes. Despite growing interest in this area, there is no consensus on how to measure these factors, making it difficult to understand their impact on brain health.
 
To fill the knowledge gap, we will conduct a review of the literature to summarize what social determinants have been the most used in the pediatric literature and which one have been associated with neurodevelopment.  
 
This review will follow the recommendations for Scoping Reviews to map existing published literature systematically. The literature search will be performed using the PUBMED and Google Scholar databases. Screening will be conducted by two reviewers and data will be charted, collated and narratively synthesized. 
 
Our preliminary search has led to the selection of 191 articles published between 2013 and 2023. This search allowed us to narrow down our research questions and keywords. 
The main literature review is currently ongoing and will include articles published since 1980 focusing on North American human pediatric (healthy and clinical) populations. 
 
Previous studies have focused mainly on maternal education and household income, but less is known about other social determinants such as neighborhood quality. We anticipated that brain health is shaped by a multi-dimensional overlapping of factors and this scoping review will summarize all the social determinants and identify which are most important for children's neurodevelopment."

Objective: To conduct an extensive analyses of the effects, costs, and cost-effectiveness of SIFs, NSPs and OAT, in Montreal, Quebec.
Methods: We will use patient-level data from administrative health data sets capturing inpatient, out-patient and publicly covered pharmaceutical dispensations; local cohort and surveillance data; and published literature to simulate the effects of SIFs, NSPS, and OAT on the population of PWID (18 years and older) living in Montreal. The data will be used to evaluate the effects of these interventions on skin, soft tissue and vascular infections

The results of these analyses will add much-needed insight into the burden of common and debilitating SSTVIs and anoxic/toxicity-related brain injury on the health of PWID, and the cost effectiveness of these harm reduction interventions in a city with a scattered population of PWID, whose primary drug is not opioid based, and where uptake of these interventions is not complete (e.g. SIFs not used at capacity)."
Evaluating the effects of British Columbia's Supervised Consumption and Overdose PrEvention Sites (SCOPES) Study,"['Panagiotoglou, Dimitra']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,399981,"In April 2016, British Columbia's Provincial Medical Officer declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency. This enabled the quick adoption of new harm reduction services to meet the needs of  people who use illicit drugs (PWUD). Beginning in December 2016, overdose prevention (OPSs) and supervised consumption (SCSs) sites opened across the province, including mobile units in Kelowna and Kamloops. 
Multiple studies have demonstrated the local effects of Vancouver's InSite program in reducing mortality and the transmission of infectious diseases. To date however, there have been no evaluations of the population-level health and health system effects of OPSs and SCSs. This includes a dearth of information on the effectiveness of SCSs/OPSs on mitigating severe overdose events and overdose-related sequelae, and the consumption of acute care services.
The objective of the project is to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the effects (including intended and unintended positive and negative consequences) of the newly implemented OPSs and SCSs on opioid overdose related events, health outcomes, and health services used. 
We will use the BC Overdose Cohort and modern epidemiologic and econometric methods to: a) conduct an exploratory analysis of the disease and health system burdens of severe opioid overdoses in BC; b) estimate the risk of overdose-related sequelae by overdose exposure, and the hazards of repeat overdose events on developing a sequela; and c) evaluate the population-level effects of the new SCSs and OPSs on overdose-related hospitalization, sequelae, and mortality events, and health services used. A timely evaluation of this set of interventions is critical to ensure we are responding appropriately to the opioid epidemic, and will fill in gaps in our collective knowledge to a growing international problem."

The guideline encouraged physicians to limit access to opioids to patients with no indication of past substance use disorder, taper patients whose daily dose exceeded new 'watchful dose' thresholds and prioritize nonpharmacologic therapy. Although intended for patients with chronic noncancer pain, incorrect interpretation of the guideline resulted in aggressive weaning without consent and caused debilitating pain, serious withdrawal symptoms, and increased risk of overdose for other patient groups (e.g., people living with cancer, acute pain, sickle cell disease, chronic kidney disease, diarrhea or cough). 

This project aims to measure the effects of the 2017 guideline on guideline exempt patients' access to opioids (e.g., patients experiencing acute pain following trauma or surgery, living with cancer, receiving palliative care, or otherwise treated with opioids for the management of chronic cough, diarrhea or conditions such as sickle cell anemia), and the effects of these changes on their health and health service use. 

We will use patient-level administrative health records from British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec to: 
1.Quantify the effect of the 2017 guideline on guideline exempt patients' access to opioids;
2.Compare the survival of patients on opioid analgesics to non-initiators, and determine if alternative pharmacotherapies are commensurate to opioids; and
3.Evaluate the population-wide costs and benefits of the 2017 guideline.

This project is of strategic importance to Health Canada. Results from the study will address the previously overlooked but critical question of the effects of aggressive prescription opioid interventions on patients' health, globally."

China's 56 ethnic groups (including the Han majority) represent diverse belief systems, cultural practices, and languages that can affect the sexual health and mental well-being of men who have sex with men (MSM). However, ethnocultural research among China's MSM remains scant. This study examines how ethnic affiliation, ethnic identity affirmation, and Mandarin proficiency may be impacting Chinese MSM's HIV vulnerability and psychological distress. 

Methods
From 2013-2014, structured questionnaires were administered at MSM HIV testing clinics in a multi-ethnic Northern Chinese megalopolis (n=400). Correlations were assessed with logistic regression. 

Results
Compared to ethnic Han, ethnic minorities from Southern China had greater odds of HIV infection [adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 7.40, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.33-23.47] and forced sex (AOR: 3.27, 95% CI: 1.12-9.52). Ethnic Muslims had lower odds of unprotected anal intercourse (AOR: 0.41, 95% CI: 0.21-0.82), but greater odds of circumcision (AOR: 2.62, 95% CI: 1.24-5.51). 

Weak sense of ethnic belonging was marginally associated with anxiety (AOR: 1.54, 95% CI: 0.99-2.38). Weak ethnic peer socialization was marginally associated with never testing for HIV (1.63, 95% CI: 0.93-2.86) and HIV infection (AOR: 2.08, 95% CI: 0.87-5.00). Poorer Mandarin proficiency was associated with anxiety (AOR: 2.59, 95% CI: 1.19-5.63) and marginally associated with forced sex (AOR: 2.43, 95% CI: 0.99-6.00).

Conclusion
Heterogeneous HIV vulnerabilities between ethnic groups challenge current practices of aggregating all ethnic minorities into one 'non-Han' category. The health implications of co-occurring ethnocultural and sexual marginalization in China warrants further research."

Growing up fast:  Exploring HIV risk among Adolescent caregivers in South Africa,"['Parashar, Surita']",['N/A'],"['Adolescence', 'Body Mapping', 'Care Giving', 'High Risk Sexual Behaviour', 'Hiv/Aids']",66000.0,195911,"Against a backdrop of rising adult morbidity and mortality fuelled by the world's largest HIV epidemic, there exists a growing demographic of adolescents in South Africa who are thrust into the precarious situation of having to provide care to their infected and affected family members. It is well documented in the literature how the stress of care giving undermines household capacity and stability, increasing the vulnerability of informal caregivers, but few studies have sought to assess the prevalence and characteristics of home care provided by adolescents and the associated risk for HIV exposure and acquisition. Young carers are additionally vulnerable due to a myriad of factors that are known predictors of high-risk sexual behaviour: loss of parental guidance at a crucial development stage; loss of income due to illness or death of a parent, which may be a driver of survival sex; and loss of opportunity to pursue education and income generating activities. While South Africa struggles to cope with the enormity of the HIV epidemics impact on their communities, adolescents remain both the hope and the angst of HIV prevention in this setting, where 2 million of the estimated 6 million HIV infections are amongst people between the ages of 15 and 24 years. While there is widespread speculation and little evidence regarding adolescent sexual health needs, the aims of this project are to contribute new knowledge regarding an important and neglected population by exploring caretaking responsibility, an understudied explanatory variable in South Africa's epidemic. The findings will advance new understandings of youth vulnerability and resiliency, which may help to address the sexual health needs of this globally important group in diverse socio-cultural and geographic contexts, including with at-risk and vulnerable youth in Canada. The findings of this study will empower the next generation of caregivers, policy-makers and educators to turn the tide on this pandemic."

Workplace exposures and prostate cancer: analysis and reporting on a Canadian population-based study,"['Parent, Marie-Elise']","['Benedetti, Andrea', 'Demers, Paul A', 'Lavoué, Jérôme', 'Peters, Cheryl E', 'Rousseau, Marie-Claude']","['Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Occupational Exposures', 'Prevention', 'Prostate Cancer', 'Risk Factors', 'Workplace']",608176.0,380352,"Each year, more than 21,000 Canadian men are diagnosed with prostate cancer. Because its causes have not yet been identified, ways to prevent it remain unknown. There is compelling evidence that the environment plays a role in the development of this cancer. Several chemicals are themselves carcinogens or act as hormone modulators, and could be at play. The workplace is a preferential window for studying environmental chemicals. Most workplace chemicals eventually find their way into the general environment so studying them bear relevance to the population at large. However, there has been very little research based on strong methodological protocols in this area. Benefiting from the support of several Canadian funding agencies, the largest and most comprehensive study ever conducted on workplace risk factors for prostate cancer was initiated in Montreal in 2002. Some 4,000 men were recruited and interviewed to elicit information on a wide range of sociodemographic, lifestyle and medical factors. Lifetime work histories, representing 15,727 detailed job descriptions, were collected and translated into exposure to hundreds of specific chemical agents. Using state-of-the art methodological approaches, we assembled an unparalleled occupational database enabling to study the role that lifetime exposure to occupational chemicals, night work and physical activity/inactivity play in prostate cancer development. The coding of this colossal occupational component was completed in 2015, but funding available could not support its analysis. CIHR funding is sought at this time to leverage this large effort and investment, to support the primary data analysis and dissemination of findings on 19 sub-groups of environmental exposures assessed in the workplace. Workplace research is a major driver of environmental protection. Study findings will serve as important evidence for establishing preventive measures against prostate cancer in Canada, and elsewhere in the world."

Most studies have focused on recreational physical activity, whereas workplace physical activity seems to have opposite effects on health, the so-called ""paradox of physical activity"". This could reflect inadequate evaluation of activities performed in previous studies. Thus, developing an improved tool to evaluate physical activity at work will help resolve ambiguities. The need: With large epidemiological studies, it is essential to have tools to characterize workplace energy expenditure which are reliable yet feasible. It has been demonstrated that work tasks can be gendered, i.e., differ between women and men holding the same occupation. No research tool taking sex and gendered tasks into account exists. Methods: We will create a tool called MET-JEM, a Job-Exposure Matrix based on metabolic equivalents (METs), which reflect the ratio of activity expenditure to that of the resting metabolic rate. Our tool will be built using data from 7 studies conducted in Montreal by our team in 1975-2016. Some 69,000 detailed job descriptions (for 15,371 participants, 5,251 females, 10,120 males) for jobs held from 1930-2016 were divided into up to 4 main tasks entailing different MET intensities. Each task was assigned a MET value based on Ainsworth's Compendium of Physical Activities. To construct the MET-JEM, information on METs will be aggregated across participants with the same occupation/industry, sex and jobs in the same time periods. Applications: MET-JEM will be available to the scientific community to be used in studies with information on occupation, which is commonly collected. Ultimately, the MET-JEM, by integrating sex and gender aspects, will help support adequate recommendations for disease prevention among women and men."

Assessing the analgesic effects of nicotine on pain threshold and tolerance in humans: An exploratory investigation,"['Parkerson, Hollyanne']",['N/A'],"['Analgesia', 'Anxiety', 'Nicotine', 'Pain', 'Smoking', 'Structural Equation Modeling']",52500.0,277276,"Close to 3 million Canadians suffer from pain (Statistics Canada, 2009), and the prevalence of back pain is higher among Canadian smokers (23.3%) than non-smokers (16%; Alkherayf & Agbi, 2009). The youth population is at greatest risk; smokers ages 20 to 29 are 80% more likely to report back pain than nonsmokers in the same age range. Further clarification of the relationship between pain and smoking is necessary to contribute to the improved health of Canadians. Research aimed at elucidating the association between smoking and back pain has revealed a dynamic interrelationship. Smoking has been conceptualized as an indirect causal factor in the development of certain pain conditions (Wei & Hui, 2010), but also as an analgesic, providing temporary relief of pain, thereby reinforcing smoking behaviours (see Shi et al., 2010). Thus, the relationship between pain and smoking might be self-perpetuating. Animal models have consistently demonstrated analgesic effects of nicotine, but results from human studies using experimental pain paradigms have been inconsistent (see Ditre et al., 2011). Differences in pain modality (e.g., heat, cold), pain induction stimuli (e.g., cold pressor, thermal pain, electrical pain), and sex may be responsible for the mixed evidence (Ditre et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2010), but standardization of procedures used to assess such effects is necessary to clarify the mechanisms underlying the observed relationship. The proposed investigation will address methodological short-comings in the smoking and pain perception literature by assessing the effects of nicotine on pain threshold and tolerance across experimental pain modalities and sex while controlling for smoking status. Clarification regarding the analgesic effects of nicotine will provide further insight into mechanisms responsible for the self-perpetuating cycle of smoking and chronic pain, and thereby inform preventative and intervention strategies."

Linking housing crisis to deaths of despair: A focus on Canada's metropolitan area,"['Park, Gum-Ryeong']",['N/A'],"['Housing Crisis', 'Mortality Inequality']",45000.0,476794,"Despite a well-established link between housing and health at the individual level, geographic variations of housing crisis and its effects on mortality rate is understudied. Given that an increasing number of urban residents experience housing crisis, such topics lay the foundations for understanding about how and whether (a) housing crisis pose a threat to population health and (b) socioeconomic factors can accelerate, or attenuate mortality risks caused by housing crisis. This question relates to the research area of deaths of despair (e.g., suicide, drug overuse and alcoholism), since housing crisis can cause hopelessness and loneliness.  
Using large scale data, such as Canadian Census and Canadian Vital Statistics Database, the proposal aims to estimate the link between housing crisis and mortality rates in census tracts in metropolitan areas of Canada. 
An area will be defined as in housing crisis if the following three criteria are verified: 
(1) (In) adequate housing: the percentage of rented occupied requiring major repairs 
(2) (Un) affordable housing: the percentage of residents paying 30% or more of income on housing costs  
(3) (Un) suitable housing: the percentage of residents with a bedroom shortfall based on the number of bedrooms, the number of household members and household composition. 
The outcome variable is the area-level mortality rate, by gender, age and cause of death. This study will also estimate whether the relationships between housing crisis and mortality rate vary according to regional socioeconomic factors such as GINI coefficient and marginalization index. Analyses will use geographic information system techniques and conventional statistical tests of association. 
This will be the first research to link housing crisis with mortality in metropolitan areas of Canada. This also can strengthen the rationale for inclusive housing strategies that improve population health."

Since 2016, more than 40,000 Canadians have died from drug poisonings.  A key feature of this crisis is the unpredictability of the drug supply, with novel agents (i.e. more toxic opioids such as carfentanil and additives like the ""zombie drug"" xylazine) intermittently contaminating the drug supply.  We will monitor substances in wastewater collected from diverse populations - small towns to large cities (and neighborhoods within), First Nations communities and high-risk facilities (e.g. shelters) to understand the distribution of substances across populations and over time.  

Aim-1.  We will develop and perfect processes to identify and quantify key drugs (and their metabolites) across diverse populations (ranging from cities to buildings).  We will monitor for new substances entering the supply.  

Aim-2:  We will determine how specific substances differ over time, and between populations.  We will correlate social and economic characteristics of each monitored population with measured substances to understand how use differs between areas, and the social factors associated with regional variation.  We will correlate how drug poisonings in different catchments correlate with substances.  

Aim-3:  We will develop tools that will allow real-time data on the changing nature of the drug supply to be shared with health providers, addiction experts and substance users - creating an early warning system that can save lives.

Research has indicated the potential role that supported housing interventions, such as Housing First (HF), may play in increasing appropriate treatment among the homeless. However, there is a gap in research concerning the impact of HF on the treatment of a wide range of prevalent health conditions among the homeless. The purpose of my doctoral research is to generate new knowledge with respect to the effect of HF on treatment engagement and continuity. Specifically, we will use data collected from 437 participants in the Vancouver At Home (VAH) study. VAH involves an experiment examining the effects of HF among homeless adults with mental illness in Vancouver, British Columbia (BC). Data related to treatment initiation and medication continuity will be obtained from PharmaNet, BC's province-wide database containing prescription drug dispensing data from all pharmacies. The proportion of participants initiating treatment involving medication and treatment continuity (calculated using an established formula known as the medication possession ratio) for mental disorders and infectious diseases among participants randomised to HF will be compared to those randomised to treatment as usual. This is the first study to investigate the effect of HF on treatment initiation and continuity for major groupings of treatable diseases among homeless mentally ill adults."

The Canadian government implemented physical distancing measures and widespread closure of public institutions. This resulted in social isolation, reduced access to support within schools and community settings, as well as fewer opportunities to engage in protective activities such as physical activity. These impacts are likely to have detrimental short- and long-term effects on youth mental wellbeing. Care for youth with mental health disorders was already overstretched and underfunded before the pandemic. Thus, there is a pressing need to partner with youth and families to target and improve youth mental wellbeing prior to the onset of a mental health disorder, as well as to conduct research on youth mental wellbeing needs related to pandemic recovery. Our team will address this gap through a national research study that will result in the development of a catalogue of recommendations specific to supporting youth mental wellbeing, and a digital tool to support youth mental wellbeing. This will be achieved in three phases of work: 1) expert consultation on data related to supporting youth mental wellbeing existing within our Pandemic Preparedness research program; 2) development of an innovative digital tool for youth mental wellbeing; and 3) assessment of the tool's usability and acceptability. This study will complement ongoing parallel research in youth currently being conducted by our team that involves partnering with Canadian youth and families to understand the unique implications of the pandemic on this vulnerable population. The ultimate goal of the proposed work is to build on this foundation by cataloguing recommendations specific to supporting youth mental wellbeing and developing a digital health tool in partnership with youth and families to support pandemic recovery and resilience in the face of emerging public health crises."

Expanding upon a one-year development grant (THE NINE GENDERS A Traditionalist way of organizing Indigenous gender, interpreting gender through an Indigenous worldview), the purpose of this community-based participatory project is to connect gender diverse people in examining the 9Genders' role in organizing gender, strengthening wellness and creating opportunities for on-the-land healing through ceremonies in Indigenous communities across Canada. Through the facilitation of sharing circles (Lavallée, 2009), research is woven into the ceremonies, serving to document experiences and insights related to wellness for gender diverse people. These circles will allow people to participate in developing a research question, identifying possible community wellness indicators relevant to 9Genders, and looking at ways we will move forward by exploring the grant objectives and future activities (Lavallée, 2009)."

Improvements in the health of the population in the future will be achieved by action on the social determinants of health. For example, where you live or work and how much money you have can determine whether you will be healthy or sick. The way that society is organized means that people have different opportunities and access to resources for health during their lives.  The commitment to improving overall health and addressing differences in health is described in many Canadian documents and has been endorsed by governments and leaders in public health.  Although health is determined by more than health care services, the health sector and particularly public health have an important role to play in strengthening action on the social determinants.  Currently, public health services in British Columbia are being reorganized and this is an important time for learning and enhancing the ability of public health services and practitioners to improve the effectiveness of public health services in responding to unfair differences in health particularly in the promotion of mental health and delivery of substance use services. An important aspect of this work is ensuring a strong public health system with public health providers that have the knowledge, skills, tools and resources to undertake this work.This research will contribute to increasing the effectiveness and contributions of public health for reducing unfair and inequitable differences in health.

On the contrary, negative social events such as conflicts or social rejection can have adverse health effects. However, the everyday mechanisms through which social relationships relate to health are still not well understood, and there is a need for more research to better understand these pathways.
The proposed study aims to address this gap in knowledge by using innovative methods to directly measure social encounters, emotional experiences, and stress physiology in the daily lives of older adults, as well as manipulating exposure to positive and negative social events in a laboratory setting. The study will also investigate whether savouring and physical activity act as important resources for health regulation. We will recruit 360 community-dwelling adults aged 65 years and above who will take part in a 2-hour baseline session, followed by 7 days of daily life assessments and a 1.5-hour exit session including a laboratory experiment. Findings of this study have the potential to significantly enhance our understanding of the ways in which social factors are linked with health in older adults. By identifying specific biological pathways that may accumulate over time and manifest in long-term health problems, the study could help inform public health efforts to improve older adults' health and support healthy aging. Specifically, the study will shed light on potential factors for resiliency, namely, savouring and physical activity, which could be targeted in future interventions to improve older adults' health outcomes."

The sponsorship of sports clubs is one type of marketing to which children and youth are exposed. Evidence from abroad suggests that this promotional technique, which allows for extended and repeated exposure to marketing, is frequently used to promote unhealthy foods. To date, no research has documented the extent and nature of food company sponsorship of sports clubs in Canada. Furthermore, little research has specifically examined the potential impact of this activity on the health of children and youth.
The purpose of this study is to determine the frequency and healthfulness of food company sponsorship of junior sports clubs in Canada and to examine its potential effect on the dietary behaviors of children and youth. To do so, this study will identify junior sports clubs for the 8 most popular sports among children and youth in 4 cities located across Canada. Sport club officials will be interviewed over the phone to identify all food company sponsors. Focus groups will be held with children and youth to explore their perceptions and attitudes toward food company sponsorship and sponsoring companies, and whether sponsorship influences their food purchasing or requesting behaviors.
This research is timely given that the federal government is expected to pass legislation in fall 2018 restricting unhealthy food marketing to children. This law, however, will not prohibit food company sponsorship of children's sports nor will it protect adolescents over age 12 from unhealthy food marketing. A review of this legislation is scheduled for 2025. During this review, the law will be evaluated, and its scope may be expanded should evidence support such action. Considering this window of opportunity, this research will provide critical evidence needed to consider the restriction of food company sponsorship targeting children and the extension of protections to adolescents."

Hypotheses: 1) Trauma and resiliency are significant determinants of HIV and HCV seroconversion among young Aboriginal women and men participating in the Cedar Project; 2) Young female participants who have experienced sexual abuse will be at greater risk for initiating sex work, injection opiate use and attempted suicide; 3) Young male participants who have experienced sexual abuse will be at greater risk for incidence of incarceration, crystal methamphetamine and solvent use; 4) Historical trauma among young Indigenous peoples must be addressed using a multidimensional approach at the individual, family, organizational, community and policy levels. 

Research Methods: I will utilize data from the Cedar Project, an ongoing CIHR funded initiative that monitors HIV and HCV among over 600 young Aboriginal people aged 14, 30 who use injection and non injection drugs in Vancouver, Prince George and Kamloops. Since 2003 the study has assessed demographic characteristics, historical and lifetime traumatic events, drug use patterns and sexual vulnerabilities among participants every six months.  Quantitative and ethnographic methods will identify both risk and protective factors for harms associated with sexual abuse among male and female participants."

The proposed doctoral research will examine the effects of such criminalization among Canadian sex workers, including the ability to organize for improved health and safety. In particular, this research will explore the ways that digital spaces, including advertising websites, and sex worker-run blogs, function as tools for sex workers to enhance their occupational health and safety (sexual and mental health, physical safety and access to health services), and mobilize for structural change, including law reform. Sex work criminalization, internet censorship, and limited digital access continue to hinder sex workers' utilization of online spaces previously found to improve physical safety and sexual health outcomes. In addition, throughout the COVID-19 crisis, sex workers have experienced severe income losses, greater risk of violence, and barriers to critical services. The pandemic also sparked a greater reliance on digital spaces, for facilitating sex work as well as community mobilization and emergency supports. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 crisis and more broadly, there is a need to understand how digital modes of community mobilization can be implemented and scaled up. This work will draw on a mixed-methods, community-based approach to determine the impact of digital use on sex worker health outcomes, and explore the ways that criminalization shapes sex workers' access to digital work environments and digital community mobilization. This work will address how digital community mobilization models can help support sex workers' occupational health and safety, with the hopes of informing infrastructure and public health policy, as well as law reform that will allow for greater uptake in digital access and collectivization among workers."

Informed by feminist leisure studies, I propose that the women's limited engagement in physical activity can be understood along a continuum of constraint and agency that is consistent with three distinct approaches to analyzing women's leisure (Shaw 1994). The first focuses on the constraints women face, as documented in the women's reports of lack of time, resources, and opportunities for leisure. The second analyzes the gendered nature of physical activity/leisure participation and how it reproduces gender relations and ageism. Efforts to accommodate women's domestic and caring responsibilities in order to engage in physical activity align with this approach.  Lastly, the third approach analyzes physical activity as a site of resistance to gender relations and norms. When women engage in male-dominated sports and/or prioritize physical activity over other responsibilities, they challenge gender norms. These findings are consistent with a recently developed framework for gender transformative health promotion."

The purpose of this project is to increase understanding of the factors impacting physical activity behaviour in rural communities to develop interventions based on community priorities and needs. 

Our research team includes a partnership between researchers, health system decision makers, and community champions. A strong partnership with regional health authorities means this research will have direct policy implications and ensure that knowledge generated will be used by health system decision makers. Working with a community engagement facilitator and local community champions, we will conduct focus groups with a diverse sample of six rural communities in the northern and interior regions of British Columbia. Focus group discussions will be supplemented with photographs taken by participants. Data will coded to a behaviour change framework to map barriers and facilitators, local resources, and social-cultural and environmental factors impacting physical activity behaviour for people living in rural communities. This conceptual model will enable the development and implementation of programming and policy that is driven by the community, for the community."

Wiidooktaadyang, an Anishinaabemowin term meaning ""we are helping each other,"" emphasizes relationality and recognizes that Indigenous peoples help each other to realize wellness. From this relational approach, the research team will explore how on- and off-reserve members, front-line service providers, and staff of Nipissing First Nation understand and experience wellness. The team will also inquire what is perceived as the ""appropriate kind of help"" to facilitate wellness. It was acknowledged by Nipissing First Nation leaders and Elders that a newly developed, community-based service-delivery model called Wiidooktaadyang can be further informed by a broader understanding of wellness. The knowledge gained from this exploration of Nipissing First Nation members' perceptions of wellness and appropriate help will be translated with an aim to facilitate implementation of the Wiidooktaadyang model. This Indigenous inquiry will begin by interviewing a minimum of 30 on-reserve and 30 off-reserve members, in addition to 30 key informants employed by Nipissing First Nation. Interviews will be conducted using a conversational method honouring the Anishinaabe oral tradition. An Advisory Committee, comprised of leadership, Elders and community members will guide the research process and will participate in the co-creation of knowledge. The project is designed to strengthen capacity for research by hiring a community-based research assistant and involving the Advisory Committee in all aspects of research. Deliverables will be shared in the form of community engagement workshops designed to translate this knowledge in a useful manner to inform the Wiidooktaadyang model. Results will also be shared with academia through peer-reviewed publications co-authored with Nipissing First Nation. This Indigenous inquiry can impact practice, policy, and culturally safe service in and beyond Nipissing First Nation."

Dismantling Dominant Discourse surrounding Complex Death with Urban Indigenous Youth Experience,"['Peltier, Shanna']",['N/A'],"['Complex Death', 'Decolonization', 'Indigenous Research Paradigm', 'Indigenous Youth', 'Life Promotion', 'Mental Health', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Suicide Prevention']",150000.0,437194,"Suicide is commonly described as an urgent health concern and tragedy. Indigenous peoples' in Canada are familiar with this devastating reality, whereby Indigenous youth are five to seven times more likely to die by suicide than non-Indigenous youth in Canada. Additionally, while health data related to suicide and suicidality (suicide attempts, thoughts, and plans) are slightly documented in on-reserve First Nations populations, instances of suicide, and inquiries into mental health more broadly, in urban-based Indigenous youth groups are vastly understudied and underreported. This gap is alarming given that the highest percentage of First Nations, and Metis youth who died by suicide, did so in an urban area. As a result of these gaps and inequities, this research aims to 1) develop a more contextual and nuanced understanding of complex death, specifically Indigenous deaths by suicide that considers social, economic, historical, ecological and political factors, and 2) this research aims to challenge dominant discourses of complex death by providing a space for a critically situated and experienced informed investigation that centers the voices of urban Indigenous youth.  This work will employ youth-engaged qualitative methods comprised of semi-structured interviews with urban-based Indigenous youth wellness facilitators in British Columbia. This research is aligned with critical suicide studies in that it critiques mainstream Western conceptualizations of suicide prevention and mental health intervention efforts as being largely inapplicable within Indigenous contexts (e.g. due to not incorporating decolonization frameworks). This work will contribute to an unexplored research area and provide empirical evidence for much-needed change in urban-based Indigenous youth's material, political and colonial realities. This timely research will have applied value in informing innovations in Indigenous mental health, educational and social service practice."
Exploring the association between rail transit investments and utilitarian walking in urban-dwelling Canadians,"['Pénicaud, Sidonie']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,364857,"Context: Public transit shows promise in increasing how much people walk every day. Walking to do every day activities such as shopping, going to work or school can be an easy way to do more physical activity. In turn, walking can help Canadians be healthier. Walking can decrease the chance of developing illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes. 
Methods: To look at the relationship between public transit and walking, we used data that had been collected for the National Population Health Survey (NPHS) by Statistics Canada. We looked at the amount of walking done every week by people who lived near (less than 2000 meters) from a new rail public transit station such as subway, light rail and commuter train stations that were built in several Canadian cities between 1994 and 2010 compared to people in the same neighborhood who lived far from a new station (more than 2000 meters). 
Results: 414 people lived near a new station while 5,014 lived far. People who lived near the station had 20% higher odds of walking one or more hours per week than those who lived far from the station. The extent to which the neighborhood was 'walk-friendly' also seem to influence how much people walked. Our study also found that there seems to have been an increase in the amount of time Canadians spend walking for everyday purposes between 1994 and 2010. 
Conclusion: Canadians living close to a new rail stations seemed to walk more than those who lived far from a new station. However, it was difficult to measure changes in the amount of walking related to the opening of new public transit stations because most Canadians were walking more in general during the time of the study."
Development and Feasibility Testing of a Home-Based Physical Activity Intervention for Family Caregivers of People with Advanced Cancer,"['Penner, Jamie L']",['N/A'],"['Affect', 'Family Caregiver', 'Fatigue', 'Palliative/End-Of-Life Care', 'Physical Activity', 'Pilot Study', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Subjective Sleep Quality']",110000.0,248090,"Families play an important role in the care of people with advanced cancer at home. However, facing the loss of a loved one and undertaking new and demanding responsibilities contribute to caregivers experiencing major sleep disturbances, high levels of fatigue, significant impacts on their physical health, and extreme psychological difficulties. Caregivers need to be able to care for themselves in order to protect their own health and continue to provide care. However, our knowledge about ways to help caregivers practice self-care is limited. The benefits of physical activity in healthy individuals, including helping them feel better, sleep better, and experience less fatigue, are well known. A home-based physical activity program is a logical way to address the self-care needs of family caregivers while respecting their desire to stay near the patient. A simple home-based physical activity intervention will be designed together with a physiotherapist. The intervention will consist of active lifestyle coaching with the aim of increasing caregivers' physical activity each week. How caregivers feel, their level of fatigue, and their self-perceived sleep quality will be measured at the start of the intervention and then every two weeks in order to evaluate the effects of the physical activity intervention. This initial study will be conducted to assess, revise, and finalize the details of the home-based physical activity intervention and determine the possibility of conducting a larger study. This intervention study is new and will provide guidance to health care providers that, if effective, will enable them to support family caregivers in addressing their self-care needs. The intervention will be designed to have minimal cost, which is expected to be outweighed by the economic benefit to our health care system as caregivers are kept healthier, potentially enabling them to provide care at home for a longer period and preventing them from becoming patients themselves."
Transition to parenthood: realistic sleep-related expectations as a protective factor for mothers' and fathers' mental health,"['Pennestri, Marie-Hélène', 'Dubois-Comtois, Karine', 'Zelkowitz, Phyllis']","['Béliveau, Marie-Julie']","['Actigraphy', 'Anxiety', 'Depression', 'Infant Development', 'Mental Health', 'Self-Report Measures', 'Sleep', 'Transition To Parenthood']",353203.0,381873,"The transition to parenthood is a challenging time of life. Postnatal mental health problems have major consequences in infants and parents. Among the different factors associated with mental health, postnatal sleep disruption was shown to be associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms in both others and fathers. However, although new parents are frequently sleep-deprived, not all of them develop mental health problems. Consequently, there is a need to identify protective factors for parents' mental health. While there is a lot of information circulating about sleep in early infancy, advice is too often contradictory, leading to unrealistic expectations in parents. In general,  unrealistic expectations have been identified as a factor inhibiting the transition to parenthood. Therefore, we propose that realistic parental sleep-related expectations will have a protective influence on parental mental health. The main objective of this research program is to better understand the association between infant's sleep patterns, parental sleep duration and quality, sleep-related expectations and mental health. We propose that realistic sleep-related expectations have a protective role for parental
mental health. First-time mothers and fathers will be recruited during pregnancy. Sleep measures (infant and parents), depressive and anxiety symptoms (parents) and sleep-related expectations (parents) will be measured during pregnancy, at 3 months postpartum, and at 6 months postpartum. Given the importance of sleep in new parents, this project is of great importance to knowledge dissemination. It will help us to identify new protective factors during the transition to parenthood and contribute positively to health care services provided to expectant and new parents. Incorporating both mothers' and fathers' point of view will advance knowledge in the field of transition to parenthood, and will promote optimal parental mental health and healthier development in infants."
The impact of cannabis legalization on the forensic mental health patient population in Ontario,"['Penney, Stephanie R', 'Schneider, Richard', 'Jones, Roland M', 'Simpson, Alexander I']","['Chatterjee, Sumeeta', 'Gerritsen, Cory J', 'Wilkie, Treena']","['Cannabis', 'Forensic Mental Health Services', 'Mental Health', 'Offending', 'Psychosis', 'Violence']",,418205,"On October 17, 2018, the Cannabis Act came into force, making Canada the fourth country in the world to legalize the recreational use and possession of cannabis nationwide. The impetus towards legalization has focused primarily on cost savings and public safety, without sufficient consideration of the impact on vulnerable persons such as youth and those with serious forms of mental illness (SMI). 
 
The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the potential harms and health-related impacts of cannabis legalization on a representative sample of psychiatrically complex and vulnerable individuals: users of forensic mental health services in Ontario. Consistent with the literature documenting risk enhancing effects of substance use in persons with SMI, we expect to see a higher rate of poor health outcomes and mental health deterioration, as well as other clinically adverse events (hospital readmission, longer durations of hospital stay, criminal offending), among patients if increased levels of cannabis use are observed as time elapses from the point of legalization. In addition to investigating effects on patients, we will assess changes in forensic clinician and decision-maker attitudes over time, with the hypothesis that attitudes will become more permissive with respect to cannabis use among forensic patients as time elapses from the point of legalization.

Although cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in the general population, its use among those with mental health problems is associated with a host of adverse clinical, health and public safety outcomes. With the recent legalization of cannabis in this country, now is a critical point in time to address the impact of cannabis use and its legalization on the forensic system and the patients under its care."

Advancing Peer-Delivered HIV Prevention Programs: Elucidating the Complex Role of Peer Workers,"['Penn, Rebecca']",['N/A'],"['Best Practices', 'Harm Reduction', 'Hiv Prevention Programs', 'Peer Work', 'Program Development', 'Service Delivery']",105000.0,245813,"Peer workers are members from a specific community who provide health information and support to others of the same community. Peer outreach has been a crucial component in HIV prevention programs because peers are able to reach members of their community who do not typically access these services, and act as a bridge between the community and formal health care services. Because peer workers tend to be seen as trustworthy, the services they offer gain legitimacy in the eyes of their community. However, little is known about the nature of peer work and the effect of the work itself on peer workers. This community-based qualitative research project asks novels questions about peer work, including how role challenges affect peers and their ability to provide services.  Peers wear different hats - they are clients and patients, they are service providers, and they are friends of the people to whom they provide services. It can be unclear for peer workers in which capacity they should respond in a given situation. The boundaries between these different roles are often blurry and can create tensions for the peer workers who are on their own journeys of recovery and development. The project involves interviewing 20 peer workers and 10 program supervisors from community health centres in different areas of Toronto and then teasing out their stories to create a narrative of peer workers' experiences. This research will provide a more nuanced and complete picture of peer work, and will contribute to the theoretical and practical literature upon which peer program best practices may be developed."

Over 6 million Venezuelans have been displaced due to ongoing political turmoil and resulting humanitarian crises; over 1 million live in Peru. This has strained Peru's healthcare system and reshaped its HIV epidemic. Venezuelan migrants face intersecting forms of socio-structural disadvantage that negatively impact their health-precarious employment, xenophobia and material deprivation. These systemic inequities can lead to engagement in sex work, particularly for women, girls and sexual and gender minorities. There is urgent need to assess the unique interactions between disease and social conditions that both place adult VSW at risk for HIV/STBBIs and limit their resulting care engagement. To fill this gap, we will apply Syndemic theory to assess heightened risk of HIV/STBBIs acquisition, and lower care engagement, among VSW. This three-year mixed-methods study will: 1) Explore synergistic migration and sex-work related vulnerabilities and HIV/STBBI needs via focus groups (n=6) and interviews (n=60) ; 2) Characterize the prevalence and distribution of HIV/STBBI (chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, HPV) (N=300); and 3) Translate findings into intersectoral action via iterative stakeholder consultations (n=10) and a 1-day stakeholder engagement workshop (n=20).

HPV is the primary cause of cervical cancer. HPV causes an estimated 90% of anal, 40% of penile, and 12% of oral cancers. In both men and women, HPV can also cause genital warts. Health Canada has approved and recommended a safe and effective HPV vaccine for both males and females aged 9-26 years. In Canada, publicly funded school-based HPV vaccine programs are currently available to girls aged 9-13 years. Some provinces offer catch-up programs for girls up to 18 years old. Across Canada, HPV vaccination rates among females vary and are often too low to protect the entire population. We do not know HPV vaccine uptake rates in Canadian boys. Parents of boys who wish to obtain the vaccine must assume the cost (approximately $300-400 for 3 doses). Therefore, parents must evaluate many factors (e.g.,benefits vs. costs, sesocial influences) before deciding whether or not to vaccinate their sons. We are interested in what parents know about HPV and the HPV vaccine, their attitudes towards the vaccine and which factors influence their decision-making process. First, we will conduct a random Canada-wide online survey of 3500 parents of boys (aged 9-16) to assess knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about the HPV vaccine. Parents will be grouped according to their stage of adoption in the decision-making process. Second, we will conduct a follow-up study 6 months later to assess whether parents' vaccination decision stage has changed and which factors influenced these changes. This survey data will provide us with a recent estimate of HPV vaccine uptake rates in young Canadian males. This is one of the first studies that aims to identify the key factors that influence changes in parents' HPV vaccine decisions over time. The results of this study will better inform public health strategies and the development of educational interventions (e.g.pamphlets, videos) to prevent HPV and HPV-related cancer"
"Wellness in Indigenous communities: community perception of current future visions of well-being in two Indigenous communities in Quebec, Canada","['Périllat-Amédée, Sonia']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2650.0,391755,"Background/Objectives
Well-being in Indigenous communities is often assessed through  socioeconomic approaches. Moreover, assessment of community well-being tends to be done through  assessments focused on individuals. Considering Indigenous people perceive well-being wholistically, this research aims to identify wholistic concepts of well-being from the perspectives of Indigenous community members. These concepts will inform the development of indicators, which will be used to assess the state and evolution of Indigenous community well-being.
Methods
A joint Community Mobilization Training (CMT) was delivered in two Indigenous communities in Quebec: one is urban, with diverse indigenous Peoples, the other one is a rural Atikamekw First Nation reserve. Participants are members of the communities, who work in a health- or well-being-related field. As part of the training, attendees (n=15 to 20) participate in talking circles to elaborate on indicators of well-being in their community. Four additional discussion groups will be held with other members of the community who self-identify as Indigenous. Participants will be youth, aged 15 to 25 (n=10 to 16) and self-identified elders (n=10 to 16) selected with a community research assistant. Talking circles will be recorded and transcribed verbatim, and analyzed through inductive coding to identify recurrent indicators and determinants of well-being. Talking circles are a group discussion method grounded in the communities' culture, and  give everyone the same opportunity to share experiences and thoughts when they have a talking stick which is passed around the circle. Participating youths will have the opportunity to experience research and gain skills as co-researchers, i.e. facilitating talking circles with elders, translating between Atikamekw and French, analyzing and interpreting the results, and disseminating the results both in and outside their community.

More and more children are cared for in Early Childhood and Education and Care (ECEC) programs such as child care centres and nursery schools. There is research showing that the quality of these programs influences how well children do socially, cognitively and emotionally. As a result, governments are increasing funding to programs that support young children (e.g., Ontario, Prince Edward Island and British Columbia are in the process of implementing costly full-day Junior and Senior Kindergarten programs).
     Quality characteristics like staff:child ratios, staff training and education and health and safety practices have been linked to children's wellbeing. However, there are many studies in this area, these studies use different methodologies and some of the findings are inconsistent. This makes it hard to draw conclusions about which aspects of ECEC program quality are most important for children. Our goal is to conduct a series of systematic reviews of the literature to explore and compare which aspects of quality in ECEC programs impact children's wellbeing. 
     We plan to follow a rigorous process for searching, selecting and extracting information from existing studies. If possible, we will combine results and perform meta-analyses. This information is critical to parents, governments, policy makers, practitioners of various disciplines and researchers whose goals are to improve the overall developmental outcomes of individual children and for future generations."

Il vise à évaluer l'impact de déménager dans un nouveau logement sur la santé mentale des mères (évaluée à l'aide de questionnaires avant-après le déménagement) et sur la dynamique familiale (décrite lors d'entrevues individuelles auprès de 24 mères avec jeunes enfants). Le 2e volet vise à évaluer l'impact des conditions de logement sur le développement moteur, cognitif et socio-émotif des enfants (0-11 ans). Pour ce faire, j'utiliserai les données québécoises de l'Enquête régionale sur l'éducation, l'emploi et la petite enfance chez les Premières Nations (3540 répondants), une enquête développée par et pour les Premières Nations. Les deux volets de mon projet seront développés en étroite collaboration avec les communautés autochtones. Mon objectif au final est de fournir des résultats permettant d'informer les prochaines politiques de logement en contexte autochtone autour d'enjeux jugés pertinents par les familles autochtones, permettant d'améliorer la santé des familles et le développement des enfants."
"Évaluation économique d'interventions qui touchent le logement et la santé : éclairer les décisions, réduire les inégalités sociales de santé et préparer l'avenir pour une société résiliente post-pandémie.","['Perreault, Karine']",['N/A'],"['Analyse Coûts-Bénéfice', 'Déterminants Sociaux De La Santé', 'Logement', 'Équité En Santé', 'Évaluation Économique En Santé']",76498.0,449237,"Les évaluations économiques en santé sont des outils qui permettent de prendre en considération l'efficience économique d'interventions en santé, c'est-à-dire d'en comparer les coûts et les bénéfices en fonction des objectifs visés. Dans le secteur public, l'efficience économique est un enjeu ayant un grand pouvoir d'influence sur les décisions, et cela est tout à fait compréhensible : il en va de l'intérêt public de s'assurer que les ressources collectives sont mobilisées de façon à produire les meilleurs résultats possibles. Le présent programme de recherche place le logement sous la loupe des évaluations économiques en santé pour plusieurs raisons. D'abord, le logement est une responsabilité qui touche l'ensemble des paliers de gouvernements et qui concerne la totalité de la population : tout le monde a besoin d'un toit. Ensuite, l'exposition aux conditions de logement est importante et répétée, puisqu'il s'agit d'un lieu central du quotidien, particulièrement dans le contexte actuel. La pandémie a d'ailleurs mis en lumière les inégalités de logement et les conséquences disproportionnées pour les groupes les plus vulnérables (personnes âgées, groupes autochtones, victimes de violence, etc.). Les décisions quant aux investissements publics ayant pour effet de modifier l'offre de logement ont des impacts à grande portée sur la santé physique et mentale des populations. Les autorités canadiennes de santé publique ont identifié le logement comme un des quatre domaines d'intervention à fort potentiel d'impact pour favoriser la résilience et l'équité en santé post-pandémie. Comme son titre l'indique, ce stage postdoctoral vise à réaliser une analyse des coûts et bénéfices d'interventions qui touchent le logement et la santé, au Québec, de façon à guider les décisions et réduire les inégalités sociales de santé. Les conclusions seront applicables à l'ensemble du Canada et seront utiles dans la transition péri/post-pandémie."
The underlying epigenetic mechanisms in the association between childhood victimization and suicidal risk,"['Perret, Lea C']",['N/A'],"['Birth Cohort', 'Depression', 'Epidemiology', 'Epigenetics', 'Peer Victimization', 'Suicide', 'Youth']",1000.0,412159,"Over 20% of adolescents report being bullied by their peer group. Prior research indicates that being bullied in childhood is often associated with poorer mental health. For example, depressive symptoms, suicidal thoughts and behaviours can occur at the time, and sometimes persist into midlife. The underlying processes linking childhood bullying to increased depressive symptoms, including suicidal thoughts and behaviours, in adolescents and adults are unknown. One possibility is that being bullied, like other stressful life experiences, can result in biological changes such as the addition of molecules called methyl groups to various locations in the DNA. When these methyl groups are added at the beginning of genes, they can change how strongly different genes work. These methylation marks may fade with time or remain for decades. Hence, this study will first investigate whether people who were bullied in childhood tend to have different patterns of methylation marks in late adolescence and mid-adulthood. Furthermore, whether these different methylation patterns are an underlying mechanism linked to the development of suicidal risk. This research will allow to disentangle the role of genes, environment, and their interactions in the development of suicidal risk. We hope it will further our understanding of the contribution of different risk factors; environmental, genetic, or both, linked to suicidal risk and childhood bullying."
Genetic variation at the LPA locus and risk of calcific aortic valve stenosis in patients undergoing cardiac surgery,"['Perrot, Nicolas']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,382936,"Calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) is the narrowing of the exit of the left ventricle of the heart and is the most common form of heart valve diseases.  Surgical replacement of the aortic valve is the only effective treatment for CAVS. The circulating level of Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is largely determined by genetic variation in the gene coding for the apolipoprotein(a), an essential component of Lp(a). Previous studies have identified that gene variants impacting on Lp(a) levels were associated with CAVS and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk. The objective of this study was to test the association between genetically elevated Lp(a) levels and the risk of CAVS in a cohort of patients undergoing a heart surgery including controls with CAD. 
We performed a genetic association study in the Quebec City Case-Control Calcific Aortic Valve Stenosis Cohort (QUEBEC-CAVS), which includes patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The cohort included 1001 patients undergoing aortic valve replacements (AVR) for CAVS and 1017 control patients with CAD undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting and without valvulopathy. In patients with CAVS, 58,1% had concomitant CAD. A weighted genetic risk score (GRS) based on three genetic variants known to affect Lp(a) levels was used. Increase of the GRS was associated with a 2 folds higher risk of CAVS. In sensitivity analysis including only CAVS cases with CAD, the GRS remained associated with the risk of CAVS. 
This study shows that genetically elevated Lp(a) level is causally associated with the risk of CAVS, independently of the presence/absence of CAD. Targeting Lp(a) could be an effective strategy for CAVS prevention and/or treatment, including in individuals with documented CAD."
A Biopsychosocial Approach to Understanding the Impact of Osteoarthritis on Social Participation: A Population-based Study,"['Perruccio, Anthony', 'Badley, Elizabeth M']","['Gignac, Monique A']","['Activity', 'Gender', 'Icf Framework', 'Mobility', 'Osteoarthritis', 'Pain', 'Population', 'Social Participation']",70000.0,353423,"While the definition of healthy aging across studies is variable, the focus has been dominated largely by disability in activities of daily living; this is particularly true within osteoarthritis research. This is in contrast to findings from studies which report that older individuals identify healthy/successful aging more so with social participation and engagement than with activity limitations and disease per se, though these are identified as important as well.
   Pain and activity limitations are among the strongest predictors of social participation. Osteoarthritis is a leading cause of pain and activity limitations in the population. The prevalence of osteoarthritis increases significantly as people age, and because our population is aging, osteoarthritis poses a significant threat to social participation, and hence healthy ageing. Yet, there has been little work that has examined social participation in osteoarthritis in the population.
   This proposal investigates the relationship between osteoarthritis and social participation in a large population-based and representative Canadian sample. Our goal is to understand how osteoarthritis affects pain, which in turn affects activity and mobility, which then affects social participation. We further consider that the relationships between these may be different depending on personal (e.g. gender) and environmental (e.g. available social supports) factors. Only by understanding the pathways that lead from disease to participation can targeted efforts be developed to increase the chances that individuals experience healthy and successful aging."
Profiling heart disease risk factors in osteoarthritis: multi-joint symptoms and sex,"['Perruccio, Anthony', 'Badley, Elizabeth M']","['Heckman, George A']","['Heart Disease', 'Inflammation', 'Multi-Joint', 'Osteoarthritis', 'Population', 'Sex']",23000.0,389811,"Osteoarthritis and heart disease are among the most common chronic conditions in the population, and they occur together more frequently than would be expected by chance.  Osteoarthritis has been identified as a risk factor for later heart disease, and not the other way round. This risk remains even when traditional heart disease risk factors, which themselves may be associated with osteoarthritis, such as obesity, disability, and lack of physical activity, are considered.  This risk is substantially higher for women, and possibly for people with osteoarthritis at more than one joint site (multi-joint osteoarthritis). Why there is an increased risk is unclear, and this represents an important gap in our knowledge.
Important biologic mechanisms for the association likely relate to inflammation and metabolic factors. Using the comprehensive sample of the Canadian Longitudinal Study in Aging, we propose to investigate the profile of risk factors for heart disease in osteoarthritis, including biological and self-reported data, hypothesizing that these profiles will differ by sex and number of joint sites affected. In addition, because data on joint symptoms indicative of osteoarthritis are available for individuals who did not report an osteoarthritis diagnosis, will expand the investigation to consider individuals with 'possible- osteoarthritis'. Improving overall risk-stratification for heart disease for people with osteoarthritis is important for enhanced approaches to prevention and treatment, and will lay groundwork for further investigation to understand the link between osteoarthritis, heart disease, and potentially other conditions of aging."
Cardiovascular disease onset in osteoarthritis: a longitudinal investigation of the role of sex and multijoint symptoms,"['Perruccio, Anthony', 'Badley, Elizabeth M']","['Eder, Lihi']","['Cardiovascular Disease', 'Multijoint', 'Osteoarthritis', 'Population', 'Sex']",70000.0,481302,"Osteoarthritis (OA) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are among the most common diseases in the population, and occur together more frequently than expected by chance.

The risk is substantially higher for females, and possibly for those with OA at multiple joint sites. Why there is an increased risk is unclear. This represents an important knowledge gap.
Important biologic mechanisms for the association likely relate to inflammation and metabolic factors. Using baseline data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study in Aging, we found that apart from body mass index (the largest contributor in both sexes), systemic inflammation was the predominant contributor to overall CVD risk profile in females, compared to metabolic factors and smoking in males. Also, while OA overall was associated with a worse CVD profile, OA was increasingly associated with worse CVD risk thresholds among females with multijoint OA, but not males. This suggests unique CVD risks by sex/multijoint subgroups, and point to a potentially important role for inflammation in OA over and above traditional CVD risk factors.
This prior work was cross-sectional, and risks over time could not be investigated. Now, with longitudinal data available and considering an expanded list of potential risk factors, we will investigate CVD onset risk, hypothesizing that these will differ by sex and single/multijoint OA. 
Improving overall risk-stratification for CVD for people with OA is important for enhanced approaches to prevention and treatment, and will lay groundwork for further investigation to understand the link between OA, CVD, and potentially other conditions of aging."

Gendered impacts of colonialism are embedded within pre-existing social and structural violence and inequities (e.g., racism, stigma, violence, discrimination) and shape the needs, access, and utilization of health services for Indigenous women, gender diverse, and Two-Spirit Peoples. Climate change has created new challenges and Indigenous Peoples are highly vulnerable to it's impacts. Indigenous knowledge on climate change and health-related impacts have been largely overlooked in research and policy. The intersecting challenges of health inequities, social and environmental injustices, and climate change calls for ways to create healthier and sustainable futures for Indigenous Peoples. The purpose of this mixed-methods study is to evaluate the ongoing impacts of racism and climate change on health inequities, access to healthcare and lived experiences of Indigenous women, gender diverse, and Two-Spirit Peoples. This study will utilize Indigenous research, structural violence, planetary health, and intersecting stigmas frameworks to examine the underlying systemic drivers (e.g., systemic racism, healthcare and climate change policy) of health-related inequities and access among Indigenous women, gender diverse, and Two-Spirit Peoples. The project will leverage a CIHR-funded mixed-methods cohort of Indigenous women, gender diverse, and Two-Spirit Peoples in Vancouver, BC (PI: Bingham) and utilize mixed methods and braiding analysis to triangulate Indigenous knowledge, survey, and qualitative data. Findings will be translated for local Indigenous communities, and nationally to provide novel insights into ways that we can create safer healthcare spaces, address health inequities, and prepare for climate related impacts on Indigenous health and health access."

Population: Pregnant patients who have trouble affording basic necessities (""making ends meet"") and who are at elevated risk of preterm birth due to either a prior premature singleton birth (<37 weeks) or smoking and nulliparity.
Interventions: (1) a $100 per month income supplement and (2) midwifery-led care including screening and treatment of genital tract infections and smoking cessation.
Comparator: Usual care and supports
Outcomes:
Primary outcome: Gestational age at birth
Secondary outcomes: Any preterm birth; each mutually exclusive subcategory of premature birth including extremely preterm (less than 28 weeks), very preterm (28 to 31 weeks+6 days), moderate to late preterm (32 to 36 weeks+6 days); term birth; post-term; stillbirth; and pregnancy loss"
"The experiential and cultural dimension of female bisexuality in Canada: What are the clinical implications of being ""in-between""?","['Persson, Tonje J']",['N/A'],"['Bisexuality', 'Culture', 'Depression And Anxiety', 'Female Sexuality', 'Health Behaviour', 'Language', 'Pre-Disposing Factors', 'Quantitative', 'Rural Vs Urban', 'Societal Dimensions Of Health']",105000.0,229535,"Of all sexual orientations, female bisexuality is the one the least understood due to a lack of research. Although some studies have indicated that women who self-identify as bisexual may have poorer mental health than both heterosexual and lesbian women, little is known about why they appear to be at increased risk. One potential explanation may be that they feel they do not fit into either the mainstream heterosexual culture or the lesbian sub-culture.  This marginalization could be a predisposing factor for mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, self-harm, and suicide. 
Further, when understanding female bisexuality it may be important to take into account the cultural setting in which the individual is located. However, no research has investigated whether the lived experience of female bisexuality is related to living in a large urban versus in a small-town setting. In addition, no studies have looked at if French or English cultural affiliation may be associated with the mental health of female bisexuals. 
The current epidemiological study will attempt to address these gaps in the literature by recruiting 300 women, equally split into heterosexual, lesbian, and bisexual groups, from Montreal (English and French cultural affiliation, urban setting), Quebec City (French small-town, and Kingston (English small town). Through questionnaires the study will aim to investigate the relation between sexual, emotional, social, and cultural factors to mental health, depression and anxiety in particular. The ultimate goal is to identify the predisposing factors associated with poor prognosis for women who identify as bisexual. 
At the moment, there is little support available for bisexual women. It is hoped that the current research, through identifying which factors predispose bisexual woman to psychological problems, may lead to developing effective mental health prevention and intervention strategies to meet the needs of this relatively neglected group."
Assessing the psychometric properties of the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale-2 in relation to the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire in a sample of immigrant and refugee adolescents attending welcoming classes in Montreal,"['Persson, Tonje J']",['N/A'],"['Adolescents', 'Depression', 'Immigrant', 'Mental Health', 'Psychometric Properties', 'Psychosocial Adjustment', 'Refugee', 'Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale-2', 'School-Based Intervention', 'Strenghts And Difficulties Questionnaire']",17500.0,182431,Not applicable
Characterization and development of a 'multidimensional micronutrient vulnerability index' to identify and reach populations at risk for micronutrient deficiencies,"['Perumal, Nandita']",['N/A'],"['Econometrics', 'Epidemiology', 'Global Health', 'Health Services Research', 'Maternal And Child Health', 'Micronutrient Deficiencies', 'Multi-Level And Structural Equation Modelling', 'Policy And Advocacy', 'Poverty']",105000.0,327831,"Chronic deficiency in essential vitamins and minerals (micronutrients), also known as 'hidden hunger', afflicts an estimated 2 billion lives globally, and is associated with poor physical, mental and economic growth at the population-level. The gold standard for recognizing 'hidden hunger' is to measure the concentration of vitamins and minerals in the blood using biological measures. However, this approach is extremely expensive and often logistically unfeasible in low- and middle-income countries where the burden of micronutrient deficiencies is greatest. Therefore, there is a need to find innovative ways to identify populations at risk for micronutrient deficiencies to be able to provide targeted prevention and treatment strategies. Previous studies have linked household characteristics, such as poverty and dietary diversity, as well as the factors related to the surrounding environment, with poor micronutrient status. These multidimensional determinants of micronutrient status, though, have not been previously combined to create a composite measure (or index). The reliability with which such an index can identify populations vulnerable to 'hidden hunger' has also not been explored. We propose to address this research gap by taking a comprehensive approach in combining measures for poverty, living standards, and nutrition, in order to recognize the risk for 'hidden hunger' at the population level. This project will utilize secondary data from large cross-sectional surveys conducted in India, Bangladesh, and Mozambique and will further collect primary data on nutrition-specific measures, such as the dietary quality and quantity. The proposed dissertation work will offer a novel and practical tool to program-implementers and policy-makers to recognize populations at risk of vitamin and mineral deficiencies and to, ultimately, reduce the burden of 'hidden hunger' globally."
Effect of gestational age correction on association between length-for-age z-scores during infancy and cognitive development at 6 years of age,"['Perumal, Nandita']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Award'],1000.0,368461,"Physical growth and developmental trajectories in very early life have a long-lasting impact on health outcome much later in life. Babies that are born too soon, before the gestational age (GA) of 37 weeks (i.e. preterm birth), are smaller is size compared to babies that are born at >=37 weeks GA (i.e. term births). The rate at which preterm-born children grow physically and developmentally is therefore different than the rate at which term-born babies grow. This difference in growth rates due to variations in timing of birth is important to take into account when measuring growth in the first year of life. In clinical settings, it's standard practice to correct the postnatal age of an infant for the number of weeks they are born prior to term gestation when assessing their physical growth (i.e. use GA-corrected age); however in epidemiological research, this is rarely done. This means that previous studies that have shown that small size and poor physical growth in early childhood  is associated with an increased risk of poor cognitive and cardiovascular health outcomes in later life, may have generated biased estimates because they do not take into account variations in GA of newborns. The aim of the current study is to estimate and compare the magnitude and direction of the association between infant growth, when using GA-corrected age versus postnatal age, and cognitive ability in mid-childhood using data from the 2004 Pelotas (Brazil) Birth Cohort study. The overall goal of this research is to identify appropriate research methods for accurate measurement of early life growth trajectories, a modifiable factor, for better health outcomes throughout the life course."

In March 2024, this will include persons with a serious mental disorder as their sole underlying medical condition. This is called Track 2 MAID. We know that these are challenging cases. It can be difficult for healthcare providers to balance a persons' choice about their wish to die with the law when making a decision about whether an applicant is eligible for MAID. Healthcare providers find this emotionally difficult work. Many of our current systems are not yet structured in a way that supports this labour-intensive work. Importantly, we don't know a lot about what it is like for applicants and family to live through the process of contemplating, applying for, and receiving MAID under Track 2. In this project we aim to describe the experiences with Track 2 MAID of persons, family, and healthcare providers over a three year period. We will interview 30 applicants and 30 family members every two months. We will interview 30 healthcare providers every year for 3 years. We will interview key informants who are caring for persons with special circumstances (e.g., marginally housed) or who are involved in innovations to better understand what is good care for persons and family applying for, and/or receiving, MAID under Track 2. 

We want this knowledge to be shared throughout the project so every year we will hold a workshop for persons involved in making decisions about MAID Track 2 and give a presentation to the public about what we are learning. 

MAID for persons who are not imminently dying has been controversial. Behind the controversy there are real persons applying to end their lives and healthcare providers who have the difficult job of determining whether they are eligible to do so. Findings from this study will contribute to robust policies and high quality care for all those involved."
The Skin Cancer Burden from Occupational Sun Exposure in Canada,"['Peters, Cheryl E']",['N/A'],"['Cancer Prevention', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Skin Cancer', 'Sun Exposure']",2680.0,342022,"Ultraviolet radiation from the sun is the primary cause of skin cancer and we know that people who work outdoors are at particularly high risk of some specific types of skin cancer (called non-melanoma skin cancers or NMSC). The goal of this study was to estimate the current proportion of all NMSCs that can be attributed to sun exposure that occurs at work. 

We assigned jobs into categories of high, medium and low exposure to the sun based on the expected time spent outside at work. Values for the relative risk of these exposure levels were obtained from published studies and combined with data on the labour force, employment data, and survival probabilities for 1961 to 2001 to estimate the proportion of workers who were ever exposed to outdoor work.

Approximately 2.6 million workers ever worked outdoors since 1961, and 69% of them spent more than 3/4 of the day outdoors (high exposure category). Overall, we calculated that 6.3% of NMSCs could be attributed to occupational exposure (1.3% for women and 10.4% for men). 

We know that reducing sun exposure is important for preventing skin cancer, though this is difficult for outdoor workers to do in practice. By making changes that allow more shady work environments and providing protective clothing, workplaces could reduce a substantial proportion of skin cancer diagnoses in Canada."
Men's occupational cancer: opportunities for prevention,"['Peters, Cheryl E']",['N/A'],"['Cancer', ""Men'S Health"", 'Occupational Health', 'Public Health']",135000.0,339059,"Cancer is the leading cause of death in Canada, and the risk of cancer is higher among men than women. Exposure in the workplace to cancer-causing agents occurs mostly among men, which may explain some of this difference in risk. There are some types of cancer that occur much more commonly in men, and investigating if there are workplace-related reasons for this could help us to identify ways to reduce those exposures and prevent more men's cancers. The goals of this research program are to use existing Canadian studies to investigate the potential occupational causes of kidney, skin, and prostate cancers.

Many of the risk factors for kidney cancer (which affects more men than women) and prostate cancer (which only affects men) remain unclear, but both are presumed to be influenced by environmental exposures. Parts 1 and 2 of this program of research will use existing large Canadian databases to investigate the occupational causes of these important cancers, helping to identify ways to prevent them.

The leading cause of cancer in Canada is skin cancer, which we know is caused mainly by sun exposure. Men receive the majority of skin cancer diagnoses and this has been presumed to be at least partly because men work outdoors more than women, but a large scale investigation of occupational sun exposure and skin cancer has not been done in Canada before. Part 3 of this program will use an existing large study of 2.3 million Canadians, with information on their jobs, to examine this relationship and consider differences between men and women.

These studies address improving the health of workers, but also the general public. Exposure to the sun, diesel and gasoline exhausts in particular are problems for Canadians both at work and in their communities. Knowing how these exposures are impacting cancer rates, especially in men, will help us to reduce the risk of environmental cancer in the future."

While we know of the connection between lung cancer and air pollution, there is much less information regarding any possible relationship between air pollution and other types of cancer (e.g. kidney, bladder, pancreatic, brain, (female) breast, and prostate cancers, and leukemia). This is important because we do not know enough about what causes these particular cancers, which makes prevention difficult. All Canadians are exposed to at least some amount of air pollution, and so the impacts could influence a large number of people. In Canada, we are able to link air pollution data, large studies with information on where people live and whether or not they developed cancer. We are also able to examine information from health survey data with to determine whether people's lifestyle factors or behaviours relate to potential cancer risk (e.g. smoking). The goal of this research project is to learn more about the relationship between air pollution exposure and the risk of cancers besides lung cancer. We are also interested in differences in risk between men and women, and those living in urban (i.e., cities) areas versus suburban or rural areas. Our findings could inform policies intended to reduce the risk of cancer in Canada."

Exposure to occupational carcinogens alone leads to an estimated 9,700 to 10,400 new cancers each year in Canada. However, we do not know how the effects of these exposures might differ between men and women for two reasons. First, occupational studies have generally focused on male-dominated occupations and industries. As a result, women were not included in most of the available research studies until quite recently. Second, researchers did not anticipate that biological differences (physical size, hormonal differences, or how quickly a chemical can be cleared from the body) and sociocultural differences (which jobs and tasks we do, and which exposures were considered important) between men and women would have a large impact on occupational disease. Recent evidence tells us that both these factors (sex and gender) are very important to consider in occupational health research. In this timely, innovative project, we will develop tools to assess how sex and gender influence exposure to hazardous chemicals at work. Then, we will use these tools to examine differences in risk of three major occupational diseases (cancer, asthma, and dermatitis) between men and women in two existing Canadian disease surveillance studies. These novel results will help answer key questions about where men or women might be at different risk of disease from exposures they experience at work. We will generate new research questions that will contribute to efforts to reduce the burden of occupational disease among men and women in Canada."
Extreme weather events caused by climate change: Estimating the prevalence of at-risk workers,"['Peters, Cheryl E']","['Bhawra, Jasmin', 'Larsen, Kristian R', 'Nicolakakis, Nektaria', 'Villeneuve, Paul J']","['Climate Change', 'Extreme Weather Events', 'Occupational Health', 'Workers']",125000.0,485323,"Canada has been and is continuing to warm, on average, at double the magnitude compared to the world. Extreme weather events that are associated with this change in climate, such as wildfires, floods and storms, drought, and extreme heat, are becoming more frequent and severe, with immense impacts, as evidenced by the deadly heat dome over Western Canada and the record-breaking destructive flooding in BC, both occurring in 2021. Previous research has looked at the environmental consequences and community impacts of climate change and extreme weather events but has largely ignored the impacts on Canadian workers. Workers may be particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events because they may have to address the event as part of their work duties (e.g. during emergency response or disaster clean-up).
Additionally, they may have limited ability to protect themselves from  exposures related to the event (e.g. to reduce exposure to wildfire-associated air pollution, it is generally recommended that individuals stay indoors, but this might not be possible for outdoor workers).

In this project, we will estimate the number of Canadian workers impacted by extreme weather events, and examine how the numbers vary by province, age group, sex, and select socioeconomic variables. We will also strengthen connections between researchers and occupational health organizations in preparation for collective action on health protection in the face of more frequent extreme weather events due to climate change. This study will help fill a significant gap in our collective knowledge and provide a new equity-informed public health indicator to better understand climate change impacts on the health of Canadian workers."

The impact of demographic shifts are most profoundly felt at the local level, where health care is provided and where communities are tasked with responding to changing health needs.
This Planning & Dissemination Grant (PDG) builds on two existing projects in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, with the objective to develop a larger multi-provincial and multi-stakeholder project across the four Provinces in Atlantic Canada. This proposal describes the planning work required to develop a multi-provincial CIHR Project Scheme grant that combines the methodology for small-area rate variation of chronic diseases with that of small-area population forecasting, with the broad objective to forecast the burden of chronic disease for communities in Atlantic Canada. As prior projects have worked to develop the methodology, data structures, and analytic procedures, the project under development will focus on determining the population health impacts within neighbourhoods and communities via a patient-engaged process. The specific activities of this PDG will include the formation of a patient advisory group, hosting a multi-stakeholder planning meeting, preparation of a grant proposal, and submission to the CIHR Project Scheme."

This study aims to test: (1) Whether parents with higher behaviour problems throughout their childhood experience more distress (i.e., stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms) and engage in harsher parenting behaviours when they become a parent; (2) How do the child's irritability, the co-parent's adjustment, and the parents' relationship contribute to parental distress and harsh parenting; (3) Whether the risk is lower when the parents have higher income, used perinatal services, and receive social support, such as by grandparents. The participants come from two ongoing Canadian longitudinal studies initiated when participants were 5 months old and continuing up to young adulthood. We have information on participants' behavior problems from parents, teachers, and the youths themselves throughout development, and information about their early adulthood socioeconomic situation, relationship and parenthood status, and mental health. In this project, we will: (A) Follow-up the 2230 participants yearly to track new pregnancies and births; and (B) For the approximately 800 participants who are or will become parents, we will ask them and their co-parents about their adjustment, parenting behaviours, social and economic support, and we will ask for saliva samples to complete their genotyping. This project will set the stage for the first large-scale, 3-generation study in Canada. The results will help better understand the determinants of the quality of early family environments."

Approximately 70% of men's staggering health care costs (estimated at $36.9 billion annually) could be prevented if men improved their lifestyles (i.e., got active, ate better, and lost weight); however, few men engage in lifestyle change. The apparent reluctance of men to engage in healthy lifestyle programs may reflect the fact that men with excess weight tend to be less aware or concerned than women about their overweight status. Research has shown that programs situated in a sporting context, where men have a strong sense of affiliation as a fan, are effective and lead to high satisfaction among men. Hockey Fans in Training (Hockey FIT) is adapted from Football Fans in Training and our own HealtheSteps lifestyle prescription program. Hockey FIT is a 12-month (3-month active phase and 9-month maintenance phase) weight loss and healthy lifestyle program for middle-aged, overweight/obese male hockey fans, delivered by trained coaches in collaboration with teams in the Canadian Hockey League (CHL). Across the CHL, there are 52 teams spanning small to large urban centres, located throughout Canada. In the proposed study, 32 sites (affiliated with major junior hockey teams and local YMCA facilities) will be randomly assigned to either the intervention (Hockey FIT program) or comparator (wait-list control). At each site, 40 male hockey fans at-risk for chronic diseases will be recruited to take part in the study. Sites assigned to the comparator will offer the Hockey FIT program to their enrolled male hockey fans after 12 months. Through the Hockey FIT program, our study aims to promote weight loss, increase physical activity levels, and improve other health measures through a cost-effective solution that is acceptable and appealing to men who are overweight or obese. Indeed, findings from our pilot study indicate that Hockey FIT has the potential to achieve these goals."

Our multi-sectoral team (Collaborative) acknowledges this complexity of the factors involved in health disparity. Our goal is to co-create a physical activity and healthy eating program informed and guided by Indigenous Knowledge. Specifically, we will build on our  research collaborations to date and we will apply Indigenous practices and a western scientific method called community-based participatory action research to ensure our Collaborative benefits from lived experiences and research evidence; and that local community members from four Canadian rural and remote regions actively drive all aspects of the program based on their needs. We anticipate that our Collaborative will generate deeper understanding of Indigenous perceptions of health and disease in the context of their own unique social, economic, cultural, and environmental conditions; and build mutually beneficial partnerships in Indigenous communities to promote community-based skills development in health promotion and research.  Finally, we will determine the impact of this collaborative on health behaviors and outcomes in our partner communities as we create a sustainable program to improve health inequity in obesity and diabetes in Indigenous health."

Specifically, we will examine whether an emotionally inexpressive partner dampens his or her spouse's emotional sensitivity and responsiveness, with negative effects on overall marital quality. We will also investigate whether with increasing age, people are less likely to control their emotions by suppressing them, consistent with previous findings of more harmonious and fulfilling relationships in old adulthood. The aim of the present research is to provide a better understanding of the consequences of low emotional expressivity on marital quality in healthy individuals and patient populations.

The influence of dog ownership on physical activity in coronary heart disease patients.,"['Petter, Mark']",['N/A'],"['Coronary Heart Disease', 'Dog Ownership', 'Pet Attachment', 'Physical Activity']",105000.0,206191,"Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in Canada. Evidence suggests that physical fitness is the best predictor of mortality for CHD patients. Despite increased focus on interventions to promote physical activity (PA) in this population, CHD patients remain less physically active than their age-matched peers. It is therefore important that researchers identify relevant predictors of PA for CHD patients that can be targeted to improve these interventions. With this goal in mind, this study will examine the association between dog ownership and PA in CHD patients. Previous research with healthy adult and elderly populations has found that dog owners have higher levels of PA, and that characteristics of the dog (e.g., age, breed, size) and the dog/owner relationship (e.g., attachment, responsibility for the dog) moderate this association. Despite the finding that owning a dog decreases the risk of mortality for CHD patients, no research has examined the relationship between dog ownership and PA in this population. The proposed study will follow over 700 patients with CHD throughout the Atlantic Provinces. Participants will fill out questionnaires at baseline (following admittance to a hospital for a coronary event or enrollment in a CR program), 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. These questionnaires contain measures of dog ownership, characteristics of the dog, characteristics of the dog/owner relationship, and PA levels. Growth curve modeling will be used to examine whether dog ownership predicts change in PA levels over time. In addition, the role of dog characteristics, and characteristics of the dog/owner relationship will be examined. This project has the potential to improve the health of individuals with chronic disease, as it will be the first to examine the influence of dog ownership on PA levels in a chronic disease population. It may also inform the development of PA interventions with specialized components for CHD patients who own dogs."

Understanding the manifestation and perpetuation of dementia-related stigma and ageism through naturalistic conversation between racialized persons living with dementia and their care partner,"['Philip, George']",['N/A'],"['Ageism', 'Communication', 'Dementia', 'Older Adults', 'Racialized Groups', 'Stigma']",867.0,498008,"Background: Dementia-related stigma and ageism is known to transmit feelings of shame, embarrassment, and hopelessness. Such prejudices create barriers to help seeking behaviour, resulting in a delayed diagnosis, caregiver stress, and isolation. Moreover, dementia-related stigma and ageism is profound among racialized persons living with dementia (PLWD) and their care partners, as characteristics of race and culture are present. Despite this, there continue to be minimal efforts that address dementia-related stigma and ageism in Canada, particularly from a racialized perspective.
Aim: This study will explore the perceptions of dementia-related stigma and ageism and understand this phenomena through daily conversations between a racialized PLWD and their care partner.
Methods: The following research will be guided by two theoretical frameworks, 1) Corrigan's Model of Stigma and 2) Communication Predicament in Aging Model (CPA). A formal analysis of conversations between racialized Canadians living with dementia and their care partner will be performed, using conversation data from the Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging. A total of 22 dyads involving racialized PLWD (Black, Hispanic, South Asian, East Asian, Middle Eastern) and care partners will be analyzed. These dyads will be compared to a second group of 22 dyads involving white counterparts. A comparative analysis will be performed to understand differences and/or similarities of dementia-related sigma and ageism. Conventional content analysis will be used to identify themes related to dementia-related stigma and ageism. Themes will be applied to stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination from Corrigan's model, and will be informed by CPA.
Significance: This study is the first to examine dementia-related stigma and ageism in daily conversation between a racialized PLWD and their family care partner. It will provide a deeper understanding of how stigma and ageism is perpetuated in everyday language."
Cognitive organization of maltreatment memories as a key moderator of the association between child maltreatment and mental health in early adulthood,"['Philippe, Frederick L']","['Geoffroy, Marie-Claude', 'Guay, Stéphane', 'Hébert, Martine', 'Lecours, Serge']","['Adulthood', 'Autobiographical Memory', 'Child Maltreatment', 'Cognition', 'Memory', 'Mental Health']",359552.0,408353,"Child maltreatment (CM) refers to any act of commission or omission by a parent or other caregiver that results in intended or unintended harm such as physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, or neglect. One out of three adults have experienced CM in Canada. It is estimated to account for around a quarter of all mental disorders in adulthood and to cost more than 100 billion dollars each year. Despite these dramatic consequences, little has been done to better understand how CM can keep hindering mental health in adulthood, decades after the abuse. While memories for trauma (e.g., car accident) have been more investigated, CM memories have received much less attention. In addition, existing treatments for distressing memories in general have typically focused on increasing the processing of the distressing memory, but not on facilitating its integration into broader memory structure. Our past work shows that such integration of negative memories is key to mental health and prevents the negative memories to continuously hinder mental health over time. For the first time in memory or child maltreatment research, we seek to determine whether the level of integration in the memory system of accessible memories of past maltreatment could explain the association between CM and mental health in adulthood. We will follow adult CM victims and a control matched sample during three years. We will investigate whether increases or decreases of symptoms over time can be predicted by a weaker or greater integration of CM memories in the memory system, respectively. The present large-scale study is likely to lead to better prevention programs to victims of CM by devoting more attention to the cognitive organization of their CM memories, and to adaptation of existing treatments that could specifically target CM memories and their cognitive organization. Altogether, the expected findings should considerably contribute to reduce the dramatic economic cost of CM in the society."

SC interventions may reduce healthcare costs that accompanying co-morbid illness among PLWH. This research proposal is to develop a tailored SC intervention for HIV+ gay men to address social environment factors and deleterious health outcomes associated with tobacco use. Building upon our team's previous participatory action research experiences, we propose to develop and pilot test a SC intervention CoMUniTI QuitS (Collaboration for the development of an HIV+ gay Men's Uniquely Tailored Intervention to Quit Smoking).

New drug regimens have yielded significant health benefits for many PLWH, but those who smoke have increased risk for other serious complications. Significant knowledge gaps exist about the smoking patterns of PLWH and what might constitute effective targeted strategies for tobacco reduction (TR) among diverse sub-populations of PLWH. In British Columbia (BC), as in other settings, PLWH are a diverse group with complex psychosocial issues. However, few studies address tobacco related issues for PLWH who smoke or describe population specific TR interventions. Pathways to health care services for PLWH who smoke are also poorly understood, and consensus prevails among health care providers that TR efforts require focused attention. 
  The purpose of the proposed catalyst grant is to conduct an environmental scan to better understand the distribution of various sub-populations in assessing the feasibility of accessing and supporting the TR efforts of PLWH who smoke and to describe the tobacco related issues for men and women living with HIV and their health care providers.  Based on the findings drawn from our environmental scan, we will conduct qualitative interviews with a sample of men and women smokers with HIV to begin to understand some of the issues related to tobacco use that are influenced by the experience of HIV, gender differences and other social factors. 
  The proposed study will provide a foundation on which to build and foster future efforts of a new investigative community team. Collectively, the team is ideally positioned to address TR among PLWH and the resources made available through the catalyst grant will enable us to more fully engage with the issues and develop plans for implementing targeted interventions in this setting in the future."

Unlike the biological impact of time, social and individual circumstances (eg wealth, access to resources, social capital) are malleable via public policies. Limited research suggests their effect on health is entwined with sex/gender. Understanding social determinants and what health outcomes older adults view as central to ageing successfully despite chronic disease is essential to fostering health equality. For example, explaining the gender paradox in health (despite being poorer than men women live longer albeit reporting more suffering) could inform policies to equalize underlying social differentials. FUTUREGEN will examine current and future social circumstances that contribute to sex/gender inequalities in the health of older adults and their uneven access to care-giving/receiving. We will 1) develop research methods and measures that incorporate the complexity of individual roles and affiliations (eg within the category 'women' lies the variability of access to resources, autonomy at home and work, social support, early life adversity, etc.) 2) apply these novel methods to analysing comparable European and Canadian datasets that better embed cultural norms than does single country data & 3) obtain older people's definitions of healthy and successful ageing through qualitative research. All steps will be integrated in a back and forth manner and reviewed and challenged by an international expert Sounding Board. Our international research team brings awareness of the impact of different cultural milieux on health (ie a varied set of cultural eyes to interpret findings) as well as the intellectual and methodological richness of multiple disciplines (social sciences, economics, medicine).

As the number of people over the age of 65 is growing in Canada it is important to share evidence and information that may lead to new strategies to prevent and treat cognitive impairment as well as to support and care for those living with cognitive impairment and their caregivers. To ensure that this knowledge is shared in a meaningful way that is sustainable, equitable, diverse, accessible, just, and culturally safe, we will build a Hub designed as a distributed system that serves three main objectives: 1) provides expanded and equitable access to trustworthy information; 2) builds capacity among researchers and other groups in how to effectively share evidence and knowledge; and 3) builds community by creating opportunities for researchers, health care providers, people living with cognitive impairment and their caregivers, Indigenous communities, community organizations, and decision makers to interact and exchange evidence and ideas.

We are creating a team of academic researchers, people with dementia, and community partners who will work together, using the approach of ""participatory action research"", to meet two goals: (1) create a useful definition of ""social citizenship"" based on the experiences and opinions of people with dementia; and (2) show how this definition can provide practical guidance for communities to reduce stigma and promote social inclusion of people with dementia.
METHODS: An action group of people with dementia will be the centre of a team that includes academic researchers and community partners. To meet the first goal, the action group will direct the team on gathering in-depth information from different groups of people in the community who are living with dementia. Methods will include focus groups, workshops, interviews, and observation. The information will be analysed to create a framework defining the concept of social citizenship and identifying ways to respect citizenship. To meet the second goal, the research team will use this framework with direction from the action group to identify, apply, and assess strategies communities can use to support social citizenship for people living with dementia. Information about the process and impact of these strategies will be gathered and analysed.
IMPACT: Study outcomes will include a set of practical guidelines to provide direction for communities to reduce stigma and promote social inclusion of the growing numbers of people with dementia. We expect this to shape policy and decision-making at organizational and municipal levels. Including people with dementia in a full participatory role as co-researchers is groundbreaking in Canada, so we also expect study results to be influential for health and social care planning, and for further research."

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is known to manifest differently in subgroup populations, such as by ethnicity and biological sex, with worse treatment outcomes seen. Treatment goals and patient preferences for treatment may also vary by population group. To fully address health equity in the guidelines, we need to understand which differences exist, and also how implementation of the treatment recommendations may differ by population group. In this project, the student will assist in finalizing which populations from the PROGRESS-Plus categories are of priority for Canadian rheumatology practice and will be specifically discussed in the CRA RA Guidelines update. From there, clinical trial data will be analyzed for population-specific treatment effect. Enough data needs to be present in order to draw comprehensive and true conclusions. Differences in patient preferences (for either therapy, or outcome) of selected population groups will be examined from existing data sources. Collaboration with experts in the field and identified subgroup population patients will identify how treatment recommendations should be implemented in order to minimize differential outcome effects."

Our coordinator will reflect on the SK-IMNP's successes and stumbling blocks from the first year and share how the logic model framework will be adapted and expanded to include other provincial academic institutions and partners. We recognize that students across Saskatchewan have unique needs and look forward to discussing strategies for engagement and outreach with the other IMNP teams."
Planning epidemiologic studies using data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging to investigate associations of hearing with healthy and active aging,"['Pichora-Fuller, Margaret K']","['Lin, Frank', 'Mick, Paul']","['Active Aging', 'Dementia', 'Epidemiology', 'Healthy Aging', 'Hearing Loss', 'Inter-Professional Practice', 'Memory', 'Older Adults', 'Prevention', 'Social Isolation']",19761.0,308048,"Hearing loss increases with age, affecting about half of those 75 years or older. It makes communication difficult and people often cope by withdrawing from social interaction and avoiding participation in group activities. Recent evidence indicates that hearing loss is related to future dementia. In general, people with hearing loss have poorer mental and physical health compared to peers with good hearing; e.g., older adults with hearing loss have more falls than those with good hearing. Although the association of hearing loss with dementia and other health conditions is known, the reasons are not yet known. The connection may be due to common biological changes. Ongoing mental strain from listening with a hearing loss may trigger changes in the brain. Alternatively, hearing loss may be associated with other health conditions because it increases risk of social isolation which in turn can jeopardize mental and physical health. We must learn more about why there is a connection between hearing loss and risks for age-related declines in various health conditions. Such new knowledge will guide new approaches to hearing health care that could have significant long-term benefits by preventing or slowing declines in other health conditions. We propose a 2.5-day meeting to plan how to use the data from the first three-year wave of the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging (CLSA) to discover more about the associations of hearing with healthy and active aging. By 2015, data collected at 11 CLSA testing sites across Canada will be ready for analysis, including an extensive set of hearing, vision, cognitive, social, and physical health measures from 30,000 Canadians. Scientific and clinical experts in hearing, vision, cognition, language, medicine, health care and epidemiology, along with representatives from consumer, professional and industrial stakeholder groups will meet to plan the questions and analyses for a CIHR operating grant to be submitted in 2014."
Investigation of the Links between Stigma Related to Aging and Hearing Loss: Effects on Social Interaction and Health Behaviours,"['Pichora-Fuller, Margaret K', 'Chasteen, Alison']","['Singh, Gurjit', 'Smith, Sherri L']","['Communication', 'Healthy Aging', 'Hearing', 'Social Interaction', 'Stereotypes', 'Stigma']",49988.0,203897,"Hearing loss due to aging begins after the age of 40 years and its prevalence increases with age. It is one of the top three chronic disabilities. From the time when people first notice hearing problems, it often takes 10 to 20 years before they seek diagnosis and rehabilitation, with the average age of first time hearing aid users being about 70 years. Unfortunately, even after hearing aids are purchased, many people do not wear them. Over the last two decades, although engineers have made impressive advances in miniaturizing and improving hearing aid technology, people are still very reluctant to pursue solutions for hearing problems and they continue to have much difficulty adjusting to hearing loss as a chronic health condition. One likely reason for these delays in treatment is that people think of hearing aids as a sign of aging and there is stigma associated with both old age and hearing loss. Thus, although hearing loss can result in reduced communication and social interaction, it seems that the perceived social cost of wearing a hearing aid is a major deterrent to solving hearing problems. In this project we will investigate the stigma associated with aging and the stigma associated with hearing loss to learn more about how they are linked. This new knowledge at the intersection of the disciplines of social psychology and audiology should lead to the development of new therapies for older adults with hearing loss. Such new therapies will be implementable by audiologists and guided by health psychology practices that have been successful in reducing the negative consequences of stigma to facilitate the individual's more rapid and more successful adjustment to change and the adoption of new health behaviours."

Infectious diseases of HCV and HIV are serious public health concerns in Canada, and the integration of care for vulnerable populations affected by these infections is a major policy goal. The target population experiences stigma, isolation, limited support, homelessness, poverty, social marginalization, and barriers to treatment access. Not many IDUs have successfully accessed treatment for HCV and they continue to be an underserved vulnerable population. Non-traditional health care approaches to treating people with HCV who use drugs and who have co-infection with HIV and/or concurrent mental illness can be successful with regards to treatment delivery, and managing side effects. The study will utilize quantitative and qualitative data collected from IDUs in the peer-based intervention and IDUs not a part of the intervention but receiving primary care at partnering health centers. A theoretical behavioural framework will guide the analysis of the behavioural, structural and epidemiological aspects of infectious disease risk behaviours and prevention including co-infection HCV/HIV, treatment readiness, barriers to treatment, integration of care, substance use, mental illness, risk reduction strategies, stigma, social support, homelessness, poverty, and social marginalization.

Dr. William Pickett is a PhD epidemiologist appointed at the Full Professor level in the Department of Community Health and Epidemiology at Queen's.  Over the last 15 years, he has developed a collaborative program of applied research with competitive funding support from major peer-review agencies, including CIHR. 

The research program that is proposed here includes three main themes: (1) adolescent health and its determinants in vulnerable populations of children; (2) pediatric health in agricultural and rural populations; (3) emergency medicine and injury control research. A major goal articulated here is to build a collaborative program of epidemiological and associated health policy research centred at Queen's, with specific focus on leading health issues in vulnerable populations of children.  This Research Chair will allow Dr. Pickett to provide more concentrated leadership to this new initiative.    

Findings from the research program will: 1) describe the magnitude of specific health problems, and hence assist with the establishment of societal priorities for prevention and treatment; 2) identify underlying causes and determinants of poor health outcomes in vulnerable populations, which again assists in prevention initiatives such as the generation of health policy solutions; 3) inform the development of evidence-based guidelines for patient care."

Some populations are more vulnerable to injury than others.  Agricultural populations experience very high rates of injury, yet evidence surrounding underlying causes of agricultural injury remains limited. As part of an organized and long-term effort to understand more about the causes of agricultural injuries in Canada, in 2005 CIHR funded our research team to develop a cohort of farm families in Saskatchewan.  Phase 1 of this initiative was highly successful. The theoretical base for this study was population health theory; hence much of this research focuses on determinants of injury on farms. Because of our unique sampling frame and the breadth of our baseline survey, additional analyses allowed our group to understand other risk factors for injury, as well as other contributors to health in farm populations. The current grant application is for Phase 2 of this cohort study. The primary focus is to further understanding about physical, economic, and cultural environments and their effects on injury rates in agricultural populations.  We propose to follow our general cohort of 2,390 farms (5,502 people) for an additional 3 years.  We also propose an expanded focus on injuries experienced by members of vulnerable populations through the establishment of a child and young worker cohort.  Data from the two cohorts will also permit us to study potential causes of other health outcomes specific to agricultural populations, as well as their prevention. This project addresses multiple CIHR research priorities, and involves a strong research team. Our focus on vulnerable subgroups in the agricultural sector is timely. Our long-term goal is to provide useful evidence for this important segment of Canada's rural population."

We will explore whether features of the built environment contribute to obesity and injuries in Canadian children. 

As part of an organized effort to collect health data on children in 45 countries, we conduct a survey every 4 years in grade 6-10 Canadian youth.  In 2004, CIHR funded us to perform in-depth analyses of this Canadian survey, and to develop a follow-up survey of Ontario students. This research focused on risk-taking and injury.  Additional analyses allowed us to understand other aspects of child health.  

The focus of our renewal grant is the ""built environment"" and its effects on the physical health of children.  The built environment refers to physical features of the environment such as the presence and condition of parks, walking paths, school facilities, and safe homes. We contend that, if we make changes to the built environment, we can reduce injuries and obesity in young Canadians.    

In 2009-10, we will survey 90,000 Canadian children.  It is possible to link these survey data with public information describing school, neighbourhood and home environments.  Using these sources, we will study the effects of the built environment on obesity and injury. We will also study whether social, behavioural and geographic factors influence the ability of the built environment to impact obesity and injury.  Social factors will include wealth, behavioural norms, and cohesion within schools and neighbourhoods.  Behavioural factors will include diet, physical inactivity, and risk-taking. Geographic factors will include the province, community size, and climate of the communities in which youth live.  

Our long-term goal is to inform health policies and prevention strategies for obesity and injury. CIHR suggests that both are leading research priorities, as are studies of the built environment.  Study of these relationships will lead to novel research for Canadian youth."

Using survey data and young people's own stories, we want to understand: (1) how individual behaviours and social processes (such as use of social media, available peer and adult supports, and risk-taking) contribute to mental health inequalities between adolescent boys and girls; (2) how differences in mental health between boys and girls are shaped by gendered differences in their social backgrounds.  We will bring together new analyses of health survey data with information from a series of interviews with young Canadians. Integration of all study findings will provide new evidence about factors that effect mental health among groups of adolescents, inform interventions, and enrich the evidence base for health policy. This project is especially timely because the mental health of Canadian adolescents, as well as gender-based inequalities, have emerged as two very pressing social challenges in our country."

Some turn to risk-taking to cope with adversity. Others engage for social reasons, or to gain acceptance by peers. Still others do so in response to new-found freedoms from adults.  Most adolescent risk-taking is innocuous, but some is hazardous. Further, subgroups of adolescents, including those in at-risk groups, may experience risk-taking and its consequences in inequitable manners. Historical declines in traditional risk behaviours (e.g., smoking) are celebrated as public health triumphs. Yet, panels of young Canadians have told us emphatically that risk-taking isn't decreasing but is transitioning. This begs the question - how is risk-taking changing, and do contemporary risks have similar health consequences?  And from a public health perspective, are there simple things that can be done to enhance the surveillance of emergent risks nationally?  Moreover, can we identify ""equity-deserving"" groups, with a specific emphasis on gendered experiences, who may be discriminated against in terms of exposure, susceptibility, and consequences to risk taking? For the first time, we will bring together the leadership of two major Canadian adolescent health surveys to work cooperatively capitalizing on existing infrastructure. We will enlist the expertise of young Canadians to relate how risk-taking occurs contemporarily and to share their perceptions of its purposes, harms and potential benefits. We will derive and evaluate new indicators of risk-taking along with existing traditional indicators with the ultimate goal of enhancing surveillance nationally. We know of no other research group in Canada who can achieve this in terms of speed and efficiency. By bringing together our two programs with this common aim, this project will be a first-of-its-kind, efficient and sensible investment for public health in Canada."

These three meetings will involve relevant multidisciplinary researchers and stakeholders: 
•CIHR domain: focus on child and youth injury prevention, promotion and protection, including policy enforcement (this funding application); 
•SSHRC domain: focus on injury prevention behaviour and education, including social marketing (Connection grant) 
•NSERC domain: focus on engineering and environment aspects of injury prevention (Engage grant) 
The aim of these meetings is to determine sectoral priorities for the proposed InjurySafetyNet NCE to inform a subsequent Summit Meeting of key participants from the three initial planning meetings to further develop the InjurySafetyNet NCE proposal. In this one-day meeting, 21 stakeholders from academia, non-government organizations and government who focus on infant, child and youth injuries from a health perspective will meet in Montreal.

During the height of the pandemic, public health leaders and governments required Canadians to stay-at-home and to maintain 6 feet apart if, and when, they were out. These policies, and the response to them, undoubtedly saved lives. We are unsure however, of how some COVID-19 policies may have affected other health outcomes. A recent Children First Canada report called, ""Raising Canada 2020"" reported that it is unknown if and how COVID-19 policies have had an effect on children and youth in terms of unintentional injury. Preventable injury is the number one threat to children and youth in Canada. Despite this, we do not have data on the number of children and youth affected by unintentional injury during the COVID-19 restrictions.

As such, stroke can cause both, physical and cognitive challenges for people. In fact, close to 50% people with stroke will have memory problems. The most important risk factor for stroke is high blood pressure. Risk factors such as high blood pressure can be prevented or reversed through lifestyle changes, and not only with medications. Lifestyle changes (such as physical activity, healthy nutrition, better stress management, positive social connections, less substance use and good quality sleep) can individually or in combination help people form new habits to maintain healthy behaviours and improve wellness and quality of life, but more so, they can have better brain health. Although lifestyle changes can lower high blood pressure, little is known about how best to design lifestyle interventions (habit changes) and how this can work for different people (for example, men and women). Our goal is to learn exactly that; how, why and for whom lifestyle interventions work or don't work and in which way. A review of the prior studies will be done with a librarian to learn more about lifestyle interventions that can be proposed to clinicians to optimize care for patients with high blood pressure, and subsequently prevent stroke or stroke related memory decline. The findings will help us design lifestyle interventions to lower high blood pressure (and in turn, risk of stroke) in a way that is helpful and appropriate for different people and in different environments, and can be used in the clinic, at home, with families or friends."
The Association Between Residential Eviction and Syringe Sharing among a Prospective Cohort of Street-involved Youth,"['Pilarinos, Andreas']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2500.0,368404,"Sharing needles is associated with the spread of diseases including HIV. Current research shows that youth who are homeless are more likely to share needles. Unfortunately, most studies have focused on homeless youth and few have looked at whether youth who have been evicted are also more likely to share needles. In this study, we wanted to understand whether there was a relationship between eviction and sharing needles. 

This research is based on the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS) in Vancouver, Canada between June 2007 to May 2014. Street-involved youth between the ages of 14 - 26 who use hard drugs participate in the ARYS cohort. Logistic regression statistical techniques were used to measure the association between eviction and needle sharing among ARYS participants while adjusting for other factors.

The results of this study are that there is an elevated level of needle sharing among youth who report being evicted. This provides two possible scenarios: the first is that youth are sharing needles and then being evicted, or the second is that youth are being evicted and then sharing needles. Either of these options points to the need for stable housing for youth in order prevent needle sharing and the spreading of HIV.

High levels of needle sharing among the youth who report eviction are concerning. While needle sharing in adult population has decreased over time, research shows that youth still share needles at high levels. Here, we highlight the importance of access to housing options that meet youth where they are at in life. Additionally, housing supports - like case planning, social work, and cleaning support - should also be provided to prevent eviction among street-involved youth."
Bridging the Gap Between Infant Mental Health and Infant Health: Bringing Attachment Theory into the Infant Acute Pain Context,"['Pillai Riddell, Rebecca Rita E']","['Flora, David B', 'Moran, Gregory A']","['Attachment', 'Developmental Trajectories', 'Infant Acute Pain Behaviour', 'Longitudinal Growth Modeling', 'Parental Soothing Behaviour']",312203.0,211554,"Over forty years of research has demonstrated that insecure infant attachments (to parents) predict poor health outcomes across the lifespan, such as being diagnosed with serious psychiatric illnesses or chronic pain conditions.  Being able to help lessen the impact of insecure infant attachments before they are set, would have a high potential for significantly impacting the health of Canadians. This grant aims to take the first step in this process by generating knowledge regarding how parents and infants interact over the first year of life during immunizations.  Immunization pain triggers infant attachment behaviours because it triggers infants sense of danger and thus, the infants' need for parent.  Caregivers and infants who have taken part in an ongoing research project will be invited to participate in the current study after infants attend their 12-month immunization appointments. During the original study, immunization procedures at 2, 4, 6 and 12 months were videotaped to capture infant pain-related behaviour as well as the way they
interacted with their caregiver; these data will be utilized in the current analyses. The current study will then invite these caregiver-infant dyads to take part in a wellknown attachment assessment procedure called the Strange Situation Paradigm. By examining how an infant's relationship with his or her caregiver is related to how an infant reacts when in pain, this project will help us better understand how insecure infants act in a commonly occuring stressful situation. Ultimately, it is hoped that information created in this grant will be able to be used by health professionals, in the immunization context, to help lessen the occurence of insecure attachments and improve the health of Canadians at all ages."

Sex and Gender-related Differences in Access to Care for Premature ACS: Does the Health Care System Matter?,"['Pilote, Louise', 'Dreyer, Rachel P']","['Raparelli, Valeria']","['Access To Care', 'Acute Coronary Syndrome', 'Cardiovaslucar', 'Epidemiology', 'Gender', 'Health Care System', 'Longitudinal Design', 'Outcomes', 'Sex', 'Young Population']",309826.0,382102,"Women still struggle to achieve high-quality equitable cardiovascular care. Recently, there has been growing attention to young women (=55 years) with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), who experience worse recoveries and higher mortality compared with similar aged men. Moreover, the rising incidence of ACS in young is of immediate concern. Despite recent advancements in understanding premature ACS outcomes, important questions remain. Access to high-quality care which may differ across health care systems (private/public) could explain the suboptimal care and poorer outcomes in young women post-ACS. Gender-related factors (e.g. socioeconomic status) have been associated with poorer access to timely cardiac procedures among women, independent of sex. The impact of sex and gender on access to care along the continuum of care for premature ACS, including how it varies across health care systems requires further investigation. Accordingly, our objective is to examine sex differences in the trajectory of access to care from pre-ACS to post-ACS setting among young patients and whether gender-related factors are associated with access to care. We hypothesize that female sex and gender-related factors traditionally ascribed to women are associated with poorer access to care in young and the magnitude of such disparities depends on health care system. To test this, we will merge data on two largest prospective cohorts of young patients with premature ACS to date: GENESIS-PRAXY and VIRGO studies. A sex and gender-based approach to address the unmet health care needs of premature ACS is much needed. It will help identify factors for targeted interventions aimed at improving women's access to high-quality health care. Merging these cohorts across 4 countries (US, Canada, Spain, Switzerland) will provide an opportunity for high-impact international research on sex and gender differences on access to care and for accessing the generalizability of results across health care systems."

Few studies have assessed the effect of gender on health. Thus, the GENESIS PRAXY team, lead by Dr. Louise Pilote, found validated questionnaires to measure aspects of gender in a cohort of young people with acute coronary syndrome. Subsequently, they created a ""Gender Index"" offering a current and pragmatic option to measure gender within this population. We propose a grant planning meeting bringing an international, multidisciplinary team to Montreal to identify existing gender-related measures and composite scores, identify cohort studies for incorporating gender measurement and develop standard statistical methods to incorporate gender measurement(s) in health research. The goal of the planning meeting is to address several issues that have been raised since the publication of the article by the GENESIS PRAXY Team entitled ""Sex versus gender-related characteristics: which predicts outcome after acute coronary syndrome in the young?"" (1) Moreover, a meeting will solidify collaborations by establishing an international multidisciplinary team aiming at assessing the impact of gender on health status, we will be poised to launch international studies. There currently is a great momentum for the development of valid instruments that will allow the measurement of the impact of gender and lead to the consideration of gender in enhancing access to care and health outcomes for both men and women.

Estimating Sex and Gender Differences in Heat Vulnerability in Montreal,"['Pilote, Louise']","['Ezzati, Majid', 'Norris, Colleen M', 'Zhou, Yusheng']","['Bayesian Modeling', 'Environmental Health', 'Gender Differences', 'Heat Vulnerability', 'Hierarchical Modeling', 'Sex Differences', 'Vulnerability Assessment']",125000.0,485345,"Adverse health outcomes related to heat exposure are a growing public health concern. While everyone is susceptible to heat, certain populations are more vulnerable to its effects. Recently, research has turned to constructing heat vulnerability indices (HVI) to assess heat risk from a vulnerability perspective. These indices combine information on heat exposure and population vulnerability to map areas of highest risk and prioritize mitigation efforts. However, previous HVIs have largely overlooked the impact of sex and gender on heat vulnerability.

Our proposed project aims to address this gap in knowledge by constructing a sex and gender-informed HVI using a hierarchical spatial Bayesian model for the urban area of Montreal. The study will assess the effect modification of the HVI on the association between heat and mortality, explore any sex differences in the results obtained from the HVI analysis and determine the relative importance of gender-related indicators in assessing heat risk. We will consider a wide range of structural, social, and environmental determinants of health, including household status, income, and green spaces.

The proposed research has significant public health implications, as it will inform policy and interventions to reduce the risk of adverse health outcomes related to heat exposure, particularly for vulnerable populations. By identifying the sex and gender differences in heat vulnerability, we will provide a more nuanced understanding of the differential effects of heat exposure on men and women. Furthermore, by using a hierarchical spatial Bayesian model, we will overcome some of the limitations of previous HVIs that have used principal component analysis, such as the inability to account for hierarchical structures and gender-specific indicators."

Sociodemographic data collected at the individual level, paired with interventions to meet social needs when identified, could address this problem. Further, robust sociodemographic data linked to electronic medical records (EMRs) can support quality improvement and new care pathways at the organizational level, planning and resource allocation at the system level, and advance research on health inequities. The SPARK Study is a cluster randomized controlled trial that will rigorously evaluate a ""modest"" versus ""intensive"" intervention to help address poverty when identified. While the primary outcome of this intervention is change in income attributable to the poverty intervention, we will capture data on additional impacts, including linkage to community resources, psychological stress and quality of life. To prepare for the trial, we will develop and validate a standard tool for sociodemographic data collection and social need identification, building on our previous research. We will also pilot test our tool, EMR integration, recruitment processes and study instruments before launching the full trial. Finally, we will collect qualitative data alongside the trial to evaluate implementation and better understand how the intervention to address poverty impacts on participants.

When people are engaged in decent work, it provides an adequate income, helps individuals develop their social connections, builds self-confidence and has a positive impact on health. Previous studies have found that unemployment rates in people living with HIV (PHAs) are higher than the general population for numerous reasons, including poorer health status, issues around access to benefits, and stigma faced in the workplace. Other studies have found that a sizable proportion of unemployed PHAs would want to reenter work if it left them better off, and we estimate over 20,000 Canadian PHAs may be in this category. Research by members of our team have identified that health and well-being typically improves for PHAs who engage in employment. This community based research (CBR) draws on the years of experience of Employment ACTion, an AIDS Service Organizations (ASO) in Toronto that has assisted hundreds of PHAs explore employment, Realize, a national non-profit that focuses on rehabilitation, and the expertise of frontline health providers and academics. We aim to catalyze a new partnership around employment as a social determinant of health for PHAs and carry out community based research to support a future employment intervention study. This will result in a new network of individuals and organizations that are interested in addressing employment outcomes for PHAs in Canada. Our project will support future community based research in this area, including the intervention study that is envisioned. Finally, this work will also provide the foundation for new curriculum for health providers on workplace rights for PHAs, supporting workplace accommodation and connecting PHAs with community resources if they are interested in reentering employment."

Notably, Indigenous women in Canada are four times more likely to experience IPV than non-Indigenous women. These inequities among Indigenous women and children need to be understood within a broad context of Canadian colonization and the intergenerational effects of the collective traumas experienced by previous generations of families and communities. The negative impacts of IPV for women and their children have been well documented. Women survivors of IPV are at elevated risk for a variety of physical and psychological problems which may also impact their parenting. Children exposed to IPV are 5 to 7 times more likely to experience a wide variety of emotional and behavioral problems in the short term and over their lifetime, compared to unexposed children. They are also at greater risk of continuing the cycle of violence later in adulthood than children who have not been exposed. Effective interventions are urgently needed; unfortunately, many existing programs were not designed to meet the needs of Indigenous mothers and their children. When used without the proper cultural contexts and adaptations, interventions can inadvertently exacerbate existing traumas and continue the histories of Canadian colonialism and health inequity among Indigenous populations. Our team combines the necessary expertise of Indigenous knowledge keepers and experienced researchers to address this problem. Our goal is to conduct a feasibility study of an evidence-based intervention designed specifically to meet the needs of Indigenous mothers and their children who have experienced IPV using a two-eyed seeing approach.

This research will analyze how travel-related risks have been measured and addressed across global, national and sub-national settings during the pandemic. Travel has been deeply implicated in the spread and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite initial recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO) against restricting international traffic, many countries adopted travel measures in attempt to slow or prevent the international spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its variants. The resulting chaotic and inequitable disruptions to global mobility represented a significant departure from the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) - an international legally binding treaty with the core purpose of coordinating international responses to global public health emergencies. These prolonged, uncoordinated approaches to travel-related risks resulted in negative public health, social and economic consequences. At the same time, new evidence shows that travel measures implemented under certain conditions can advance public health goals. The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed serious gaps in the risk governance mechanisms required for effective collective action in response to public health emergencies of international concern (PHEICs). This research recognizes an urgent and critical opportunity to study gaps in travel-related risk governance during the pandemic to build better prepared public health systems at sub-national, national and global levels.

This is especially true for children since they spend most of their time in their communities. What is more, these changes in how kids engage in their environments (i.e., playing more outside) can help set a healthy base for the rest of their lives. As adults, we have the responsibility to design neighbourhoods that keep kids healthy. Neighbourhoods are complicated but understanding how all the pieces of their design interact and affect child health can help city planners and engineers figure out where, when, and how to make change. This project will focus on one of the most common issues in kids, mental health, and examine how neighbourhood environments help or hinder mental health in children. What makes this project unique is that it has followed over 3,200 kids since birth (now age 14). This project lets us follow how mental health has changed over time using detailed questionnaires completed by kids and moms. It also has data on important factors like income, family health history, and other behaviours (i.e., physical activity). Using postal codes for moms and kids, I will link neighbourhood information on parks, streets, and air pollution (among others) to child health data collected over the last 14 years. Using these combined data sets I aim to understand how environment affects child mental health and how the pieces of the environment affect each other. Understanding the whole picture will help me create a score for each neighbourhood. I will then map those scores across Alberta neighbourhoods and look at how equally healthy environments are distributed. A total score can help show planners and engineers, who are usually not involved in health care, how their designs can affect health or even create divisions in health. It will also give them direction on where they can make change to reduce unequal distribution and improve health for everyone."

Indigenous Cree youth face additional challenges to accessing services due to their remote setting. The Cree also face a legacy of colonial persecution, which has disconnected them from traditional healing methods and culturally relevant forms of support. A pan-Canadian initiative is currently underway to improve access to mental health services across the country, and the Cree community of Mistissini has been selected as one of the sites where new strategies will be developed and tested. This represents a unique opportunity to evaluate new mental health strategies as they are being rolled out. It also means there is a crucial need for youth input to ensure that these strategies address their needs and concerns. My research aims to generate a better understanding of how Cree youth think about mental illness, the reasons they decide to access or avoid mental health services, and their reactions as new strategies are taking place. I will work with Cree youth as equals throughout the research process, empowering them to think critically about the mental health challenges and resources in their community.

Ce guide suggère aux établissements de créer leur propre politique organisationnelle sur les niveaux de soins. 

Au Centre intégré de santé et de services sociaux de Chaudière-Appalaches (CISSS-CA), un comité de travail sur l'amélioration des décisions de soins en respect des valeurs et des préférences a été créé et aura pour premier mandat de créer une politique organisationnelle sur la pratique de niveaux de soins pour l'établissement. Avec ce mandat, le CISSS-CA veut se positionner en tant que chef de file québécois concernant les niveaux de soins. Ce sujet est d'actualité est d'une grande importance dans un contexte où la population est vieillissante et où les technologies permettent de maintenir des patients en vie, sans  garantie sur leur qualité de vie. 

La candidate veut soutenir l'élaboration de cette politique organisationnelle grâce aux connaissances qu'elle a acquises lors de la réalisation de projets de recherche au CISSS-CA.  Les résultats attendus de sa dernière phase de collecte de données au doctorat répondent aux besoins du comité de travail. Cette dernière phase de collecte vise à explorer les enjeux et les facteurs facilitant, selon des médecins spécialistes et généralistes, d'amorcer une discussion sur les niveaux de soins avec les patients admis à l'hôpital qui ont un mauvais pronostic.

Toward Equity- and Evidence-Informed Policy and Practice in Global Health Research,"['Plamondon, Katrina M']","['Elliott, Susan J', 'Graham, Ian D', 'Nixon, Stephanie A']","['Equity Action', 'Health Equity', 'Health Research Systems', 'Impact', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Training']",100000.0,442942,"The trajectories of people's lives are often shaped by things that fall outside of their control, having more to do with unearned disadvantages than with their own behaviours or biology. Despite solid evidence and practical policy solutions, systematic differences in health and health outcomes persist both within and between countries. Evidence shows the distribution of power, resources, and wealth along social gradients are causes of these inequities. Many people working in health and health research, and particularly in global health, describe their work as reducing health inequities or advancing health equity; but research shows their efforts, both in what and how they do global health research, does not integrate equity considerations.

This knowledge translation science project will support people within the global health research community in Canada to align their equity intentions with knowledge and action. By supporting people to integrate evidence-informed strategies and principles, efforts to improve population health can move toward more productive health equity action that focuses on addressing the causes, rather than symptoms, of inequities. The project team brings together leaders in global health research and knowledge translation, building upon a strong foundation of previous work and leveraging the continued relationships and knowledge translation efforts across well- established networks."

The differences are so ingrained that virtually any health outcome varies according to social gradients. These are referred to collectively as health inequities.

A person born in the lowest income countries of the world is expected to live half as long as a person born in the highest income countries. The health of people living in high-income countries is also unequal, shaped by social and economic inequities and the legacies of colonization. Even with decades of global pledges for worldwide efforts to reduce inequities, they persist. These inequities pose profound social and economic costs across societies.

Global health research (GHR) aims to reduce these inequities. Canadian investments in GHR are growing, with a direct focus on advancing equity as one of the most important things that can be done to improve health worldwide. While it is promising to have a vision for advancing equity, actually doing so requires specific knowledge and skills. Saying equity matters is not a guarantee that the right kinds of action follow. Making a difference about the world's health inequities in or through GHR requires 'walking the talk'. Evidence shows a gap between what is said and what is actually done in GHR. While GHR may be promising for reducing inequities and promoting health worldwide, it also poses the risk of reinforcing inequities.

Working alongside people who will use results, this research project will test the capacity-building effects of a training intervention specifically designed to move equity intentions into action. This project involves three objectives: (1) to examine how equity is operationalized in Canada's GHR ecosystem; (2) to evaluate the capacity building impacts of an intervention for advancing equity in Canada's GHR ecosystem; and (3) to build consensus on standards for excellence in practicing equity. This research will generate new resources, tools, and knowledge needed to infuse Canada's GHR ecosystem with the capacity and leadership needed to advance health equity."

Vaccine nationalism involves (mostly rich) countries taking steps to protect their own citizens' access to vaccines. Vaccines remain scarce because of many factors that limit global capacity to manufacture and distribute enough to reach every person who needs it. Many wealthy countries talk about their desire to end the pandemic as soon as possible, but their efforts to protect their own populations added to this scarcity-leaving poorer countries behind. The mismatch between what wealthy countries say they stand for and what they actually do is contributing to even more unfair working and living conditions for the world's poorest populations. This project will bring experts in equity, ethics, policy, and practice together to understand how we can generate fairer global policy solutions that balance the interests and needs of populations around the world. Rather than leaving some people behind, this project will generate learning tools and policy recommendations that can support policy and practice responses that enable all people to move forward to a global pandemic recovery, together.

We have found that: 1) income-related health inequalities are widespread in all cities we considered; 2) however, income-related health inequalities also vary considerably between them; 3) these between city differences are primarily driven by the health outcomes of poor neighbourhoods not rich; and 4) over time, inequalities overall have tended to stay the same or become worse. In the years to come, addressing health inequalities in Canada's cities is likely going to require making investments and policy choices that target and improve the health of poor neighbourhoods."

This leads to compromises in defining cohorts and measures of risk, which can introduce bias. Further, processes that occur during pregnancy are either poorly recorded (e.g., maternal weight gain) or unobserved (e.g., fetal growth). Further, observational studies record data on these processes only at a few time points (sometimes only at birth). Finally, most research to date has not appropriately considered the role of fetal growth and maternal weight gain as mediating variables. I intend to apply conceptual and statistical tools for causal inference to the study of maternal exposures and pregnancy outcomes, incorporating recent research on methods dealing with mediation to account for the potential mediating effects of fetal growth, maternal weight gain, and preterm birth.My second research area is pharmacoepidemiology. I am the methods lead for the Canadian Network for Observational Drug Effect Studies (CNODES), funded to conduct rapid-response studies of drug safety in administrative databases. Such research is limited due to confounding, especially by indication. My research involves development and implementation of methods for targeted semiparametric inference to avoid this. Methods for causal inference typically require estimates of the propensity score to account for measured confounding; in my ongoing research I am developing and evaluating approaches to model the propensity score for the most efficient causal inference for exposure-outcome associations. CNODES is an ideal environment for methods development. The study data serve as a platform for methods work, and methodological developments produced by my research team can be quickly integrated into the ongoing drug safety projects.I have published 95 papers in the past five years, and my H-index is 49 per Scopus. My research has been published in top journals and many have been recognized as fundamental contributions. My method for correcting gestational age data in has been implemented in Canadian, Ontario, and French references for birth weight for gestational age. My methods have been used in work that has had public health impact on breastfeeding, and on socioeconomic pathways to preterm birth, and on drug regulation. My research team, coupled with program experts Kramer, Suissa, Tagalakis, Bodnar, Moodie, and Ernst, provide substantive and methodological expertise to ensure the success of this research program.Most of the ongoing research projects in my research team are being led by trainees, and all of them provide training opportunities. My research team involves several students and fellows who work in a collaborative environment, and all trainees have access to relevant journal clubs and working groups.These projects and my collaborative work allow me to be active in development of statistical methods and implementation of methods of direct relevance to epidemiologic and other researchers, and in knowledge translation from methods to substantive research. This work has both long-term impact in terms of improving the methodological quality of health research, and direct impact when my collaborative work is used to drive changes in health care."

Because each province differs from the others, the United States, and the United Kingdom, the best research strategies (as well as the overall safety and effectiveness of drugs) can be very different as well. In 2022, these differences are larger than ever thanks to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic substantially altering the types of drugs patients start taking and whether they attend in-person office visits with their providers. Currently, however, there are very few ways to understand, document, and communicate these differences. This research project aims to develop new ways for researchers to understand, interpret, and communicate differences in how parts of networks like CNODES (or other studies involving multiple populations) decide which patients receive what treatment, differences in rates of important risk factors and health outcomes, and the extent to differences between populations change research findings and alter treatment effectiveness. These new tools will be tested on data from the United Kingdom's Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), treating six geographic areas as if they were each contributing data to a distributed network like CNODES. Finally, the tools will be used to study 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 data from the CPRD, Ontario, and British Columbia to understand how the timing of lockdowns and other pandemic prevention measures impacted whether patients initiated various drug treatments for high blood pressure, diabetes, and depression, as well as the frequency of various important health outcomes."

Environ 20% des femmes de 50 ans et plus présentent une ostéoporose. Or, il a été démontré que dans 50% des cas une fracture due à l'ostéoporose amène à une perte de dépendance, et dans 20% des cas à une mort prématurée. Dans son ensemble cela a donc un impact important des coûts de santé. La perte de masse musculaire amène a des incapacités physiques et donc à des chutes. La force musculaire semble être reliée à la DMO. Ce lien s'expliquerait par le fait que les muscles, en exerçant un stress sur les os, favoriseraient le renforcement et la solidité de ces derniers. L'objet de notre étude est d'examiner la relation entre la force musculaire et la densité minérale osseuse chez la femme post-ménopausée.

Older adults' bodies contain a lifetime's worth of environmental contaminants (ECs), many of which can remain in their systems for decades. Elders are highly vulnerable to ECs neurotoxicity, because they have a reduced capacity to compensate for impairment. Associations between exposure to ECs and the risk of developing dementia were found in late employees of electrical capacitors, exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls, but also in farmers, exposed to pesticides. Occupational exposure to ECs has also been related in aging people to sub-clinical deficits in cognitive functions, such as attention, memory. At lower exposure, i.e. non occupational ones, similar associations were observed in elders. A significant proportion of what is considered to be ""normal"" age-related cognitive decline may, in fact, be due to ECs. One plausible mechanism of action of ECs would be through disruptions the system of stress hormones. Yet, in aging people, stress response has been shown to significantly contribute to the increased inter-individual variability in cognitive performance. Furthermore, impaired stress response was related to ECs in various studies on animal species. Recently, a significant relation between Lead exposure and impaired stress response has been reported in children. We propose to test whether adverse association between ECs and cognition in aging people is due to impairment in the stress response. Results of this pilot study would provide significant new insights into the influence of the physical environment on mental health in elders"

Importantly, those who were retired were more likely to have more self-reported depressive symptoms, whereas belonging to particular groups was related to better coping and mental health. Specifically, participation in volunteer groups was negatively related to depressive symptoms and positively related to well-being. As expected, participation in religious groups was strongly associated with the use of religious coping, but negatively associated with the use of two traditionally aversive coping strategies: rumination and emotional expression. Here, relying less on rumination accounted for less self-reported depression and greater well-being. On the other hand, belonging to a physically-active group was positively related to cognitive restructuring, active distraction, and using humour to cope, and the use of active distraction accounted for fewer depressive symptoms and greater well-being. Taken together, these findings highlight the importance of continuing social participation throughout the lifespan; however, while various types of social group memberships appear to be important for maintaining mental health, the coping mechanisms through which these relationships exist may be different depending on the type of group identity."

Gender is highly associated with tobacco use - the world's leading preventable cause of cancer. Close to half of all preventable cancers diagnosed in Canada are associated with tobacco use and tobacco use is the world's leading preventable cause of cancer. Gendered tobacco use patterns have been observed in nearly every country in the world for decades, and yet, no quantitative analysis has evaluated the gendered effects of global tobacco control interventions. This project will innovate new quantitative methods to evaluate the global gendered impacts of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), leveraging our previous work to accelerate the production of datasets, methodological innovations, and high-impact publications. Specifically, our team (1) Generate the first internationally-comparable gender-disaggregated tobacco consumption database for over 75 countries; (2) Estimate gendered differences in the number of cigarettes smoked per day among current smokers (i.e. smoking intensity) in different regions of the world; (3) Evaluate the FCTC's gendered impacts on cigarette consumption by reproducing our landmark quasi-experimental evaluation of this international law's global impact separately for men and women; and (4) Examine whether the FCTC significantly changed pre-existing tobacco consumption trajectories for men and women using in-sample forecast event modelling. By producing the first quantitative evidence of whether the FCTC has had gendered global impacts, we aim to generate the tools needed to empower quantitative researchers around the world to conduct gender-focused analyses of international law and ultimately design more equitable global cancer prevention interventions."

In Canada, displaced people include landed immigrants, political/environmental refugees, non-status/temporary workers, and internal migrants which include urban Aboriginal groups. Displacement greatly impacts people's health because it disrupts several determinants of health simultaneously. Furthermore, the acceleration of climate change, environmental degradation, and resource depletion has led to warnings of economic instability, food and energy insecurity which can intensify migration. Given that these emerging 'glocal' challenges disproportionately impact the health of displaced groups, we propose a multi-stage program of research that aims to identify innovative approaches to the production of pathways to health equity through socially-engaged citizenship for displaced populations. In the post-LOI phase, we aim to refine the proposed project, our governance structure and our community of practice(COP). In Phase 1 (1y), we capitalize on existing knowledge from research/practice cases (organized around 3 key determinants of health for this population: rights to health services, labour participation, and environmental health) to deepen theoretical, methodological and contextual understandings regarding health equity. Phase 2 (9m), is oriented to mobilizing knowledge (regarding gaps, insights, promising practices) for the design of interventions to promote health equity for displaced groups.  In Phase 3 (2y6m) two community based research interventions will be implemented in partnership with the COP. In Phase 4 (9m) knowledge generated related to intersectionalities, contextual challenges, and inclusive methodologies will be translated and disseminated to relevant knowledge users. Overall, our program of research facilitates the transferability of existing knowledge and considers emerging glocal realities to inform sustainable policy and practice for the future."

Suicide prevention has become a priority for many Aboriginal and health care leaders, communities, and governments. In some communities, this has lead to improved access to mental health services and investments in local wellness initiatives. Despite these efforts, some communities in northern Labrador continue to have a high suicide rate. 
For my doctoral research, I am examining suicide in Labrador with both community-based and statistical methods, through partnerships with Aboriginal groups and the regional health authority. I believe that sharing local information with these groups is needed to help understand the problem, reduce inequalities, and improve community and health system approaches to prevention. During initial consultations, I met with Aboriginal community groups and health care staff in Labrador to talk about how communities cope with suicide and what they do to prevent it. This helped me develop the following research questions based on local priorities:
1)Do suicide rates vary by region?
2)What health services do people use in the year before they die by suicide?
3)What health services do people with suicidal behaviour use after visiting the emergency department?
I collected and analyzed data from interviews, vital statistics, and personal medical records to answer these questions. This included information about demographics, health history, health service use, and cause of death.
As part of my knowledge translation activities I have submitted two abstracts for presentations at the International Congress on Circumpolar Health in Finland in June 2015. At this meeting, I will share results from a study that compared suicide and injury rates between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal populations, and from another study on health service use among patients with suicidal behaviour."

Communities in Labrador need information to help identify at-risk groups, develop effective prevention programs, and improve access to health care services. As part of my doctoral research, I am working with Aboriginal governments, the Goose Bay hospital, and other community groups to gather information about suicide. The goal is to better understand the factors that increase the risk for suicide attempts and suicide deaths and to identify other factors that protect against these risks. To achieve this, I will be collecting and analyzing information on suicide attempts and suicide deaths from a community survey, medical records, and interviews with people who have attempted suicide and their caregivers. Community groups will use the results of my research to develop health services and policies to improve mental health in Labrador."
Healthy aging and social connectedness in a Northern context: Considerations for municipal planning,"['Pollock, Nathaniel J']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2100.0,364672,"Health determinants such as social support, food security, and the built environment play important roles in promoting seniors' health. Social isolation has been shown to be an important factor for both physical and mental health among seniors. Interventions that promote social connectedness have shown some benefit in reducing isolation.  
     By examining the local context for aging in Labrador, this project seeks to contribute policy-relevant and contextualized knowledge to municipal planning related to infrastructure and seniors' services. The objectives of this study are to understand how older adults and seniors perceive healthy aging, and to explore factors that contribute to social connectedness. 
     This community-based, qualitative study involves a partnership between the regional Inuit government, a local wellness coalition, and a research team based in Labrador. During the initial phase, we carried out community consultations to develop an understanding of local seniors' issues and the current state of supportive services. We engaged organizations that serve seniors including faith groups, health and social care programs, and local governments, to help develop relevant research questions. We then conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 community-dwelling adults aged 60 years and older in two Labrador communities.
     Participants emphasized the important roles of both family and friends in meeting basic needs and helping seniors continue to live at home. These relationships help facilitate involvement in food harvesting, and social and cultural events. Seniors also noted the benefits of accessible community space as an important factor in fostering social connections.
     These results underscore the value of informal and multigenerational social networks for healthy aging, while also highlighting opportunities for local governments to support initiatives that may reduce isolation among seniors in a Northern context."
Exposure to fast food vs other restaurant types in relation to the development of diabetes and hypertension: a population-based retrospective cohort study,"['Polsky, Jane Y']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],665.0,400186,"BACKGROUND: The types and density of different stores and restaurants located near where people live can shape residents' food choices and subsequent risk of obesity and other chronic diseases, like diabetes and hypertension. OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether residents living in areas with a high proportion of fast-food restaurants relative to total restaurants are more likely to develop diabetes or hypertension, and whether this risk varies by volume (i.e. number) of fast-food restaurants. METHODS: We performed a population-based, retrospective cohort study in 2,940,804 adults aged 20+ who lived within walking distance (800 m) of at least one restaurant in one of five urban regions of southern Ontario. Administrative health databases were used to follow individuals from 2003 to 2013 for the development of diabetes and hypertension. RESULTS: Among younger adults (aged 20-49, 1,939,825 people in the diabetes sample and 1,830,873 people in the hypertension sample), living near more restaurants of any type was associated with slightly lower risk of developing diabetes and hypertension. However, living near a greater proportion of fast-food outlets relative to all restaurants increased the risk of both outcomes, particularly in areas with high volumes (5+) of fast-food restaurants. For both the development of diabetes and hypertension, weaker associations with fast-food exposures were observed for adults aged 50-64, and few significant associations were seen for adults aged 65+.   
CONCLUSIONS: Areas with the double burden of high volume of fast-food outlets and few restaurant alternatives may represent an adverse environment for the development of diabetes and hypertension, particularly among younger adults. Health promoting policies that merely target the volume of fast-food restaurants may be ineffective without also considering the overall balance of more and less healthful food retailers."

This study, designed by Indigenous People living with HIV, focuses on the potential for land-based approaches to promote wellness. First, we will convene ""HIV olders"" (i.e., Indigenous people living long-term with HIV) and other Indigenous community leaders to design a 4-6 day land-based wellness program. Next, we will implement the program with Indigenous People living with HIV from throughout Alberta and BC - we call these participants ""knowledge gatherers"". During this phase, we will investigate research questions about the impact of land-based approaches, the role of ""HIV olders"" in building the capacity of others, and about land-based research methods. In the final phase, we will ""weave our wisdoms"". That is, we will build on existing and new relationships with First Nations, Métis and Inuit communities across the country to explore land-based approaches to wellness.

This study will be housed at the Canadian Aboriginal AIDS Network, which has a long track record of successfully implementing research that is meaningful to Indigenous People living with HIV. The study is guided by four complementary approaches to research: (1) community-based research, (2) Indigenous knowledge, (3) decolonizing methods, and (4) two-eyed seeing.

The overall goal of this Cafe is to raise awareness of the growing list of health risks associated with tobacco use as well as to promote the importance of basic research to the public. The researchers will explain how young people are still targeted by the tobacco industry and demonstrate how cigarette smoke makes the body more susceptible to a wide range of diseases, focusing on cancer. A Canadian Cancer Society representative will discuss the Society's tobacco cessation programs and opportunities for youth to become involved in anti-tobacco advocacy work."
"""It's not as diverse as it could be"": how participants in Hamilton's Neighbourhood Action are addressing issues of inclusion","['Pothier, Melanie']",['N/A'],"['Civic Engagement', 'Inclusion And Equity', 'Participatory Urban Planning', 'Social And Cultural Dimensions Of Health']",1309.0,331839,"This presentation outlines part of a qualitative case study of a collaborative, resident-led community development initiative in Hamilton, Ontario. The initiative, known as Neighbourhood Action (NA), engages residents in 11 neighbourhoods in collaboration with local service providers, city staff, and community developers. NA is a response to levels of concentrated poverty in the identified neighbourhoods, which reflects growing economic and social disparities in the city. My research explores how NA participants are taking up this new model of community development. Drawing on interviews, participant observation, and focus groups (Neighbourhood Action Evaluation, University of Toronto), I will outline residents' perceptions of inclusion in the project, highlighting barriers and enablers to diverse, representative participation in NA. Specifically, I will highlight how barriers to participation are reproduced and/or challenged by participants. If Neighbourhood Action seeks to address inequity experienced by residents in low income neighbourhoods by engaging residents directly in urban planning processes, it is necessary to investigate who is participating and how traditional barriers to civic engagement might be playing out in this context. In this way, practitioners and participants might gain insights about fostering more representative, meaningful participation among a wide cross-section of community members."
How does parenting interact with genetic differential susceptibility in predicting attachment patterns in preschool-aged children?,"['Potter-Dickey, Amelia M']",['N/A'],"['Attachment Pattern', 'Developmental Origins Of Health And Disease', 'Differential Susceptibility', 'Early Childhood Development', 'Genetics', 'Health Promotion', 'Longitudinal', 'Maternal-Child Interaction Quality', 'Nursing', 'Secondary Analysis']",105000.0,439667,"Attachment represents a brain-based biological evolutionary system that helps to ensure the survival of the human infant (Bakermans-Kranenburg, 2015). A secure attachment is when a child feels secure, safe, and protected while exploring the world around them (Ainsworth, 1978). Secure attachment to a caregiver is critical to healthy brain and organ-system development, optimal child behaviour, and adult mental and physical health. Caregiving qualities, such as how sensitive caregivers are in responding to their infants' needs (i.e., sensitivity), were thought to be the most significant influence on whether an infant develops a secure attachment pattern (Ainsworth, 1978; Feeney, 2016). However, there is an increasing debate on how much caregiver sensitivity alone influences attachment pattern development, leading to the exploration of other contributing factors such as genetics (Belsky, 2015). Gene by environment studies look at how the environment can influence early childhood development, disease, and health overall (McAllister, 2017). However, there are few studies examining gene-environment interaction and the influence this has on developing attachment patterns (Golds, 2020). This research will examine how children's genetics interact with the caregiving environment in predicting attachment patterns. We plan to examine these factors in a sample of 176 participants who were a part of the larger Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON) study. This research will show the degree to which children's genetics contribute to their attachment pattern, with implications for deepening our understanding of the developmental origins of health and disease. This knowledge will advance our ability to target programs and nursing interventions to specific populations based on children's genetics and caregiving environments and therefore contribute to improving the health of Canadians."

One factor that contributes to obesity is the over consumption of junk foods that are high in salt, sugar, and/or fat. Disparities in health exist amongst children and youth, with males having higher rates of obesity and consuming more added sugar and sodium compared to females. Unhealthy food marketing promotes poor dietary behaviours among children and youth and is likely contributing to differences in food intake and obesity between males and females. Youth have access to multiple digital devices, spend considerable time online and are exposed to high levels of unhealthy food marketing in digital media which may worsen sex differences in health. To date, little research has examined how gender influences young people's exposure to digital food marketing. This research will determine (1) whether young people's exposure to unhealthy food advertising differs by gender, (2) whether their exposure to marketing techniques differs by gender, and (3) how different gender groups engage with promotional messages. A sample of 600 boys and 600 girls ages 11-15 will be recruited to complete a survey regarding their usual online behaviour, the number of digital media sources where they report being exposed to food advertising, and their exposure to related promotional techniques. Screen capture recordings of 120 minutes of smartphone use with a sub-sample of 100 girls, boys and non-cisgender youth will be used to assess child and youth exposure to unhealthy food marketing on social media. This screen capture footage will be reviewed to quantify child and youth exposure to food marketing and related marketing techniques. Interviews will be conducted to assess how each gender interprets and engages with these promotional messages. This research will help inform policies in Canada and abroad aimed at protecting both boys and girls from unhealthy food advertising in digital media."

Others see them rather as a bridge to other community services that help people pull through. Who is right? 
For now, there is insufficient scientific data available to settle the matter. In a previous study we demonstrated the positive effects of food donation on food safety and on the physical and mental health of those using these community organizations. The results must be confirmed, however, and several questions remain. What is the trajectory of the people who call on these organizations? Do they find the guidance they need to overcome the hardships at the root of their request for food? In what way? On what conditions? Is the situation different in Montreal, in the periphery, or in rural areas? It is in an attempt to answer these questions that our team proposes to meet, three times over two years, 1,800 new users of 180 community organizations offering food donations in four regions of Quebec (Montreal, Montérégie, Lanaudière, and Mauricie-Centre-du-Québec). Interviews with organization heads and with users with different pathways will help complete the picture.

Her high impact scholarship was avant-garde and her originality spawned a new way of thinking about prevention. Her writing on ecological approaches to prevention, inequality paradox and social health inequalities altered the national and international academic landscape.

Since the early 1990s, Professor Potvin has secured significant funding to tackle social inequalities in health. The pace and quality of her scholarly research and publications is unmatched in the field. Professor Potvin took the intellectual risks required to inspire a new generation of health promotion and preventive medicine scholars and practitioners. Now, as the Director of the Institut de Recherche en Santé Publique at Université de Montreal, Dr  Potvin scholarly insights continue to greatly enhance the integration of research within the practice of preventive medicine.

Dr Potvin have led the evaluation of major community-based prevention initiatives. From these experiences she developed innovative evaluation models and methodology, better adapted to the complexity of community-based prevention. Her work has greatly influenced the actual practice of collaborative research on public health interventions. Dr. Potvin has also been very active in supporting policy-makers' efforts to mainstream health equity issues within public health programs and policies in Canada and internationally.

It also protects mothers against some types of cancers.  By making children and mothers healthier, breastfeeding reduces the costs to society by decreasing rates of hospitalizations, especially in young infants.  

Exclusive breastfeeding (feeding no other foods or liquids than breast milk) is recommended for the first 6 months after birth.  In Canada, breastfeeding rates are high right after birth, but they drop quickly over the next few months.  Only 14% of mothers exclusively breastfeed their child at 6 months.  

We know that doctors' recommendations have a direct impact on how long women will breastfeed, and that helping mothers with breastfeeding problems is part of physicians' responsibility.  Unfortunately, residents (doctors-in-training) in Canada do not learn how to help mothers breastfeed during their training period.  We also know from our previous recent study that the beliefs, confidence, attitudes and knowledge of Canadian primary care doctors (family doctors and pediatricians) are suboptimal when it comes to breastfeeding.  This is true also in many other parts of the world.

Given the health, social and economic advantages that breastfeeding provides to babies, mothers and society in general, improving breastfeeding duration is an important public health initiative.  There is therefore a great need to develop a solid learning program for pediatric residents, so as to give them the skills they need to help mothers breastfeed.  We therefore propose to bring together a group of breastfeeding researchers, breastfeeding experts, medical education experts, residents and mothers to develop a program that we will ultimately put in place in residency programs across the country.  This has the potential to increase breastfeeding rates significantly and make our children healthier.

across Canadian. Collectively this group is referred to as the Canadian Consortium for Pandemic 
Preparedness Modeling/Consortium Canadien de modélisation pour la preparation du plan pandémie (with 
CanPan as an abbreviation used in both official languages).

CanPan's collective objective is to gather public health expertise from across Canada and use real time 
demographic and surveillance data to design studies, conduct research and produce valuable tool kits. This 
infrastructure will enable timely identification of optimal prevention and control strategies for infectious 
disease outbreaks for public health policy makers. Recommendations will also be provided to public and 
private business sectors to ensure business continuity during a pandemic.

Together these researchers and specialists will develop risk assessment frameworks that incorporate real 
time data into novel mathematical modeling and surveillance tools to investigate, address and control 
infectious disease outbreaks."
Rapid Pandemic Containment Using Real Time Contact Network Modeling and Wireless Technology,"['Pourbohloul, Babak', 'Tellier, Raymond']","['Halperin, Scott A', 'Langley, Joanne M', 'Meyers, Lauren A', 'Tang, Julian W']","['Contact Networks', 'Mathematical Modeling', 'Pandemic Preparedness Planning', 'Public Health', 'Surveillance', 'Transmission Dynamics']",313380.0,191163,"In April 2009, the first deaths from a novel strain of influenza virus were reported in Mexico and the United States. Scientists have speculated that this strain could spark the second wave of the influenza pandemic in North America during the upcoming fall flu season, thus confirming the importance of research that will help us prepare for pandemics caused by influenza viruses and other emerging respiratory infectious agents, as well as seasonal influenza epidemics. 

Mathematically modeling the patterns of influenza spread is of great benefit for furthering our understanding of disease impact within different settings. It is also a powerful tool for designing rapid and efficient intervention strategies to limit this spread, particularly within highly concentrated small settings such as hospitals and schools. This project will demonstrate how small tags worn by volunteers, known as Radio Frequency Identification (RFID), can rapidly, accurately, and anonymously record the duration and proximity of person-to-person contacts in small settings. 

These data will then be used to inform mathematical models capable of demonstrating the underlying contact network structure during a pandemic, hospital acquired infection outbreak or other crisis. Understanding contact patterns will provide a significant advantage in controlling an outbreak by initially identifying locations and/or groups that may be at higher risk. The epidemiological toolkit developed through this application as well as the data collected during this study are anticipated to improve Canada's ability to prevent and/or respond to an influenza pandemic or other emerging respiratory infections."
An Integrated Real-time Modeling and Surveillance Decision-support Framework to Inform Public Health Emergency Preparedness,"['Pourbohloul, Babak']","['English, Krista']",['Pandemic Preparedness'],515522.0,320536,"Globally, the threat of Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) is on the rise. Significant resources have been invested, albeit sometimes reactive, for the development of pandemic preparedness plans. During recent pandemics, we were challenged to ensure public health and security, quickly and with little information about the new EIDs. Following these incidents, some of the gaps in these plans were apparent. 

Post pandemic consultations with international experts from across pandemic planning research and decision-making, we better understand how to improve our pandemic plans and responses. We have compiled their recommendations to address the knowledge gaps in planning for pandemic outbreaks and public health emergencies. The most prominent recommendations include developing the methods to combine emerging infectious disease surveillance data with dynamic demographic mathematical models to quickly understand an EID. 

This will allow researchers to understand how quickly the EID spreads and generate real-time options for policy makers. The mathematical model, looks at the specific characteristics of the BC population to determine exactly what options would best stop the spread of disease in this province. In parallel, we will conduct a complementary project in a public health agency to learn how this new research becomes the basis for new policy during such an emergency situation. This will ensure the most efficient flow of research to the policy makers for future public health emergencies.

With appropriate regional demographic and surveillance data, these advanced plans can be implemented in other regions both nationally and internationally. By focusing on real-time pandemic management options and knowledge translation networks, we will provide tools to control EIDs in a coordinated and effective way, reducing both the health and economic burden of these diseases."
Under One Sky: Indigenous Experiences of Integrated Healthcare Services,"['Powell, Alicia K']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1038.0,383148,"The integration of healthcare and social services is a strategy often utilized in health policy to tackle health inequalities among vulnerable groups. This is an approach taken to address Indigenous health within Ontario and British Columbia through Indigenous, community-controlled health policies and services. However, little is known about service user and service provider experiences of integrated healthcare offered through Indigenous health policies, and whether this approach is effective in addressing community wellbeing. Through a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach with an Indigenous Health Authority and First Nations communities, this project looks at how integration takes place in practice within community healthcare settings by including the perspectives of service providers, and by understanding the experiences of service receivers. Guided by a research advisory committee, and with a commitment to the principles of OCAP®, information will be gathered through semi-structured interviews and focus groups. This project aims to recognize how First Nations-controlled health policy in BC integrates traditional Indigenous approaches to health with Western healthcare, and how this integration operates in practice through service provision within First Nations communities, and how community members experience this approach. While situated within local contexts, this research broaches an overarching question of whether integration within Indigenous healthcare systems, and as designated through Indigenous health policy, can be effective in meeting the complex care needs of diverse Indigenous communities by drawing on community perspectives and experiences. This research will provide an understanding of Indigenous approaches and experiences of healthcare service integration, where services beyond Western models, such as traditional healing, are incorporated into the structure of service provision."
Bringing it Together: Addressing Indigenous Health Inequalities Through Integrated Healthcare,"['Powell, Alicia K']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],805.0,364710,"The integration of healthcare and social services is a strategy utilized in health policy to tackle health inequalities among vulnerable groups, often focusing in part on social determinants of health (SDOH). This is an approach taken to address Indigenous health within Ontario and British Columbia; however little is known about client and service provider experiences of integrated healthcare offered through Indigenous health policies. Within Ontario, the Aboriginal Healing and Wellness Strategy (AHWS) is an Indigenous health policy aimed at addressing health inequalities. Established through the AHWS, community-based Aboriginal Health Access Centres (AHACs) provide integrated mainstream health services and traditional Indigenous services to Indigenous communities. The author's previous research looked at the ways in which service providers within this setting conceptualized and addressed the health needs of their clients. Findings from this community-engaged study demonstrate that service providers effectively utilize the SDOH to understand the causes of health inequalities but are limited in their ability to address those that occur at a structural level. Through a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, the proposed project will gather client and service provider understandings and experiences of integrated healthcare in First Nations community settings in British Columbia under the B.C. Tripartite Framework Agreement on First Nation Health Governance. This presentation brings together the findings from previous research on Indigenous health inequalities and SDOH, and considers the opportunity for the proposed research to understand the experiences and community impacts of policies and services that integrate Western and Indigenous approaches to health and wellness in communities."
The role of collaborated problem-solving in marital relationships for self-reported and objectively measured stress,"['Pow, Jessica L']",['N/A'],"['Cortisol', 'Relationships', 'Stress']",17500.0,281061,"A plethora of research suggests that being married is associated with a variety of health benefits (e.g., Glanz et al., 2009; House et al., 1982). However, other research suggests that not all marriages are beneficial for health (Coyne et al., 2001) and very little research has been conducted to identify which specific relationship factors contribute to the health benefits of marriage for individuals. In this study, it is our goal to assess whether the ways in which couples approach problem solving (e.g., collaboratively or independently) impacts one important determinant of health: stress. In order to determine the relation between problem-solving style and stress, a community sample of couples will be asked to report the extent to which they approach their partners for help in problem solving. Additionally, participants will be asked to state their current affect quality and provide saliva samples for cortisol estimation approximately every three hours in a 1-week time-sampling assessment. Multilevel analysis will be used to determine whether problem-solving style is related to self-reported and objectively-measured stress."

Furthermore, the influence of mother-infant interaction, in the face of psychosocial risk, on infant health outcomes remains poorly understood. Pakistan has a preterm birth rate of 15.7%, antenatal depression rate of 25%, and and postpartum depression rate of 63%. The context of gender inequality and changing institutions of the family and community support systems create significant social challenges that may impact women's health and the health of their offspring. Given the complex and dynamic nature of the determinants of women's health, Pakistan, therefore, provides a unique opportunity to understand psychosocial risk and relationships to preterm birth, infant mortality and neurodevelopment. The planning meeting will build on two pilot studies and expand the research team to undertake a follow-up larger scale study to explicate the relationship between psychosocial risk in pregnancy and postpartum on infant outcome (preterm birth), infant mortality and infant neurodevelopment. The study will also determine the moderating influence of social support and maternal-infant interaction on infant outcomes in this high-risk sample. Future research will test the effect of interventions aimed at improving maternal and infant health outcomes."

In this project, we explored Positive Aboriginal Women's perceptions of 'health' instead of illness, and we considered the unique and everyday strengths and gifts that some PAW use in their lives to thrive, not merely survive. The purpose of this proposal is to seek funds for a 2 day dissemination workshop to be held in conjunction with the International Indigenous Pre-Conference on HIV/AIDS on July 20 & 21. We will focus on sharing our research findings with conference delegates and engaging them in discussions focused on the policy and practice implications of our work."

Rather, our behaviours impact on the other behaviours that we do. Over time, people develop patterns of behaviour such that one behaviour is linked to another one. For some people, the more physical activity they engage in, the less alcohol they drink and less they smoke. This extends beyond lifestyle: spending time raising young children is linked to healthy eating, but work behaviour is linked to unhealthy eating. However, guidelines and support for healthy aging remain out of step with this reality, instead focusing on individual health behaviours (such as healthy eating) isolated from the multiple health and other behaviours that characterize daily life as adults. Understanding what determines the patterns of behaviours in Canadians as they age, and how different patterns are linked with physical and mental health and life satisfaction may provide opportunities to move beyond support strategies that focus on a single behaviour and to promote change across multiple health behaviours. Our experienced team will use data collected from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) to determine whether Canadians can be grouped in terms of the different patterns of health, family, community, or work behaviours that they do. We will then investigate whether particular social or demographic features are associated with these patterns of multiple behaviours, and whether there are differences in health and life satisfaction across these patterns of behaviour. Similar analyses have been conducted in other countries, but not yet in Canada. CLSA data provide a unique opportunity to study these questions. Our findings will help to develop new support for healthy aging that considers the pattern of multiple behaviours that define an adults' everyday life that may better reflect the real-world complexity of caring for Canadians as they age."

Population health approaches to health behaviour change often involve raising awareness and promoting motivation to change. While important, even when awareness increases and motivation is high, life can get in the way. This can lead to a gap between what people know and want to do, and what they actually do. Since the early 90s, research has focused on how to bridge this intention-behaviour gap. The best-evidenced strategy to date is the formation of 'implementation intentions', which goes beyond goal setting to moving motivation into health behaviour change. Implementation intentions involve forming very specific plans in a very specific way to 'program' your brain to automatically react to specific situations so that when you encounter those situations, you are more likely to act on your good intentions instead of having to make the decision on the spot, potentially getting side-tracked. This elegant, social science-based 'brain hack' is remarkably effective when done correctly. It is inexpensive, easy to deliver, takes little time, based on people's own life context and could be delivered at population scale. We recently finished a Cochrane review of health studies that randomly assigned people to form implementation intentions or not. We found 118 studies involving over 33,000 people worldwide, and showed that this technique works. However, much of the evidence is from small studies (< 200 people) with short-term follow-up (< 6 months). The promise of this strategy for population health is clear and now is the time to test it at scale. We will bring together key international experts that developed the evidence behind implementation intentions to plan a first-in-Canada large-scale evaluation with long-term follow-up of implementation intentions for health behaviour change."

It is still unclear what influences whether Canadians engage in PHSM behaviours, what enablers and barriers they face when engaging in them, what influences their long-term use and how these factors differ across specific groups especially historically excluded and equity-deserving groups. This hinders our ability to design tailored, behaviourally optimized, culturally appropriate programs to promote PHSM. We will address this by setting up a responsive, nimble and inclusive platform that will enable our knowledge users (public health units & community groups in 3 Ontario cities) to leverage behavioural science in ways that reflect their evolving priorities as the pandemic continues. We will generate a rapid understanding of what influences engaging in PHSM to create strategies to promote greater uptake and engagement in PHSM in ways that reflect the realities of priority groups in each city (including historically excluded and equity-deserving groups). We will work with our public health and citizen partners to recruit diverse samples that we will interview using a validated behavioural science framework. This will generate information about enablers/barriers to taking up and sustaining PHSM to enable tailoring to each group. We will investigate whether sex, gender, age, and other social identity factors modify enablers/barriers for each PHSM. The results will inform a) public health programs targeting sustained and effective PHSM to reduce risk of transmission and infection and b) management of future infectious disease outbreaks.

To address this, our research team is using an innovative research methodology to develop research questions that are meaningful for 2SLGBTQIA+ individuals who experience pain. Citizen Science is a way for the public to actively contribute their knowledge, health-related information, and personal experiences with health to help shape science. Our team has developed an online platform that uses the principles of Citizen Science, where members of the public who experience pain can share information about their symptoms and experiences, providing important information to help us better understand their unique needs. We will use this information to develop research questions addressing the specific concerns of 2SLGBTQIA+ individuals. Our research program involves reviewing existing studies, gathering pain-related information from the 2SLGBTQIA+ public using our online platform, collaborating with a diverse working group of 2SLGBTQIA+ individuals (patients, clinicians and researchers) to co-develop research questions, and reconnect with the public to co-prioritize these questions. We will use various strategies (in-person events and online outreach) to ensure diversity of study participants, including perspectives of those who are often overlooked in pain research.

Research shows the more time a person spends being sedentary, their risk for heart disease and death increases. These risks exist even if someone exercises regularly. It is unknown how sedentary heart patients are and if they have similar levels of risk. Cardiac rehabilitation is often recommended for people who have experienced a cardiac event and mostly focuses on achieving 30 minutes of physical activity most days of the week. Guidelines for defining daily limits of sedentary time do not exist. In order to make recommendations, sedentary time among heart patients needs to be measured and relationships with health risks assessed. It is also important to identify factors that could affect rehab programs in limiting sedentary time. The purpose of this project is to measure sedentary time among patients with heart disease and to look at if it is related to similar risk factors for disease. The project hopes to understand if sedentary time places heart disease patients at a greater risk for experiencing future health events that require a visit to the hospital, doctor or surgery. Health care costs associated with these events will be calculated. We will also look at whether sedentary time is linked to personal or environmental factors to understand what things could be targeted to decrease time spent being sedentary. Information will be used from a study testing a new program to help patients maintain activity levels upon graduation from a supervised rehab program. It will help practitioners to understand the risks of this health behaviour and inform the development of sedentary guidelines and interventions for cardiac rehab. If sedentary time is in fact a risk factor for future health disease and health events in this population, then targeting these behaviours will increase upon patient care and quality of life and likely lead to reductions in health care costs."

The Agency also recognizes the importance of the environments that support healthy behaviours and are also committed to providing surveillance on factors in these environments. The work proposed for this fellowship will identify the best measures to use in Canadian surveillance for measuring sedentary behaviours at home, work, in travel and during leisure time.  Further, it will identify factors in the environments related to these behaviours and identify how best to measure them. The fellowship will also assess the accuracy of measuring physical activity in children as part of a new national health survey. Priority setting for the measures will be undertaken and a strategy to disseminate knowledge from the research to partners such as program and policy developers, as well as the public will be developed.  The proposed research will improve the health of Canadians and the health delivery system by providing sound information on which to base decisions for policy and program develop, as well as to evaluate current programming."

These cycle abnormalities may be normal and usually resolve. When seeing a doctor for ""funny cycles"", despite no birth control needs, younger women are often prescribed estrogen/progestin as combined hormonal contraceptives (CHC). Canada-wide, random population data in over 500 women ages 16-24 from the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study Youth Cohort show that 76% used ""the Pill."" Two-thirds (66%) of these women started CHC, not for contraception, but as a treatment! CHCs are not entirely benign. In teenaged women, CHC are related to less-than-normal bone density gains. The teen years are when 100% of peak hip and 95% of peak spine bone is achieved. Lower peak bone density is linked to fractures in older women. A randomized controlled trial showed that cyclic progesterone (for half the cycle) caused a 1-year 2% spine bone gain (versus placebo's 2% loss). The purpose of this proposal is to provide teen/young women and doctors/nurses with information that ""funny cycles"" threaten bone health and progesterone is an effective treatment. There are four messages: 1) funny cycles usually recover with ""growing up"", stress reduction and good nutrition; 2) CHC are not without risk for teen bone health when contraception is not yet required; 3) cyclic progesterone will build bones as cycles recover; and 4) ABCs of teen/young women osteoporosis prevention tips will improve bone health. These bone health messages will be shared on YouTube in a 5-minute informational video about bone growth, cycles and progesterone; creating cartoon YouTube clips (French voice-overs) on the ABC's of teen and young women's bone health, having public and doctor information sessions in five BC regional cities with media coverage and developing  and sharing results of an online survey about younger women's knowledge, preferences and desires related to birth control, menstrual cycles and bone health."

risk of adverse health outcomes. Gender - known to impact health behaviours, needs, and opportunities for health - is thought to be particularly influential in shaping health-related experiences during emerging adulthood. However, little is known about the relationship
between gender and experiences of type 1 diabetes and diabetes self-management as well as how gender might affect the delivery of care to this group. This study aims to provide a theory-informed understanding of the ways in which gender frames individuals' perspectives of type 1 diabetes, impacts self-management practices, and informs delivery of care. To achieve this aim, we will employ critical and arts-based qualitative methods as well as Bourdieu's Theory of Practice. In phase 1, we will conduct focus groups and individual photo elicitation interviews with 30 emerging adults living with type 1 diabetes. Leveraging results from phase 1, we will construct a photographic exhibit that will be shared with formal (e.g. physician, nurse) and informal (e.g. family/friends) care providers in phase 2. Twenty individuals will be recruited from each group (total n=40) to participate in an interview to discuss their perceptions of the exhibit. These interviews are intended to capture the relevance/impact of the exhibit and how it may inform delivery of care and support. Results from this study will provide a deeper understanding of the ways that gender frames illness experiences for emerging adults living with type 1 diabetes and enhance the personalization of care for this group as a result. Findings will also be used to help build a community of emerging adults living with type 1 diabetes and foster opportunities for greater peer support."
Temporal Associations between Obesity and Asthma in Pubertal Children: A Substudy of the Gender-Related Evolution of Asthma Team (GREATice),"['Protudjer, Jennifer L']",['N/A'],"['Asthma', 'Birth Cohort', 'Children', 'Gender', 'Mixed Methods', 'Multidisciplinary', 'Obesity', 'Sex']",105000.0,184693,"Childhood obesity and asthma have increased dramatically in Canada in the past 3 decades.  Not surprisingly, obesity and asthma each have huge direct and indirect costs on the national healthcare system.  It is accepted that obesity and asthma are linked, with recent research suggesting that obesity may precede asthma.  Although this relationship is not fully understood, we know that asthma is more common in pre-pubertal boys, but in girls from puberty onward.   Thus, we believe that sex hormones and psychosocial factors, both of which are known to influence puberty, influence this association.  Using data from the CIHR-funded 1995 Manitoba Birth Cohort, the proposed study will consider various ways in which obesity and asthma may be linked.  This will be achieved through two aims: 1) to characterize the temporal association between weight status and subsequent incident asthma diagnosis by hormonal changes and lifestyle patterns, and 2) to describe children's experiences of living with asthma.  We hypothesize that a gender-specific association exists between overweight and subsequent incident asthma.  This question will be investigated from specific focal areas: gender; hormonal changes/puberty; physical activity/sedentary behaviour; and, dietary patterns.  Preliminary analysis suggests that girls who were overweight at age 8-9 tend to be more likely to develop asthma at age 11-12; this association was not identified in boys.  This study will also provide a ""window of opportunity"" for prevention of disease through knowledge translation and will further enhance our understanding of the gender-shift of asthma.  Collectively, the findings will further our understanding of childhood obesity and asthma, and result in better approaches to and improved outcomes for children and their families."

Compared to families with no food restrictions, families whose children have food allergy are saddled with higher food costs, prior to, and during the pandemic. Yet, existing food banks in Manitoba do not adequately support these families with food allergy, given the increased demand for food bank services by the non-allergic families and thus, the inability of food banks to support families with food allergy. Our patient-oriented food allergy research project aims to understand and mitigate the inequities of food access and insecurity. Using data on food insecurity and food allergy, collected immediately before and during the pandemic, we will establish national rates of food insecurity, and food costs during the pandemic, and compare these to pre-pandemic levels, amongst households managing food allergy. Then, we will conduct an allergy-friendly food delivery intervention  amongst economically-disadvantaged households managing cow's milk allergy in Winnipeg. Data collected at the start, and the end of the trial will help us understand how to mitigate the impact of food allergy and food insecurity, including how mental health is impacted when subsidies are in place. We will share our findings via scientific conferences and publications. Our team of investigators has internationally recognized expertise in pediatric food allergy, mental health and policy. We will work with collaborators with expertise in philanthropy and health economics to use the findings from this one-year study to ensure sustainability of the project.

Food allergy affects every activity where food is involved: at school, socially and at home. When children are told they have food allergy, they are also told that they must never eat the food to which they are allergic. But, always avoiding these foods can be hard. Children are often bullied simply because they have food allergy. Both they and their families have poor psychosocial health. Yet, there are few psychosocial supports for these families. Our team will hold 2 activities that will help us create a program to support these families.  

Activity 1 is a two-day scientific workshop at the University of Manitoba. The aim of this activity is to create meaningful dialogue that would set the foundation for our second activity, the public forum. At the workshop, we will identify questions to guide the public forum. 

Activity 2 is a public forum. The forum will be open to different groups: patient advocacy organisations, families of children with and without food allergy, and teachers. As we want as many people as possible to attend, we will cover parking and bus costs, provide allergy-safe foods, and offer childcare. We will start by talking about the psychosocial impact of food allergy. Then, we will give groups time to talk about, and provide feedback on what they think the key issues are. Groups will then report back to us what they think. We will record all of this information. 

Within one week of the public forum, our team will look at all of the recorded information to identify common ideas. We will use these ideas to create a program to support the psychosocial needs of families with food allergy. We will first create this program in Winnipeg. After we get feedback on the program, and make necessary changes, we will roll this program out across Canada."

There is thus an urgent need to develop and implement effective population-based intervention to help Canadians to further improve their eating-related behaviors. In that context, Health Canada launched in 2010 the Healthy Eating Awareness and Education Initiative (HEAEI). This nutrition education initiative involves stakeholders from different levels, so that most people can be reached through various channels. Its objectives are to increase Canadians' awareness and understanding of healthy eating behaviours, and to motivate consumers to make healthy food choices for themselves and their families, so that it can contribute to improve overall health and decrease risk of chronic diseases. While the two first phases of this nutrition education initiative have been implemented in 2011 (Nutrition labels), and in 2012 (Healthy eating and sodium reduction), Health Canada is actually working on the last phase of the HEAEI that will be implemented in 2013. The third phase aimed at improving food skills that enable healthy eating at home, at the grocery store and when eating out in order to support healthy eating and healthy weights. The project described in this proposal aim at evaluating the public health impact of this third phase of the HEAEI (HEAEI-3). Following a mixed-methods approach, quantitative and qualitative tools will allow us to assess if the HEAEI-3 is reaching the target population, if it has a significant impact on food skills and eating habits, if intermediaries approached participate in the dissemination of the activities, and how they deliver the activites. Such study will provide scientific support to show the potential effectiveness and impact of the HEAEI-3, and will inform policy makers so that they can make improvements to the initiative as it will be implemented over several years."

Evaluating the state of food and beverage marketing to children in recreational sport settings: A cross-sectional assessment and investigation of parents' perceptions,"['Prowse, Rachel']",['N/A'],"['Childhood Obesity', 'Culture', 'Food Marketing', 'Nutrition Environment', 'Parents', 'Perceptions', 'Population Health', 'Recreation And Sport']",105000.0,348036,"Unhealthy food and beverage marketing contributes to poor dietary habits and childhood obesity. Physical activity is often used in food marketing practices to minimize the perceived impact of unhealthy diets on health and weight. Children and adults believe foods to be healthier when they see physical activity on food advertisements. Sport sponsorship, believed to be one of the most powerful marketing techniques, is becoming more common. The World Health Organization recommends restricting marketing to children in settings where children gather, including sport settings, but current regulations in Canada do not adequately protect children. 

This study will: (1) develop a validated tool to measure food and beverage marketing in sport settings, (2) investigate what and how foods and beverages are promoted in recreation facilities and how marketing is related to food and beverage sales, and (3) explore parents' experiences and perceptions of food and beverage marketing in and around children's sports in recreation facilities. The findings from this study will support recreation facilities fulfilling their mandate to promote health, and support existing actions taken to improve foods and beverages they sell. As well, it will support parents and schools in their efforts to provide children with healthy environments. Restricting marketing to children is believed to be one of the most cost-effective population interventions to reduce childhood obesity, chronic disease, and improve quality of life. This research project will provide necessary evidence to develop and implement policy and actions to reduce children's exposure to powerful unhealthy food marketing. It will provide valuable knowledge to the dietetic profession, and other sectors including sports and recreation, food industry, and decision makers in order to understand socio-behavioural determinants of food choice and create supportive environments for healthy dietary choices outside of the home."

It is well established that overweight individuals are at risk for several chronic diseases. Recently, the co-occurrence of obesity and mental health problems has received increased attention. In adults, obesity often co-occurs with depression, however this association is less clear for children. Research is needed in order to
clarify the role of depressive symptoms, which may not only stem from, but could perpetuate disordered eating behaviors into adolescence and adulthood. This study will examine the relationship between obesity and depression from their origins and joint development in childhood. Early risk factors for the development of these two conditions, such as gender and socio-economic status,
will be examined. Data from the ""Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development"", a population sample of 2120 infants followed from 5 months to 10 years, will be used. We hypothesize that overweight children will be more likely to exhibit depressive symptoms, and that this association will be stronger for girls. We expect that early family disadvantage will be associated with the co-occurrence of overweight and depression in children. This research has important implications for population health and Public Health prevention programs, as increasing levels of childhood obesity have become a particular concern. We hope to shed light on the important mental health aspects associated with obesity, which in turn should aid in obesity prevention and treatment program implementation for youth. Eating disorders are a significant problem, often emerging among female adolescents. As public health professionals strive to reduce obesity levels in children, the need to prevent the onset of disordered eating becomes central. This study will help to inform the development of successful prevention programs that can account for the underlying psychological distress associated with overweight and obesity"

We measured average change between 2012 and 2014 in transportation-related physical activity, after the 2013 development of the Comox Greenway, a 2 km corridor in the West End of Vancouver. This group of older adults was highly active, accruing a mean of 287 (±205) minutes per week of transportation-relation physical activity in 2012 and a mean of 253 (±174) minutes per week in 2014. Using fixed-effects linear regression models to assess the within-person changes, we found no significant change in total transportation-related physical activity in three geographic areas (all travel, travel along the Greenway, and travel along a parallel comparison corridor). In particular, we did not see any significant decline in physical activity, which may be expected given age-related changes. We did, however, see a significant decrease in the number of trips per week along the Greenway. Our analysis provides insight into the nuanced ways that a Greenway may encourage older adults to maintain their level of physical activity, but one year post-intervention may not be long enough to capture the true behaviour changes of these older adults."

Every year, for four years, we'll ask youth to tell us in their own words how they're doing, how they experience care and access to it, how they feel their gender identity is respected and affirmed by people around them. This will allow us to develop a nuanced understanding of their needs and experience as navigate gender affirming medical care."
Time-use patterns and the recreational use of prescription medications among youth in rural Canadian settings,"['Pulver, Ariel']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,324521,"Prescription drug abuse among teenagers in Canada is a growing issue, particularly for those living in rural communities. Time spent with friends, family and in extracurricular activities may influence the risk for abusing prescription medications. The purpose of this study was therefore to examine the relationships between rural adolescents' peer, family, and extracurricular time-use and risk of abusing prescription drugs. Over two-thousand rural students in grades 9 and 10 across Canada were asked in the Canadian Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey (2009/2010 Cycle) about their prescription medication abuse in the past year, time outside of school hours with friends, frequency of family meals, and participation in extracurricular activities. We found that many rural teens eat dinner with their families infrequently, spend many evenings out with friends, and do not participate in extracurricular activities. Spending most afternoons and evenings out with friends as compared to few, was associated with an increase in prescription drug abuse. Nonparticipation in extracurricular activities was also a central risk factor for prescription drug abuse. Results support interventions aimed at increasing structured time-use opportunities, including extracurricular options for rural Canadian youth."
Gender disparities in infant and early child health associated with maternal country of birth,"['Pulver, Ariel']",['N/A'],"['Epidemiology', 'Health Equity', 'Immigration', 'Maternal-Child Health']",105000.0,327801,"A large proportion of immigrant women living in Canada are born in countries where females are greatly disadvantaged, including countries in Asia, the Middle-East, and Africa. In these countries, baby girls are less likely than boys to survive infancy or maintain health throughout their childhood. For instance, about 4 million excess female deaths occur each year, mainly in Asia and Africa. Girls are also less likely to receive vaccines and regular health care than boys. This has been attributed to cultural preferences for sons, which may influence household decisions like food, schooling, and medical attention, resulting in the nutritional and medical neglect of girls. It is unknown if the female disadvantage in one's home country remains following immigration to Canada, and to what extent it may influence the health of very young girls.  My study aim is to see whether there are gender-based differences in the health of Canadian-born infants and children by mother's country of birth. I will look for differences in patterns of vaccinations, doctor's visits and hospital visits, and try to understand whether they may vary for children of immigrant women who have greater English language ability, have lived in Canada for longer, or by her level of education. I will use available administrative health care and immigration data from 2.5 million mother-child pairs, including half a million born to immigrant women to achieve my study aim. The purpose of this study is an essential, yet novel one for Canada, as we are home to one of the largest and most ethnically diverse immigrant populations in the world. Moreover, gender equity is hugely important to Canadians, as well is relevant to other Western countries that similarly receive many immigrants. Results may inform programs aimed at helping newcomer women to Canada and their babies."

Research has confirmed that youth who have been in foster care have a high risk of suffering from mental illnesses. They also struggle more than their peers to transition successfully into adulthood; for example, they are more likely to not graduate from high school, have unstable housing and employment, have low incomes, and be involved in criminal activity. Although many negative impacts of foster care have been established, there is a lack of research on how mental illnesses influence the transition into adulthood in this population.

For this analysis, I will use linked databases that include indicators for the entire population of Manitoba. I will also interview youth living in Vancouver who have a diagnosed mental illness and have been in foster care. We will discuss how they think the treatment of their illnesses (or lack thereof) influenced their transition into adulthood and how the system of care could be improved to better support this transition.

While the increased connectivity brings many benefits, it can also expose young people particularly racialized youth to online/technology facilitated sexual violence. Racialized youth who face intersecting forms of marginalization are not only at high risk of experiencing online sexual abuse but they also experience more barriers in accessing care. This in turn often brings significant mental health challenges for youth such as intense fear, guilt, depression, and poor coping. Despite the seriousness of these harms, a large portion of Canadian legislation, social services, and education do not provide young people resources for support and safety that they need. It is important that meaningful support is in place to protect young people from sexual and mental harms. Our research aims to respond to this understudied area. The purpose of this project is to engage racialized young people from Alberta and British Columbia to gather data that will inform effective ways to support youth who experience online sexual abuse and its impact on mental health. Using the collaborative research approach, we will: 1) work with youth to identify existing services and programs for racialized youth who experience online sexual abuse; 2) explore the perceptions of youth on barriers and facilitators in accessing and utilizing the services and programs identified; and 3) co-design a supportive strategy with youth and other stakeholders in combination with the existing literature to inform accessible and inclusive sexual and mental health policy and practices. This project will provide racialized youth with a unique opportunity to work with researchers and youth-focused community organizations to recommend relevant and meaningful support in addressing and preventing online sexual abuse and its associated mental health consequences."

Risk factors for obesity and its consequences are different in various ethnic groups. In Canada, one ethnic group at high risk for the consequences of obesity is South Asians including those from India (Indo-Canadians, one of the fastest growing populations in Canada). Obesity rates are increasing around the world, including countries like India, particularly among children. Not much is known about the influences of individual behaviours, the family, and the physical environment on obesity in Indian children in Canada or those living in India. This research project will find out the similarities and differences in rates of obesity and some of its consequences by studying 400 Indo-Canadian children and 400 rural Indian children and 400 urban Indian children. We will find out about their eating and physical activity patterns, their family situation, and their school and community environments (including food supply and playgrounds) to see if differences between the three settings can explain why some children of Indian origin develop obesity over the following 2-4 years. This information may be used in the future to develop obesity prevention programs tailored to these high-risk groups."

Living Green and Healthy for Teens (LiGHT) - a randomized trial evaluating behaviour change using a gamified healthy living app for youth and their families,"['PUNTHAKEE, Zubin', 'Anand, Sonia S', 'Morrison, Katherine Mary', 'Warshawski, Thomas J']","['Bangdiwala, Shrikant I', 'De Souza, Russell J', 'Kwan, Matthew', 'Masse, Louise C', 'Scott, Donald E', 'Sherifali, Diana T', 'Teo, Koon K', 'Wahi, Gita']","['Adolescents', 'Families', 'Healthy Behaviours', 'Mobile Health App', 'Obesity Prevention', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",948600.0,381088,"Background:
Obesity and the linked cardiovascular risk factors are common in youth, and are associated with health problems later in life. Changing health behaviours is effective in reducing risk factors, but hard to implement. The Living Green and Healthy for Teens app has been rigorously developed as an evidence-based, user-friendly, stakeholder-reviewed tool to facilitate healthy behaviour change.

Goals:
This research will determine whether the gamified LiGHT app for youth and parents will improve healthy eating and activity habits among 10-15 year-olds over 2 years. It will also determine the effects on body fat, weight, fitness, quality of life, as well as parents' eating and activity habits.

Methods and expertise:
500 youth from the Hamilton community who have at least one smartphone in the family will be randomly assigned to receive either the interactive gamified LiGHT app which has both youth and parent interfaces, or a simple list of online resources (control). Visits at 6 months, 1 and 2 years will evaluate questionnaires on food intake, screen and sleep time, as well as 1 week of movement sensor (accelerometry) data to quantify physical activity and sedentary time. The research team has expertise in recruitment and retention among cohorts of youth, as well as successful completion of large randomized trials, and development and community-based implementation of behavioural interventions for obesity treatment and prevention.

Expected outcomes:
Many health apps are either not developed based on evidence or are not engaging for users, and very few are studied systematically for their effectiveness in improving health, especially among youth. This trial will evaluate the fairly long-term use of an app that has been developed in Canada based on these principles. If effective, wide dissemination on a population scale through simple electronic channels will facilitate improved cardiovascular risk profiles for any family with access to a smartphone."
"Examining the role of menopause and hormone replacement therapy on diet, physical activity, and metabolic health among aging females in Canada","['Purcell, Sarah A']","['Jakobi, Jennifer M', 'Jessri, Mahsa', 'Liu-Ambrose, Teresa Y']","['Aging', 'Dietary Intake', 'Health Behaviors', 'Menopause', 'Metabolic Health', 'Physical Activity', 'Public Health', 'Sex Hormones']",70000.0,469511,"Menopause is the natural decrease in sex hormones that occurs in females during aging. During and after menopause, there is a higher risk of developing obesity and poorer physical function and metabolic health, which can increase the risk of conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Hormone replacement therapy can help lessen the symptoms of menopause and reduce the risk of some chronic diseases. Hormone replacement may also impact dietary intake, physical activity, and sleep - called 'modifiable health behaviors', MHBs. However, it is not clear if MHBs (and their relationship to health outcomes) differ according to menopausal status and hormone replacement use. To address this knowledge gap, the research team will use data collected from females in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging - a large study that measures several aspects of health using robust tools to identify predictors of healthy aging. The proposed research project will characterize MHBs, their relationship to health outcomes that are important for aging, and how these relationships change across time among four groups of females: 1) pre- or peri-menopausal, 2) post-menopausal who have never used hormone replacement, 3) post-menopausal who currently use hormone replacement, 4) post-menopausal who have previously used hormone replacement. MHBs will be measured from self-reported information on diet, physical activity, and sleep. Health outcomes will include lean and fat tissue, physical function, and metabolic health using objective measurements. This will be the first study to investigate MHBs with a large number of objective health outcomes according to menopausal and hormone replacement status. It will provide a better understanding of the potential short- and long-term effects of menopause and hormone replacement. Therefore, the findings may help inform decision making regarding hormone replacement use and the design of personalized health interventions to support healthy aging."

When diagnosed early, patients' five year survival may be close to 90%. BC's new pilot screening program for colorectal cancers will lead to more people being diagnosed early, receiving treatment and experiencing long-term survivorship.As health care providers, we have heard patients' stories about frustrations with the information or lack of information they receive during their care and treatment. We recognize that treatment for people with CRCs requires the services of multiple health care professionals at distinguishable points in time (eg. diagnosis, treatment and survivorship)and information can be fragmented and inconsistent - who should be providing what information and when? Understanding cancer patients' information needs is seen as the crucial first step in designing interventions to best meet the needs of cancer patients.
To identify specific information needs for people with CRCs, we propose a scoping review guided by the question: what does the literature tell us about the information provided by health are professionals and needed by people with colorectal cancers across the cancer care continuum?  The objectives of this scoping review are to: a) identify current literature that reports on and addresses the information needs of people with colorectal cancer population, b)identify and summarize the discrepancies in this literature, c)identify gaps in the literature that will point to future research and d)distribute findings in order to enhance awareness among health care professionals, decision makers and patients.This study will contribute to understanding the dynamic nature of the information needs of people with CRCs across their cancer care continuum.Integrated knowledge translation will provide a foundation for future evidence-based intervention studies in order to improve care for this patient population."

This is particularly true in low- and middle-income countries, such as the Philippines. A promising approach that can help address the mental health needs of children and youth is the use of peer-based supports and services, which can be less expensive and more accessible than those offered by mental health specialists. In this project, we propose to engage with and build collaboration among key stakeholders in the Philippines to identify the characteristics and features of a feasible and acceptable peer-based mental health supports for children and youth. The knowledge and information that will be generated by our proposed activities (e.g. stakeholder consultations, environmental scan) will inform the preparation of grant applications that will support the future development of a pilot peer-based program, and its evaluation and scale-up."

The Qaujigiartiit Health Research Centre is putting forth this proposal on behalf of our collective of 4 Inuit-governed community-led independent Nunavut-based organizations that are leading research in various areas. Our unifying approach is that research should be used as a tool for action in our communities. Research for the sake of curiosity is not supported by our communities. Without action, there is no research.

The Nunavut NEIHR will be a centre of excellence for Inuit methods, approaches, and tools, and provide training and support to the next generation of Inuit students and scholars in Nunavut. Each of the 4 'hubs' identified in this proposal are leaders in research and interventions that build on Inuit pathways to wellbeing. By coming together under the rubric of the NEIHR, we will elevate that research and these approaches to a national and international level. We will also formally coordinate and share our capacity and infrastructure to foster a learning environment for Inuit scholarship that will be unparalleled in Canada.

With regard to feasibility: Since our inception, we have brought Inuit research methods into the forefront of discourse pertaining to Inuit health, and we have collectively brought more than 25 million dollars into the territory to strengthen the capacity of our communities to lead research. Qaujigiartiit, as the host institution, has a demonstrated record of excellence in the management of federal monies for the purposes of research and training, has an independent ethics review board, and has the administrative capacity to oversee the NEIHR."

We will conduct five waves of online survey, each four months apart, to follow a diverse sample of 8,000 adults who lived in Wuhan during the quarantine. The survey will evaluate respondents' mental health, challenges encountered, and community services received during and after the quarantine. We will use survey data to identify individual and community risk factors for mental health outcomes during and after the quarantine, thereby determining the course of post-quarantine recovery and pinpointing the populations that need public health services the most. We will also conduct in-depth interviews with 120 adults who lived in Wuhan during the quarantine to examine, in much greater detail, how people understood, reacted to, and coped with the quarantine, and what local barriers, challenges, and needs existed in combating the COVID-19 outbreak. Our interviews will target vulnerable groups who have special healthcare needs (pregnant women, people with chronic conditions, and the elderly living alone) and people who are primary caregivers (people who care for family members with COVID-19, healthcare workers, and parents of young children).

Using machine learning to improve the detection of frailty,"['Quach, Hoang']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Cardiovascular Disease', 'Frailty Identification', 'Machine Learning']",992.0,497886,"Frailty is a state of vulnerability that significantly impacts individual and public health outcomes. In fact, it is prevalent in almost half of Canadians over the age of 85. My doctoral thesis includes four projects that enhance our understanding of frailty through machine learning, a type of analysis used to identify patterns within large datasets.
 
The first project is a scoping review of machine learning applications within frailty research, cataloguing current methodologies and identifying gaps in knowledge that future work could address. This provides a comprehensive overview of the intersection between technology and geriatric medicine. The second project uses machine learning approaches to improve how we measure frailty in populations living with cardiovascular disease. By examining individual health deficits with aggregate scores, this project proposes a more nuanced method of predicting patient frailty levels. The third project explores the association between biomarkers derived from heart imaging with frailty, particularly in the context of emergency cardiovascular care. By leveraging these algorithms, we can identify biomarkers that may be important in early frailty detection. This can enable timely and individualized frailty interventions. The final project uses unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify patient subgroups within cardiac rehabilitation settings and assess their rehabilitation outcomes. By understanding the newly discovered subgroups, we can better create targeted interventions to support people to succeed in rehabilitation.
 
Together, my doctoral research will highlight the potential of machine learning to improve our understanding of frailty. Through this research, I am actively leveraging machine learning to enhance our ability to detect and manage frailty, ultimately contributing to better health management and outcomes for our aging population."

Data show that the immune system of males and females do not respond to infections in the same way. Females seem to be able to clear viruses more rapidly. Sex hormones and chromosomes seem to play a role in these differences. 
When vaccinated with influenza vaccine, females seem to be able to mount a better response against the vaccine, but may also have more adverse events. What we don't know is if this actually translates into better efficacy, i.e., does the vaccine protect females better than males, with the same dose. 

We therefore aim to review the existing literature in a systematic way and to perform new analyses of data from trials on influenza vaccine, stratified by sex and vaccine type. There is first a need to determine the magnitude in the difference of response to vaccine between males and females to then see how this is translated into public health recommendations."

Among these groups, the risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as heart attack and stroke, is much higher than in the general population. Further, in these groups, care for cardiovascular disease tends to be poor.  This is an important public health issue, as the right care for cardiovascular disease can prevent death and disability, and improve peoples' quality of life.  Cardiovascular disease costs Canadians over $22 billion every year in physician services, hospital costs, lost wages and decreased productivity. For both health and economic reasons, it is critical that we develop effective cardiovascular disease management programs for Canada's largest ethnic populations. Most current research in this area has focused on investigating the causes of ethnic differences in risk. Recently, research has started to focus on the best long term management of cardiovascular disease in various ethnic groups. Studies that have worked to overcome language barriers and lack of knowledge, however, have not had good results.  We feel that an approach that also considers other factors such as cultural views, family roles, and beliefs toward medications and traditional therapies is needed in order to improve the cardiovascular health of ethnic minority groups. Our research team, composed of experts with a wide range of experience in ethnicity research, is already collecting important new data on gaps in cardiovascular care for ethnic groups and the reasons behind them. We are now ready to develop and test strategies to improve care.

Comprising approximately 5.4% of all women diagnosed with breast cancer, research and supports are lacking for this population. To address this, we created RUBY (Reducing the bUrden of Breast cancer in Young women), one of the world's largest prospective cohorts of women with young-onset breast cancer. To date, we have enrolled over 1000 women from 32 sites across Canada at the time of cancer diagnosis following them through treatment and into the survivorship period. Through RUBY, we have identified a number of unique survivorship gaps, including high levels of anxiety at diagnosis and beyond especially given extended hormonal therapies, marital and motherhood challenges, and social isolation. Specific, accessible interventions are required, but are currently lacking. ICAN Survive, is a promising self-management, on-line intervention for patients with cancer designed to address global survivorship issues at diagnosis and beyond. Key areas of need include regaining balance/dealing with diagnosis, coping with treatment and side-effects, management of anxiety and depression, fatigue management, sexuality and relationships. The ICAN intervention aims to build self management skills through guided training and education, however does not focus on the specific needs of young women. Thus, we propose to modify the ICAN intervention in collaboration with young onset survivors and evaluate the modified tool (ICAN-RUBY) for effectiveness. We are uniquely positioned to develop this young women specific intervention given the direct knowledge of gaps identified to date from existing RUBY cohort.  We will leverage established RUBY study infrastructure with a proven track record of recruitment, to evaluate the effectiveness of the ICAN-RUBY tool in an embedded randomized trial."

Cultural Identity in First Nations Youth: The Implications for Self-Determination and Academic Achievement,"['Querengesser, Johanna']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,324517,"Background: North American Indigenous youth are at a heightened risk for negative outcomes resulting from unique challenges including the effects of intergenerational historical trauma and cultural discontinuity (Bombay et al., 2010; Chandler & Lalonde, 1998, 2009; Whitbeck et al., 2004). Although faced with extreme adversity, Indigenous youth have also been remarkable in their capacity to adjust, adapt, and transform in response to challenges and demands. Specifically, a positive identity with their culture of heritage serves as a resilience-promoting factor that contributes to social-psychological well-being, including academic success (Burack et al., 2014; LaFromboise et al., 2006), despite the cultural mismatches they typically face in school settings (Fryberg et al., 2013; Stephens et al., 2012).

Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the influence of cultural identity on perceived levels of self-determination and academic achievement among a group of First Nations youths from Quebec.

Method: Thirty-nine adolescents from grades 6-11 completed the Multi-Ethnic Identity Measure (Phinney, 1992) and the AIR Self-Determination Scale (Wolman et al., 1994). Final grades were used as the measure of academic achievement.

Results: Youths with high cultural identity reported more perceived capacities (t(37) = -2.444, p = 0.019) and opportunities (t(37) = -2.654, p = 0.012) to be self-determined. Cultural identity was significantly higher for those with high self-determination compared to those with low self-determination (Welch's F(3, 12.134) = 7.528, p = 0.004). Grades were not related to any measures. 

Conclusions: Ties to culture of heritage is empowering as the youths with higher scores are more likely to perceive themselves as being self-determined. The lack of association between cultural identity and grades might be explained by cultural mismatch."
Social support and resilience to depression across the life course in Canada,"['Quesnel-Vallée, Amélie', 'Abrahamowicz, Michal M', 'Clark, Shelley', 'Fuhrer, Rebecca', 'Kaufman, Jay S', 'Le Bourdais, Céline', 'Shor, Eran', 'Wrosch, Carsten']",['N/A'],"['Depression', 'Family', 'Life Events', 'Resilience', 'Social Support']",16000.0,273220,"Mental health problems constitute the leading cause of disability insurance claims in Canada (CAMH 2012). Of these problems, depression is the most prevalent in the Canadian population (PHAC 2012), with about one in eight Canadian adults (12.2%) reporting symptoms congruent with a diagnostic of depression at some point over their lives (PHAC 2012). Yet, while we know a lot about the risk factors for depression in Canada, much less is known about factors that allow individuals to ""rebound"" from depression or even to avoid it altogether when they are faced with adverse life events such as job loss or widowhood. 
In order to respond to this need for information, we have assembled an emerging team of investigators whose expertise spans the disciplines of Biostatistics, Demography, Epidemiology, Psychology and Sociology. Our goal is to develop an interdisciplinary research program on resiliency to depression across the life course in Canada to apply for a team grant in the Fall 2013 to the Fonds de Recherche du Québec en Santé program Recherches en Santé et Société (FRQS RSS). 
With this CIHR planning grant, we aim to strengthen our application to this competition along several axes. Thus, we are proposing with this planning grant to engage in the following activities: 
1.Organize a monthly half-day workshop to facilitate interdisciplinary discussion among the team members and develop sections of the FRQS RSS. Funding for this activity will allow us to bring our international research collaborator and other international researchers to these meetings to supplement our videoconferences with in-person interaction. 
2.Create summer research stipends to encourage and facilitate the training of students in interdisciplinary collaborations.
3.Carry out a systematic literature review on the measurement of social support in the literature on resilience to depression."

The objective of this study is to examine whether there are inequalities in well-being between groups of caregivers with different socioeconomic characteristics, or different caregiving situations. We will use data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging which can identify participants who have been providing caregiving support to analyse a range of well-being outcomes, and then compare these to non-caregivers to assess whether there are differences. Then we will explore factors that might statistically explain some of these differences. With this information we hope to be able to influence the development of evidence-informed interventions to better support caregivers in their tasks and to improve wellbeing for everyone."

Intervention stakeholders often desire quick data on program outcomes. Consequently, there is limited research on SBPE interventions that adopt a qualitative approach and focus on evaluating implementation processes. Alberta Health Services (AHS) recognizes the value of an implementation process evaluation (IPE) and is dedicated to learning about the barriers and facilitators of AIG to improve the experiences of all partners and users. 

As a Health Systems Impact Fellow, I will collaborate with AHS to evaluate how/how well AIG is being implemented in four Central Alberta school communities. The evaluation will include in-depth semi-structured interviews with youth influencers, school staff, adult mentors, and AHS staff, and friend-based focus groups with peer learners. These methods offer an effective way to collect individual and group level knowledge regarding implementation, communication networks, experiences, perceptions, and progress towards outcomes. 

The findings will be used to develop an action plan for improving and expanding AIG across Alberta to ensure consistent and equitable access to vaping education for youth."

We have entered a new geological era known as the Anthropocene, a time when human activities have become the determining force of ecological change. At this time, population health faces unprecedented challenges including increasingly virulent infectious diseases, a heightened risk of global pandemics, and reduced access to the ecological foundations of life such as clean air, water, and nutritious food. Concurrently, economic stagnation and looming material and energy constraints limit the resources available to health systems around the world. Faced with these interrelated pressures, health systems must find new ways to secure both long-term human health and environmental sustainability. This planning meeting will bring together leading social scientists and health practitioners working on novel intersectoral approaches to improving population health in the Anthropocene.

Harassment, if left unchecked, will inevitably exacerbate existing recruitment and retention problems and thereby have long-term economic consequences for our health care system.  The proposed research builds upon the team's success in establishing the interactive processes of Participatory Theatre (PT) as a crucial psychosocial resource among health care aides to recognize, name, and address psychological harassment. We will employ the same theatre-based method to explore employee-to-employee harassment with two more occupational groups of caregivers. Our research examines harassment through a participatory research approach. PT scenarios depicting harassment experienced by aides, LPNs, and RNs will be developed in a series of workshops and then performed to a larger audience of these caregivers. The study will evaluate the impact of the PT workshops using ethnographic techniques. Findings will reach the wider caregiving community through production of a video based on the workshops. With widespread shortages in health care workforces across the country, and high rates of turnover in frontline caregivers in particular, ethical communicative practices in health care workplaces, will have significant implications for the economics of health care."

Inadequate or excessive weight gain during pregnancy increases the risk of pregnancy complications and long-term risk of chronic health problems for both mother and baby. Historically, inadequate GWG represented a great health concern, but now, with the rise of overweight and obesity rates in Canada and worldwide, the proportion of women entering pregnancy with a higher Body Mass Index has significantly increased, which has translated into an increased risk for excessive GWG (approximately 56% in Alberta). The same shift from inadequate to excessive GWG has been observed among low-income women who have been found to be at a greater risk for excessive GWG, and parity-associated obesity. This project aims to promote maternal health through supporting attainment of appropriate body weight and optimal dietary intake, during pregnancy and postpartum, among low-income women who access Community-Based Organizations (CBOs), partially funded by the Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program in Alberta.
The research will use a knowledge translation framework to: 1) describe the web of factors that influence low-income women's body weights and diets during pregnancy and postpartum, 2) examine needs, gaps and opportunities within services currently delivered through CBOs during these vital life cycles, and 3) translate findings into practice by developing and implementing selected strategies that promote appropriate body weight and optimal dietary intake to pregnant and postpartum, low-income women in the context of CBOs. This project has the potential to improve maternal health by elucidating the complex web of factors that affect gestational and postpartum body weights, dietary intake and overall health. Given the importance of pregnancy for both women's and infants' health, this is a unique opportunity to positively impact the health of future generations."

Traditionally, setting these limits has been achieved by balancing individual and social responsibility for oral health. This approach has resulted in significant gaps for many groups, and is generally at odds with the position taken in most societies that access to health care should be based on need, not on the ability to pay or value judgements about individual responsibility.

Studies in the United States have found that immigrant youth born in another country were less obese than immigrant youth born in the United States. This study will look at the link between when a child's family immigrated to Canada and his or her level of obesity. Some risk factors that may shape this link will also be studied. One of these risk factors is stress from acculturation. Acculturation is the changes that happen when people from two different cultures are in contact with each other. It is often stressful, especially for young people, and this may lead to obesity. Acculturation to a Canadian way of life is another risk factor. Immigrant youth who take on a Canadian lifestyle may gain more weight than those who do not. This study will also look at socioeconomic status. Usually poorer people are more overweight, but immigrants are often poorer and less overweight. We will try to understand why this is. Last, we will look at ethnicity as a risk factor. Different ethnic groups may have different amounts of weight gain when they immigrate to Canada. We will look at all these things in youth aged 10 and 15 years. They will be divided into groups based on when their families immigrated to Canada. The youth and their parents will fill out surveys on these risk factors and get their height and weight measured. The statistical method of structural equation modeling will be used to examine all these relationships. This project is important because it will create new information about the health of immigrant youth in Canada.

Beyond being just a permanent skin mark, a scar can influence quality of life, and alter a person's view of themselves. However, healthcare providers often only assess a scar's physical features and functional consequences - asking only if a patient's scar is tight, itchy, or painful; not if a patient is embarrassed, upset, or unhappy with their scar. In children particularly, without probing, such feelings may go unrecognized and therefore unaddressed. In fact, the psychosocial impact of scars, and a scar's effect on body image have not been investigated. Thus, with clinicians largely blind to the mental and emotional aspects of scars, scar patients are inadvertently denied holistic care. This proposal aims to rectify this knowledge gap to catalyze clinical change.

This project measures the psychosocial impact of scars in children, determines factors affecting body image in children with scars, and evaluates the effect of scar therapy on body image and a scar's psychosocial imprint. Psychosocial impact is measured with the SCAR-Q - a new patient-reported outcome measure developed by our group to capture the patient perspective of scars. Body image is measured by the Body Esteem Scale for Adolescents & Adults (BESAA). Consented children with scars at The Hospital for Sick Children complete the SCAR-Q and BESAA before and after scar treatment (surgery, laser, compression) to uncover the psychosocial burden of scars, their body image, and the influence of scar therapy on these factors.

Characterizing the psychosocial significance of scarring and identifying its relevance to the health status of people with scars, will inform clinical practice. Specifically, the need for evaluating the psychosocial scar, alongside the physical scar would be emphasized. Ultimately, by understanding the mental, emotional, and social weight of scars, healthcare providers may better deliver patient-centred care to improve the overall health of those with scars."

The goals of this exploratory study are to gather preliminary data on aging non-Western immigrant's utilization of EOL care and to begin to document anon-Western immigrants' perceptions of EOL care. The rationale for this study is based on reports from palliative care managers in the two largest health regions in Saskatchewan that non-Western immigrants underutilize EOL care in their respective health regions. Study goals will be met by interviewing aging non-Western immigrants about their experiences accessing (or not accessing) EOL care and their perceptions about EOL and palliative care. Immigrants represent a considerably large group among senior citizens in Canada. In 2001, some 29% of persons aged 65 to 74 and 28% of those aged 75 to 84 were immigrants. China and India represent the top sources of immigration to Canada and Saskatchewan; over 11% immigrants from these countries have made their home in Saskatchewan in the past 20 years. This research is important because Canada is an aging country, and an increasing number of first generation immigrants from China and India may require end-of-life services. Aging immigrants represent a vulnerable population when it comes to accessing health care, most notably because language barriers are related to the underuse of health services and many first generation immigrants do not have English as a first language. No research exists on the utilization of end-of-life care among non-Western immigrants.Findings will provide a foundation for a more in-depth exploration of non-Western immigrants' perceptions and utilization of EOL care. Such research would benefit Chinese and Indian immigrants and their families living in Saskatchewan, and care providers in Saskatchewan and beyond, by increasing knowledge about accessibility to end-of-life care."
Anticipatory Distress to Immunization in Preschoolers,"['Racine, Nicole M']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,324421,"Children in Canada receive up to 20 needles before their second birthday. Many kids experience pain and distress from these needles. Some kids also experience fear before those needles. Understanding how much fear kids have before their needles will help us to design interventions so they are not so scared of needles. This study investigated fear and anxiety before needles in preschoolers. The study has three main aims: First we wanted to understand how much fear preschoolers have before a needle procedure, second, we wanted to investigate whether boys and girls differ in their amount of fear they have before a needle, and lastly we wanted to see whether parents and kids report the same amount of fear and worry before the needle. 

For this study we videotaped 202 preschoolers and their parent during their 4 year immunization. We transcribed these videotapes and coded what parents and children were saying. We found that before getting a needle, 53% of kids were showing some kind of distress. The most frequent kind of distress were saying they didn't want the needle, asking for information, or saying that it was going to hurt. Many children also cried and tried to push their parents or doctors away. Girls cried more than boys before the needle. Parents 'ratings of their child's worry was related to how much their kid said they didn't want the needle. Parents' who were more worried themselves, rated their children as being more worried.  

This study found that many kids are scared and upset before their needles, especially girls. Parents' worry may have an effect on their child's worry about needles. We need to do more research to understand these relationships."

We propose to conduct a series of interconnected studies that will establish a measure of reassurance seeking in OCD and that will experimentally manipulate a variety of factors which are proposed to contribute to repeated reassurance seeking (e.g., perceived threat and ambiguity of feedback) in clinical and nonclinical participants. Results from these investigations will be communicated to scientific, community and clinical populations and we expect that our findings will help to refine and improve psychological treatments for this complicated type of OCD."
Examining weight loss method engagement among young adults in Canada,"['Raffoul, Amanda']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,383159,"Weight loss attempts are common among young adults, and American studies show that the healthfulness of these behaviours differs by gender, weight, and race/ethnicity. Although public health policies encourage the use of healthful weight loss methods, using multiple and/or unhealthy behaviours has been associated with increased risks of weight gain and disordered eating.

In this study, we examined the prevalence of weight loss methods among Canadian young adults, and differences in use of these methods by demographic characteristics, health literacy, and perceived body size.

We explored data from the 2016 Canada Food Study, comprised of self-reported information from 3000 young adults in five cities. Linear regression models were conducted to investigate correlates of the number and type of weight loss methods used, categorized as 'dietary changes', 'physical activity', 'assisted weight loss methods', and 'unhealthy behaviours'.

Over half of the sample reported a weight loss attempt in the past 12 months, and nearly one fifth engaged in an unhealthy weight loss method. Women, individuals with non-binary gender identities, and individuals who perceived themselves as overweight or obese were more likely to engage in a greater number of weight loss behaviours across categories. Individuals with lower health literacy scores engaged in significantly fewer healthy weight loss methods and a greater number of unhealthy methods.

Although many young adults engage in healthier weight loss strategies, a concerning number use unhealthy weight loss methods. These findings are significant for public health initiatives striving to encourage engagement in healthy weight-related behaviours. Specific sub-populations engage in a greater number of unhealthful weight loss behaviours, highlighting the need for policies that target these high-risk groups."
Evaluating the prevention of disordered weight control behaviours among youth: Informing nutrition and mental health-related policy in Canada,"['Raffoul, Amanda']",['N/A'],"['Disordered Eating', 'Eating Disorder Prevention', 'Health Policy', 'Mental Health', 'Obesity Prevention', 'Population Health']",150000.0,412527,"Disordered weight control behaviours (DWCBs), such as self-induced vomiting, unhealthy calorie restriction, and the use of non-prescribed diet pills, are common among young Canadians. Youth who engage in DWCBs are at a greater risk of developing eating disorders, obesity, and mental illness in adulthood. As a result, the prevention of DWCBs is an important avenue for improving population health. This research aims to evaluate health policies relevant to the prevention of DWCBs among youth, with implications for eating disorders, obesity, mental health, and chronic disease risk overall. To address this aim, I will conduct three studies to identify and analyse, generate recommendations for, and evaluate DWCB prevention policies in Canada. First, a literature review will be conducted to assess current DWCB prevention policies at federal and provincial levels within the areas of education, nutrition, mental health, and body weight. The review will be used to identify existing DWCB-related policies and their potential effects on population health, and identify policy gaps. To identify strategies to these gaps, Canadian leaders in the fields of eating disorders, obesity, nutrition, and mental health will be asked to provide policy recommendations. Promising policies will be evaluated using a modelling approach that allows us to estimate the impacts on rates of DWCBs, eating disorders, and obesity on youth as they age. Overall, the results of these studies will provide information on existing policies that can be used to evaluate progress on DWCBs prevention and inform concrete recommendations to address gaps. Such policies are critical for reducing the negative impacts of DWCBs on Canadian youth."
Access to HIV treatment and prevention services and injection initiation among people who inject drugs in North America,"['Rafful Loera, Claudia']",['N/A'],"['Drug Policy', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Injection Drug Use', 'Mixed-Methods', 'Multilevel Analyses', 'North America']",135000.0,361809,"The increase in prescription opioid misuse and subsequent initiation of injection drug use (IDU) is a public health concern across North America (NA). IDU remains a key driver of the HIV epidemic in all three countries of NA. There is evidence that syringe distribution, supervised injection facilities and opioid substitution therapy are effective in preventing HIV transmission and may also decrease the initiation of other people into drug injection. Appropriate scale-up and expansion of such services varies across socioeconomic and geopolitical settings. It is therefore critical to have HIV services for people who inject drugs (PWID) tailored to respond to factors driving HIV transmission and injection initiation across diverse socioeconomic settings. The proposed project would therefore investigate the suite of available HIV services (i.e., testing, treatment, and prevention) for PWID in three different socioeconomic settings across NA: Tijuana, Mexico; San Diego, USA; and Vancouver, Canada. It will analyze how socio-structural services such as housing and access to welfare mediate HIV service uptake and HIV risk behaviors across settings. This project will also investigate the association between HIV service uptake and the risk that PWID initiate others into injection drug use. In addition, it will not only inform under-resourced settings on Canadian health policies but it will also inform efforts to optimize and scale up HIV services for underserved populations in low- and middle-income settings across North America that have been disproportionately impacted by IDU-driven HIV epidemics, including Mexico's northern border region as well as rural and remote indigenous communities in Canada."

These applications have used specific approaches such as Multi-Agent Based Modeling (MABS), Complex Systems, Intelligent Systems, and Decision Support Systems. This research will use and Artificial Intelligence (AI)  algorithm to simulate the risk of injury for children traveling in vehicles in Canada using the existing national child seat survey (Transport Canada) to model and simulate and predict the influence of culture, social policy (Road Safety Vision 2010), social marketing, and educational interventions designed to support accurate and safe use of child seats for Canadian children. Significant progress has already been made, a model of family knowledge and use of child seats has been developed that identifies the significant influence of culture on use of child seats.  This model captures the socio-economic and cultural aspects of society relative to use of child seats and child risk of injury in vehicles. The proposed computer modeling methodologies will explore the dynamic interaction of how and when families use child seats and how their culture influences learning and decisions to use child seats, booster seats and seat belts. This model will simulate child risk of injury when policy, education, or cultural factors are introduced into the ""artificial"" society to predict outcomes such as child risk of injury.  Artificial intelligence models are based on real world data, but permit the examination of how child seat use changes when opportunities for awareness, learning, legislation, enforcement are introduced ""artificially"" into the model.  The goal of this research is to build innovative Artificial Intelligence tools to aid and support policy, social marketing, and injury awareness and education programs."
Disclosing Incidental Findings in Pediatrics: Health Professional Perceptions and Insight,"['Rahimzadeh, Vasiliki N']",['N/A'],"['Ethics', 'Genetic Research', 'Incidental Findings', 'Pediatric Oncology']",1000.0,315390,"For decades, the pediatric oncology context has maintained a strong clinical research tradition. Research applications of next generation sequencing (NGS) are among the latest innovations that promise vast improvements in the nature and quality of pediatric cancer care. Yet ethical challenges persist in the disclosure of genetic information in this context, particularly the management of incidental findings. The information-generating capacities of NGS, and its widening use in pediatric cancer research, demand an anticipatory and multidisciplinary discussion on the ethics of disclosing incidental findings. The aim of this study is therefore to explore the perceptions and attitudes of investigators concerning the return of incidental findings in the pediatric oncology research context. Sixteen in-depth, qualitative interviews were conducted with leading investigators in pediatric oncology from across Canada. Results from our study reveal at least four contextual themes underlying the ethics of when, and how IFs could be disclosed to pediatric research participants and their families: clinical significance of the result, respect for individual, scope of professional responsibilities, and implications for the healthcare/research system."
Exploring women's perspectives of the multiple forms of violence against female garment workers in Bangladesh: A socio-ecological lens towards determining drivers and finding solutions,"['Rahman, Laila']",['N/A'],"['Bangladesh', 'Double Helix Model', 'Female Garment Workers', 'Gender Relations', 'Mixed Methods', 'Mulit-Level Analysis', 'Socio-Ecological Model', 'South Asian Workers', 'Violence Against Women', 'Workplace Violence']",105000.0,307725,"In Bangladesh, female garment workers experience violence and sexual harassment at work as well as at home, but we do not know how women give meaning to their experience of these multiple forms of violence. The cost of this violence is very high; and the health consequences, severe. Violence also transmits from one generation to the next. Therefore, I propose to study these multiple forms of violence using women's own perspectives as the basis of future interventions. 

This study will explore: what are women's experience of violence at home and at work; how do they feel about their experience of violence; what do they believe are the contexts and causes of this violence; what mechanisms help them to cope with violence; why women choose to seek and not to seek help; and finally, what actions can be taken at the community and at the workplace to reduce violence against women. Instead of looking at only one form of violence, the study will attempt to understand the broad spectrum of violence that women face in their daily life. 

To do this I will gather information from 630 female garment workers of Dhaka, Bangladesh using two approaches: (a) conduct one-to-one in-depth discussion with 30 women; and (b) ask specific questions to 600 female workers from 30 factories about their experience of violence. Analyzing these data will allow me to understand how women experience violence and what specific actions do they suggest to stop this violence. Finally, I will conduct workshops with women to develop programs that can reduce violence against women and lead towards building a non-violent society.

This study will inform us the challenges to body and health that Bangladeshi women face. Their own suggestions as to what interventions would be useful will allow us to design activities to reduce violence and improve the health of 3.6 million female workers in Bangladesh. The findings of this study will also be useful for other South Asian countries."
"Impact of osteoarthritis on developing co-morbid conditions and mortality in British Columbia, Canada","['Rahman, Md Mushfiqur']",['N/A'],"['Cardiovascular Disease', 'Cchs Data', 'Cox Ph Models', 'Diabetes', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Mortality', 'Osteoarthritis', 'Osteoporotic Fractures', 'Physical Activity', 'Population Data Bc']",105000.0,206195,"INTRODUCTION: Osteoarthritis (OA) in the hip or knee is very common and is the leading cause of long term disability in Canada. To date, we have very little understanding of the impact of OA on physical activity (PA) and its association with other conditions, such as heart disease, diabetes, and osteoporotic fractures, as well as mortality in general. The goal of this project is to better understand the relation of OA to these conditions, thus filling an important gap in knowledge on OA.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS: 1) Does OA reduce physical activity? 2) Does OA increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and osteoporotic fractures? 3) Are mortality rates in people living with OA higher than mortality rates in similar people without OA? 

RESEARCH PLAN: I will use health care data from the Population Data BC and the Canadian Community Health Survey data. The study has three parts. In the first part, I will investigate whether OA reduces physical activity. Secondly, I will estimate the risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, and fractures among individuals with and without OA. Finally, I will compare death rates in individuals with OA and those without OA. These findings will help the management of OA in terms of 1) assessment of the burden of OA, 2) development of preventive strategies and 3) optimization of medical and surgical treatments of OA.

SIGNIFICANCE: OA is one of the most common causes of pain and disability in Canada and often leads to reduced quality of life and work time. With the aging of the population, more people will suffer from OA. Because of this huge disease burden, it is very important to have a better understanding of the impact of OA on PA and conditions that are related to lack of PA such as heart disease, diabetes, fractures, and early death. The results may be used to develop new programs for patients with OA to remain active and new guidelines for physicians to prevent, detect, monitor and treat these conditions in such patients."

This method of disease ascertainment may result in large proportions of false negative and false positive cases. To correct for these errors in disease classification, a subsample of the study subjects may be contacted and asked to report their disease status and/or invited for a clinical assessment. Statistical methods using Bayesian approaches are then used to combine the information obtained on the disease from the full sample with that obtained from the subsamples to infer the true state of the disease for all study individuals. In this project, we will assess the performance of the Bayesian method in correcting for disease misclassification. First, we will generate data for the true state of a disease for a sample of individuals. Second, we will hide the true data for some of these individuals and assume that their disease status was wrongly recorded in the database. Third, we will apply the Bayesian method on the misclassified data to investigate whether it is able to reduce the misclassification proportions. Finally, we will apply the Bayesian method to the study of the association between statin use and risk of new-onset diabetes using a random sample of 6,247 Quebec individuals that we obtained from the Quebec health services administrative databases. Among these individuals, about half responded to a survey on diabetes status and about a quarter also provided fasting capillary blood samples for glucose testing."

Globally, the number of asylum-seekers is increasing, but many countries have enacted immigration, criminal justice or border enforcement policies and practices that criminalize migration to deter or punish asylum-seekers. At the Mexico-U.S. border, the criminalization of migration has not lessened the number of asylum-seekers waiting for the opportunity to seek safety in the U.S., but it has made conditions for asylum-seekers more unsafe. Asylum-seeking women at the Mexico-U.S. border face elevated risk of adverse sexual and reproductive health (SRH) outcomes, including unmet need for contraception, unplanned pregnancy, and potential HIV/STI exposures. These inter-related health outcomes may also be affected by other experiences during migration, such as high rates of sexual violence and limited access to sexual and reproductive healthcare. However, almost no research has investigated the pathways between the criminalization of migration and adverse SRH outcomes among asylum-seeking women. Evidence is needed in complex border environments, like the Mexico-U.S. border region, where asylum-seekers are languishing due to lengthy processing times, high rates of violence and exploitation, and severe gaps in humanitarian aid. To address these gaps, I will conduct 30 qualitative interviews and analyze existing epidemiologic data (N=250) collected at the Mexico-U.S. border with asylum-seeking women to identify their lived experiences and the pathways by which criminalization of migration impacts SRH outcomes. This study will provide urgently needed evidence to inform healthcare interventions and program planning to address the inter-related risks of unmet contraceptive need, unplanned pregnancy, and HIV/STI exposures among asylum-seeking women."

At this conference, I will present findings from my doctoral research study focused on weight bias and public health. Research indicates that public health obesity prevention initiatives often fail to recognize the complexity of obesity and that individuals with obesity perceive such initiatives as overly simplistic, disempowering and stigmatizing. We also know that obesity stigma can increase morbidity and mortality and produce health and social inequalities. My research engaged individuals with obesity and public health policy makers in a narrative inquiry to examine their experiences with obesity, weight bias and stigma. My findings indicate that there are tensions between narratives of public health professionals and the stories of people with obesity. Simplistic obesity prevention models do not align with the experiences of the people we are trying to reach through public health obesity prevention programs. People with obesity struggle with these approaches because they create oppressive social identities and impact their experiences with the public, the media, and health professionals. By sharing these obesity narratives at this conference, I want to encourage critical reflection on public health practice for obesity prevention and create possibilities for personal, practice and social change. I will also discuss strategies that can be used to eliminate narratives that create oppressive identities for people with obesity."
The impact of social position on the relationship between active travel use and body mass index in a sample of urban Canadians,"['Ramsay, Dana E']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,345815,"What is already known on this subject?

Interventions directed at obesity determinants can improve the health status of Canadians and reduce direct costs to our healthcare system. Regular physical activity is effective in the primary and secondary prevention of several chronic diseases, including obesity. Purposeful walking, cycling and transit use contribute to total physical activity and constitute a unique ""domain"" beyond leisure time physical activity. While the public health community is broadly supportive of policies to increase active travel, the limited evidence linking active travel to obesity reduction is in need of additional support. It is also unknown whether the health benefits of active travel are shared equally across socioeconomic groups. 

What does this study add?

Body mass index (BMI) was significantly associated with mode of travel, household income and neighbourhood-level deprivation. Household income had a modifying effect on the relationship between travel mode and BMI; lower BMI was observed for active only compared to vehicular only travelers in the three highest income categories. Active or multi-modal travel was not associated with BMI for low income people. The results of this cross-sectional study advance the hypothesis that social position may limit the opportunity to benefit from physical activity achieved from active travel. Active travel may be insufficient to overcome the additional barriers to healthy weight maintenance imposed by disadvantage among low income people. Consideration should be given to how interventions to increase active travel might exacerbate social inequalities in body mass index."

From these surveys, a number of prevention and management strategies have evolved in an attempt to enhance and integrate pathways to wellness including discussions about the non-traditional use of tobacco and air quality.  As a result the Green Light Program was co-created and implemented.  The aim of the Green Light Program is to increase the number of smoke-free homes in the community and thereby reduce the impact that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) has on health and wellness. In this project, the team will build on the current Green Light Program by integrating Indigenous ways of knowing and medicine with Western ways of knowing and patient-centred care.

Efforts have also been made to monitor India's maternal and child health indicators using large scale surveys. This research proposal will leverage the work of the Registrar General of India in collaboration with the Centre for Global Health Research that is producing the first estimates of cause-specific child mortality at the sub-national level by combining it with information from large scale sample surveys such as National Family Health Survey and District Level Household Survey that for the last decades has been collecting data on sub-national coverage of health interventions and prevalence of key health practices. The innovative and unique combination of these three impressive surveys will help India in identifying priority areas for action by contextualizing the barriers to child survival according to prevailing socio-cultural practices; quantifying the impact of targeted interventions by estimating the annual number of lives saved and estimating the impact that local action could have on India's national neonatal and child survival rates."

Of 1320 women, 80% (n=1055), experienced violence in adulthood, which is more than thirteen times the national average.  Experiencing trauma and violence often leads to the development of a new or worsening mental health conditions including depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Experiences of trauma are linked to worsening health outcomes including four times the rate of antiretroviral (ARV) failure for women with HIV. 
This project aims to highlight the importance of addressing healing from trauma and violence for women with HIV. It involves disseminating a non-nominal survey to women with HIV across Canada to ask them to identify what intervention would be meaningful for them in their health journey. This survey will be disseminated to women in rural and urban settings, and includes women who use drugs, Trans women, Indigenous women, women engaged in sex work, and women from African/Caribbean/Black (ACB) communities. We hope that this information will be utilized in the future to create tailored interventions for women living with HIV, which will ultimately lead to better health outcomes and an improvement in the care cascade for women with HIV.

Screening, or the early detection and referral of children with nutrition problems, is important in providing quality primary care.  NutriSTEP (Nutrition Screening Tool for Every Preschooler), a one-of-a-kind, parent-administered questionnaire, has been developed and is a provincially recognized program in Ontario, funded by the Ministry of Health Promotion.  The NutriSTEP program supports the establishment of preschool nutrition screening programs in Canada and other jurisdictions.  Research has shown that 8-22% of preschoolers are identified as being at high nutritional risk, based on NutriSTEP scores.  While the nutrition risk construct on which the NutriSTEP questions are based is likely similar for toddlers as for preschoolers, there are additional nutritional issues, such as weaning, use of table foods, juice and sweetened beverage consumption for toddlers that need to be considered for the development of a Toddler NutriSTEP.  Adaptation of the existing questionnaire will be conducted using the same methods as for the original development of NutriSTEP and include: focus groups with parents and consultation with experts to determine changes to or additions to current questions; development and refinement of wording of questions; and, finally, validation and reliability testing of the Toddler NutriSTEP.  This research will result in the availability of a Toddler NutriSTEP that can be disseminated through the existing channels for NutriSTEP."
Utilizing a Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) Approach to Adapt a Community Readiness Model to Gauge Readiness for Inuit-Specific HIV/AIDS Intervention,"['Rand, Jenny R']",['N/A'],"['Circumpolar Health', 'Community Based Participatory Research', 'Community Readiness Model', 'Disease Prevention', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Indigenous', 'Indigenous Research Methodologies', 'Inuit', 'Inuit Community Readiness', 'Sexual Health Promotion']",72000.0,317923,"There is a common misconception that HIV/AIDS is not a health concern in rural and northern Aboriginal communities (including Inuit communities), thus leading people to think they are not at risk. However, evidence suggests Inuit communities are not adequately captured in surveillance data on HIV, resulting in data not reflecting HIV infection rates within these regions. Given the elevated rates of other Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), unique sexual networks, high birth rates, limited testing, and stigma the risk of exposure to HIV among Inuit is high. Against this backdrop, there is little research to inform culturally relevant HIV prevention interventions with Inuit communities. The proposed doctoral research project aims to adapt a Community Readiness Model (CRM) to gauge community readiness for HIV prevention interventions. This project will work with Inuit communities from across the Arctic to formulate an Inuit-specific readiness tool for HIV/AIDS education, prevention and screening. The tool will identify stages of readiness which correspond to interventions that advance to higher levels of community readiness. It will enable Inuit communities to address HIV and other sexual health issues at a local level. Once adapted, the applicability and effectiveness of the CRM will be tested with select Inuit communities and the project Steering Committee. This research project will use Indigenous methodologies and community-based participatory research, to work in partnership with communities to create knowledge. This project will not only inform future interventions but will provide the communities with critical information in order to identify areas for capacity building for future community-engaged research. Ultimately, this project will provide valuable tools and knowledge for addressing sexual health and HIV that are relevant within individual community contexts, allowing communities to improve the health of Inuit now and for future generations."

This proposed research project will examine a CBPR project 'in action', in order to assess its alignment with Inuit ways of knowing, cultural and traditional expressions and examine ideas around decolonizing research approaches.
The results of this study will provide an in-depth understanding of how Western (Academic) and Indigenous (Inuit) ways of knowing interact within a CBPR study. This study will provide new knowledge about research that draws upon these two knowledge systems, and will provide insight to research processes, ultimately resulting in improved approaches to Inuit CBPR and improve Inuit health outcomes."

Inuit and Western Ways of Knowing in Academic Research: Examining IQ and Community-Based Participatory Research,"['Rand, Jenny R']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2800.0,364720,"This research project is situated within a larger HIV prevention focused community-based participatory research (CBPR) study taking place in three Inuit communities across Nunavut. Much of the literature surrounding CBPR strongly promotes this approach as a successful process for collaborative research between University-based researchers and Indigenous communities. However, missing from the literature is research specifically examining CBPR processes and Indigenous ways of knowing, their alignment, and if and how they work together. Drawing on the concept of Two Eyed Seeing, made known by Elder, Albert Marshall, this research project will examine a CBPR project in action, in order to assess the alignment of Inuit Qaujimimajatuqangit (IQ) and principles of CBPR. IQ refers to Inuit epistemology, or Inuit societal values that represent Inuit ways of knowing and doing past present and future. Study results will provide an in-depth understanding of how Western (Academic) and Indigenous (Inuit) ways of knowing interact within a CBPR HIV prevention research study. With no universities in Nunavut, academic research with Inuit communities in the territory must on a variety of levels navigate/ negotiate Inuit and non-Inuit ways of knowing. This project will ultimately produce knowledge for Inuit-specific research frameworks that will have great utility across disciplines. The findings from this research project will help to ensure Inuit ways of knowing are explicitly incorporated into research processes and will contribute to knowledge for both Inuit communities and University-based researchers to conduct culturally affirming research and lead to wise practices for community-placed and Inuit-led research."
Examining the use of Inuit knowledge within community-based HIV prevention research,"['Rand, Jenny R']",['N/A'],"['Community-Based Participatory Research', 'Hiv Prevention', 'Indigenous Methodologies', 'Inuit Health Research', 'Inuit Methodologies', 'Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit', 'Two Eyed Seeing']",1804.0,400346,"Inuit hold great knowledge, skills, and strength, all of which have sustained their people through some of the most rapid social, economic, and political changes ever experienced by Indigenous Peoples across the world. For Inuit this way of knowing is known as Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (IQ). Within health research, a shift has occurred and research with Indigenous communities is now expected to recognize (and include) Indigenous knowledge. 
An approach to research that claims to create space for upholding Indigenous ways of knowing is community-based participatory research (CBPR). Much of the literature surrounding CBPR strongly promotes this approach as a successful process for collaborative research between University-based researchers and Indigenous communities. However, missing from the literature is research examining CBPR processes and Indigenous knowledge, their alignment, and if and how they work together. To address this gap, using a case study approach and the conceptual framework of Two Eyed Seeing, this case study examined an HIV prevention CBPR project that took place with three Inuit communities across Nunavut.
Aiming to examine the congruency of IQ and CBPR principles, this case study sought to answer questions to determine in what ways these two sets of principles were reflected throughout the research process; what may be some challenges and opportunities of a CBPR project that follows IQ, and what the strengths of IQ as a guide for knowledge creation are. 
This case study produced knowledge for Inuit-specific research frameworks that has utility across disciplines. The findings from this research project can help ensure Inuit ways of knowing are explicitly incorporated into research processes and contribute to knowledge for both Inuit communities and university-based researchers to conduct culturally affirming research following Wise Practices for community-driven research."

Previous studies have demonstrated the association of MetS with the future development of leading causes of death, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes. This study will lay the evidence base for MetS in public health by first demonstrating the prevalence of MetS, it's association with subclinical disease, and the heightened projected rates of future disease among individuals with MetS. An analysis of the proportion of cases of CVD and diabetes that can be attributed to MetS, and the cost of illness incurred by MetS, will inform an examination of the burden of this pre-disease risk condition on Canadians. These two papers lay the foundation for a health promotion and knowledge translation analysis of chronic disease prevention and management. This final paper will review current efforts and suggest the use of MetS as a pluripotent risk indicator that can be targeted so as to prevent a broad range of chronic conditions. 

There are continued health disparities between vulnerable populations in Canada. Public health efforts should aim to prevent such disparities and achieve the best health for all. Given that the distribution of MetS between population subgroups is proportionate with the distribution of chronic diseases, we suggest that MetS is a potential equitable chronic disease prevention target. Furthermore, based on its association with a wide array of chronic diseases (CVD, diabetes, rheumatic diseases, schizophrenia, polycystic ovarian syndrome and chronic kidney disease), we suggest that MetS has the added potential to be a broad reaching prevention target. Consequently, this thesis aims to contribute to our knowledge about the potential role for MetS in public health prevention and policy."
The Impact of Secularization on the Prevalence and Incidence of Depression and Anxiety,"['Rasic, Daniel']",['N/A'],"['Anxiety Disorders', 'Causes Of Depression', 'Community Health', 'Longitudinal', 'Religion', 'Secularization']",17500.0,224306,"North American studies have consistently shown that depression is increasing, particularly among young women.  Anxiety disorders are also common and frequently occur together with depression.  Both depression and anxiety are associated with problems in relationships, poor work function, poor physical health and suicide.  While depression and anxiety occur as a result of biological, psychological and social factors, the rise in depression is believed by many to be the result of societal changes.  One major societal change that is thought to contribute to the rise in depression and persistence of anxiety disorders is the decline in religiousness among people in North America.  Religiousness is known to be a factor that can protect against the development of mental illness and religiousness has been shown to be declining in Canada.  This research will examine the relationship between religion, depression and anxiety among two generations of individuals from Atlantic Canada who were followed for up to forty years.  The research will further seek to determine the active ingredients of the protective effect of religion on depression and anxiety and may be informative to future programs to enhance Canadian's mental health."

We need to understand the neurobehavioral outcomes of Canadian children with PAE/FASD, how child/family-level and environmental factors and service utilization affect these outcomes, and how FASD affects the family. The goal of the proposed project is to conduct a follow-up study of Canadian children with PAE/FASD to examine: behavioral, mental health, adaptive and executive function outcomes; the affect of child/family-level and environmental factors and service utilization on these outcomes; and the impact of PAE/FASD on the family. Parents and teachers of children will complete questionnaires regarding the child's behavioral, mental health, adaptive and executive function and outcomes. Parents will also complete questionnaires measuring child/family-level and environmental factors, service utilization, and that impact of childhood disability on the family. We hypothesize that children with PAE/FASD will have poor neurobehavioral, which will decrease (indicating more deficits) over time and that child/family-level and environmental factors as well as service utilization will be directly related to these outcomes. Further, we anticipate that PAE/FASD will have a dramatic effect on the family of affected individual. This project has implications for the health of children with PAE/FASD in Canada. Understanding the outcomes of children with PAE/FASD, identifying child/family-level and environmental factors that are associated with positive outcomes and insight into the impact of FASD on the family are invaluable for improving treatment and resources for those affected by PAE/FASD."

Individuals with FASD also display adverse outcomes including behavior problems, mental health issues, delinquency, and substance abuse, as well as problems adaptive to society. The goals of the proposed project are to examine: 1) the pattern of hot and cool EF difficulties in children and adolescents with FASD compared to control children 2) how both hot and cool EF contribute to adverse outcomes; 3) whether EF can be improved with targeted cognitive interventions. Participants will include children and adolescents (aged 11 to 17 years) with FASD and non-exposed controls. They will complete tests of cool and hot EF and their parents/caregivers will complete various rating scales regarding the participants behavior. Next, two groups of children with FASD will receive a targeted intervention: one focused on working memory and one focused on self-regulation, the third group will serve as a waitlist control. We hypothesize that children with FASD will have deficits in both hot and cool EF, but that they will have greater impairment on hot EF measures. We also expect that EF (and particularly hot EF) will be associated with adverse outcomes in FASD. Finally, we expect that the EF interventions will lead to improvements in EF.

The goal of the proposed research is to improve knowledge mobilization related to water and to promote the safe consumption of drinking water by better understanding the facilitators and the barriers in the Sahtú communities of the NWT, with the aim to improve water governance.
The specific research aims are to set actions for the Promotion, Perception, Consumption, Monitoring and Knowledge of drinking water. Our objectives are to:
a)Improve knowledge about water and drinking water in the region to help rebuild trust of water by developing and promoting communication material (i.e., health and water, water quality, water governance, tap water best practices), which will also facilitate the interest in its governance. 
b)Gather traditional knowledge (TK) and assess its impacts on water practices and document how TK is beneficial to the water and health promotion and safe drinking water On-The-Land.  
c)Conduct and assess a pilot project to implement household potable tap water filters to improve the taste and odour of tap water with the aim to respect the preference of the population and remove barriers to tap water consumption.
d)Increase the capacity for water monitoring in the region via an On-The-Land workshop and monitoring initiative.
e)Co-create, validate, and evaluate a new Water Quality Index to facilitate the communication of the drinking water parameters to community members.
Safe drinking water in First Nations is a must. It is also essential to engage with communities to decrease inequities, and develop greater capacities for its governance. It is important to design effective public health strategies by understanding the perception of the issue, and improve the safe consumption of water in northern Canada."

Study Design: The Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) is a fully operational program for determining health indicators the Canadian population that is led by Statistics Canada. Statistics Canada has agreed to our proposal to collect data on musculoskeletal health in a population-based sample of 10,000 Canadians from 6 to 79 years of age. Participants will undergo peripheral quantitative computed tomography to assess muscle and bone characteristics at the lower leg, muscle function tests, as well as biomarkers of bone metabolism. The aims are (1) to develop reference data for key musculoskeletal parameters; (2) to assess the muscle-bone relationship in healthy subjects and (3) to assess the effect of common obesity on the muscle-bone relationship. Statistics Canada has agreed to contribute $5,700,000 to this project. 
Clinical Importance: These studies will improve tools to study muscle-bone interactions and identify factors that can be targeted for interventions. As CHMS makes raw data of all studies available to the Canadian scientific community, the present project establishes a research platform that can be accessed by multiple investigators in Canada."

At the same time, dogs have been a unique domestic animal with a special status within the Inuit culture throughout history, contributing to the wellness of Inuit communities.  The optimal for a better health of Inuit at their interface with dogs is to mitigate the threats related to dogs towards Inuit health while maintaining, and increasing whenever possible, the contribution of dogs on Inuit wellbeing.  To move forward this health optimal, we propose a participatory, community-based research-action approach based on the ecohealth principles.  Such methodological approach considers the issue as a whole with inter-related social, environmental, ecological, cultural, and health components.  Ecohealth has been promoted as an effective approach to deal with Aboriginal health issues in Canada.  With respect to the unique history and culture towards dogs in Inuit communities, we believe that an ecohealth approach can provide a useful avenue to look at the issue and to inform the appropriate solution for the long term.  Most importantly, the ecohealth approach is highly participatory by nature implying that the people and their representatives are part of the whole process, from defining the issue to implementing the solution collectively chosen and evaluating its impact.  The current proposal aims at initiating the enrolment and empowerment of leaders and members of some Nunavik villages for the project idea.  Its output will be the design of the ecohealth project commonly worked out by the research team and the interested community members and leaders."

Attacks, bites, injuries, sometimes death, and the transmission of deadly rabies and probably other microbes are part of the reality in Northern communities.  All these dog-related health issues are exacerbated by the lack of, or limited access to, veterinary services, the presence of free-roaming dogs and dog overpopulation, which remain chronic issues in Northern communities.
The project's ultimate goal is to improve the health and wellness of Inuit, Naskapi, Cree and Westerners living in Northern Canada by mitigating dog-associated health risks and by supporting the role of dogs on wellness in these Northern communities.  The Inuit, Naskapi, Cree and Western knowledges and perspectives on health and dogs will be mobilized during the course of the project as they are essential in contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the health effects at the human-dogs interface in the Northern communities and to inform the most successful sustainable interventions to protect human health and support human wellness.
The primary project outcome is the reduction of the dog-related threats to human health and wellbeing in the North (i.e., attacks, bites, potential rabies case management, death), as well as supporting the positive dog-related health and cultural roles following the implementation of community-based, sustainable solutions during the course of the project."

In Canada, sperm and egg donors often remain anonymous and the children born are often not told the truth about the way they were conceived. Most donor-conceived individuals cannot access medical information related to their donors that would allow them to have a full picture of their medical family history, or personal information that would assist them in completing their own sense of identity and in understanding where they came from. Some believe that donor conception is similar to adoption and that donor-conceived individuals are therefore discriminated against in comparison to adoptees who have legal rights to information about their biological origins. In addition, parents can choose whether or not to tell their children the truth, since birth certificates do not indicate the fact that the child was conceived with the help of a third party. This can lead to potential unplanned and often painful discoveries later in life. The current situation therefore raises many ethical issues.

Canada, like many other countries, is struggling to find the appropriate way to regulate donor conception. To make good decisions, we need to involve all stakeholders: researchers; clinicians and providers; agencies distributing sperm and eggs; policy makers and regulators; organizations that offer support and resources; and donor-conceived individuals, donors and their respective families. However, these various groups rarely have the opportunity to share knowledge and to engage in discussion. This two-day workshop will bring them all together and provide a unique and timely opportunity to explore research directions and to inform professional guidelines and public policy, with the goal of promoting the health and well-being of donor-conceived individuals and their families."

ASD manifests as challenges in social interaction, speech and nonverbal communication, often with restricted and repetitive behaviours. Why ASD occurs is not known, but is thought to be due to both genetic and environmental factors, including maternal metabolic factors like diabetes mellitus, obesity and high blood pressure, as well as infant factors like premature birth and low birthweight. The relation between pre-pregnancy maternal sugar levels and the risk of ASD is largely unknown, including among women without DM, who nevertheless, can have an elevated blood sugar level. Blood hemoglobin A1c is an inexpensive, readily available blood test that measures average blood sugar levels.
   We will use existing large healthcare datasets to study about 60,000 women who gave birth in Ontario from 2007-18, permitting us to follow each liveborn child to age 4 years. We intend to apply our findings to better understand if A1c can identify women at higher risk having a child with ASD, and potentially reduce the risk of these important outcomes. We have an experienced, cooperative team of scientists and clinicians, to ensure that the existing data are analyzed and interpreted in a meaningful manner. We will offer clinicians and scientists a novel, powerful, and clear expression of the interaction between pre-pregnancy A1c and factors like maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index, diabetes & high blood pressure, as well as infant birthweight and timing of birth."

Through a regional IFS survey with Indigenous peoples in urban and rural communities in northern Ontario, informal interviews with administrators of Indigenous health programs and case studies at two Aboriginal Health Centres delivering programming rooted in IFS practices and principles, the following key questions will be examined:  1. How can IFS be expressed as a concept of wellness to inform the development and delivery of health interventions for Indigenous populations?; 2. How do we measure the impacts of applying IFS practice and principles to health interventions?; 3. How are IFS principles and practices expressed in current interventions targeted towards Indigenous populations in northern Ontario?; And, 4.

Statin Use in a Population-Based Cohort of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Patients,"['Raymakers, Adam']",['N/A'],['Epidemiology'],1200.0,331874,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive and irreversible disease characterized by inflammation in the patients' airways.  Approximately 80% of COPD cases are associated with a patients' previous or current smoking status. COPD is also associated with several comorbidities including cardiovascular disease (CVD). This means that COPD patients are often prescribed statins in addition to their COPD therapy.  Recently, the understanding of the system wide effects of COPD has improved. Whereas COPD was thought only impact the lungs, new evidence suggests that there may be systemic inflammatory effects from COPD. These effects are thought to negatively affect patients' health outcomes. There is additional evidence to suggest that statins might confer benefits to patients' by reducing systemic inflammation thereby improving health outcomes for COPD patients. The objective of this study is to test this idea by looking at patients' hospitalizations and survival.
This study uses population level data for the province of British Columbia to evaluate the effect of statin use among COPD patients on hospitalizations and mortality. This data comprises demographic information, hospital discharges, and prescription records for all residents of British Columbia. COPD patients were identified by using their prescription records to identify medications used as treatment for COPD. Adherence to statin treatment was also calculated. 
Using the method above, we identified 38 300 COPD patients. Of these, 10 384 were newly prescribed a statin. Forty-nine percent of patients were considered adherent to their medication. The results suggest that statins reduce the risk of hospitalization for a COPD related cause by 17% and for any cause by 37%. Moreover, statin therapy appears to reduce mortality for lung-related causes by 60% and for any cause by 35%.
Statin use in COPD patients appears to benefit patients by reducing the risk of hospitalization and improving survival."
Cognitive Processes Underlying Increased Vulnerability to Stress,"['Raymond, Catherine']",['N/A'],"['Attentional Bias', 'Cognitive Vulnerability', 'Cortisol', 'Early Life Adversity', 'Mind Wandring', 'Stress', 'Stress Hormones', 'Trier Social Stress Test']",105000.0,347993,"Two individuals face the same potentially stressful situation.  One individual reacts to the situation by releasing stress hormones (e.g. cortisol) while the other individual stays calm and do not produce these hormones. The chronic activation of the physiological stress response in the first individual may lead to physical and psychological problems in the long run, while no impact will be observed in the second individual. For the last three decades, scientific research on human stress has tried to understand the various mechanisms underlying the important inter-individual differences in reactivity to stress, and to determine which factors can significantly increase reactivity to stress in some individuals. We now know that factors such as sex, age, genes, and poverty can lead to increased reactivity to stress in humans. Although these factors are noteworthy, most are essentially unmodifiable. Interestingly, the majority of studies now show that exposure to early adversity is a significant predictor of increased vulnerability to stress in adulthood. The goal of my PhD projects is to test whether some cognitive processes (notably mind wandering and attentional biases) known to be sensitive to early adversities can predict increased reactivity to stress in adult humans. If I can show that cognitive processes sensitive to early adversity are significant predictors of increased vulnerability to stress in humans, I will then offer potential avenues for treatment. Indeed, cognitive processing is amenable to change through guided cognitive interventions and consequently positive results on my PhD could open the door to new forms of cognitive therapy for stressed individuals of all ages."
Échange de connaissances suite à deux synthèses sur les meilleures politiques pour réduire les inégalités sociales de santé : «Synthèse de connaissances sur les politiques des pays nordiques qui contribuent à réduire les inégalités sociales de santé» et «Synthèse de recherche sur les collectivités viables nordiques et leurs caractéristiques favorisant la santé dans l'équité»,"['Raynault, Marie-France', 'Massé, Richard']",['N/A'],"['Appropriation Des Connaissances', 'Café Scientifique', 'Grand Public', 'Inégalités Sociales', 'Inégalités Sociales De Santé', 'Milieux Citoyens', 'Pays Nordiques', 'Politiques Publiques', 'Équité En Santé']",16436.0,284046,"Selon l'OCDE, les écarts entre riches et pauvres ne cessent de croître dans ses pays membres et les mécanismes de répartition de la richesse sont de moins en moins efficaces, en particulier au Canada. Aujourd'hui, le Canada compense moins les inégalités que la majorité des pays de l'OCDE. Ces dernières années, de nombreux écrits scientifiques ont fait état des effets sanitaires de ces inégalités. Les inégalités sociales de santé (ISS) sont des différences de santé systématiques entre les groupes socio-économiques, écarts socialement construits et donc, évitables. Les pays nordiques (Suède, Norvège, Finlande, Danemark) se distinguent par de faibles taux d'inégalités et d'ISS. Notre projet consiste à disséminer les résultats de deux recherches portant sur les politiques sociales et les politiques de développement durable de ces pays et sur leur impact potentiel sur la santé. Nous prévoyons: 1- organiser un café scientifique bilingue pour présenter au grand public ces politiques, exposer ensuite nos résultats de recherches,  et terminer sur les implications pour la pratique de la santé publique au Canada;  2- diffuser l'enregistrement de ce café sur plusieurs plateformes; 3- Comme notre travail initial été réalisé en français, nous prévoyons aussi le rendre accessible en anglais.
Il importe que soient discutées les meilleures pratiques, non seulement au niveau des décideurs qui ont la responsabilité de façonner l'intervention de l'état dans la réduction des inégalités sociales, mais aussi au niveau du public en général, dont la sensibilisation aux politiques favorables à la santé est cruciale pour leur adoption ainsi que pour leur mise en application. Le café scientifique est une formule établie, permettant de rejoindre les citoyens intéressés par une problématique dans un cadre convivial et de leur permettre d'interagir directement avec les chercheurs et les parties prenantes de l'appropriation des résultats de la recherche."
Évaluation d'impact sur la santé de modifications du programme d'aide sociale du Québec,"['Raynault, Marie-France', 'Massé, Richard']","['Sylvestre, Marie-Pierre']","['Aide Sociale', 'Environnement Social', 'Grossesse', 'Inégalités Sociales De Santé', 'Pauvreté', 'Politiques Publiques', 'Périnatalité', 'Revenu', 'Santé Publique', ""Évaluation D'Impact Sur La Santé""]",81124.0,315266,"Depuis les années 1980, les études des liens entre pauvreté et mauvaise santé se multiplient et dégagent un portrait clair au point où, en 2008, la directrice de l'Organisation mondiale de la santé affirmait que « les inégalités sociales tuent à grande échelle ». Si les effets sont indéniables, il reste cependant plusieurs questions qui méritent réponse. Parmi ces questions, celle du niveau de revenu où ces dommages se manifestent reste encore largement inexplorée. Pour des raisons éthiques évidentes, on ne peut en effet intervenir sur le niveau de revenu des familles à des fins scientifiques. Les chercheurs doivent donc être à l'affut des modifications au revenu des familles au bas de l'échelle qui se produisent sur le terrain et étudier soigneusement leurs impacts. 
Au printemps 2013, le gouvernement québécois annonçait des modifications au programme d'assistance emploi qui visaient notamment les familles biparentales d'enfants de cinq ans et moins. Ces nouvelles mesures supprimaient la prime octroyée pour compenser le surcroit de difficultés qu'encourent ces parents de jeunes enfants lorsqu'ils veulent retourner sur le marché du travail. Une prime moindre et conditionnelle à l'inscription dans un programme du ministère de l'Emploi et de la Solidarité sociale était alors prévue pour une période de 6 mois. Ces modifications sont entrées en vigueur en septembre 2013 entraînant une diminution de revenus des familles prestataires ayant des enfants d'âge préscolaire.
Cette étude vise à évaluer l'impact de ces nouvelles mesures sur la santé des femmes enceintes et des nouveaux-nés défavorisés sur le territoire de l'Île de Montréal qui compte la plus grande proportion d'assistés sociaux au Québec. Nous nous intéressons aux issues défavorables de grossesse et comparerons la situation qui prévalait avant l'introduction des changements avec celle qui a suivi. Nous recueillerons aussi l'opinion des prestataires d'aide sociale sur ces changements au programme."
How Suggestibility May Influence Placebo Response: Insights From a Novel Experimental Design,"['Raz, Amir']","['Anbar, Ran', 'Ernst, Pierre-Paul', 'Kimmelman, Jonathan', 'Kirmayer, Laurence J', 'Kirsch, Irving', 'Zhu, Hongtu']","['Asthma', 'Attention', 'Cognition', 'Expectation', 'Placebo', 'Suggestion']",410000.0,200800,"While placebos are known to exert powerful therapeutic effects on some patients, we still have a poor understanding of the
mechanisms which underlie them, as well as the characteristics of placebo responders. A leading explanation for placebo
effects emphasizes the role played by patients' expectations. While we know that expectations can be produced or changed
more easily in people who are susceptible to suggestion, the role of suggestibility in placebo response is not understood.
Employing the pharmacological treatment of asthma as a model, the present study uses a novel experimental approach to examine
whether highly suggestible individuals exhibit a stronger placebo effect than less-suggestible persons. On two separate occasions, each research subject will receive a pharmacological treatment
for asthma under two conditions: once while the treatment is administered openly, and once while the subject is unaware that
the administration is taking place. If there is a difference in the treatment's effects under these two conditions -- a placebo
effect -- we can attribute it to the patient's knowledge that therapy is occurring. In other words, this experimental design will
allow us to measure the degree to which individual research subjects are responsive to placebo. This approach will permit us to answer important question -- for example, should certain individuals be more amenable to psychological intervention than others? -- and allow us to characterize parameters contributing to good placebo response, and will likely pave the road to a greater understanding of placebo phenomena."

Since the emergence of COVID-19, the focus of the research community in AI is mainly related to dealing the COVID-19 crisis. For that, the AI community has contributed a lot in developing early detection, forecasting, event-based surveillance, and vaccine advancement models.  Recently, we see the impact of COVID-19 on the psychological and societal well-being of the population, for example, the prolonged exposure to stress, hunger pandemic, unemployment, anxiety, suicide, and domestic abuse. The fellow's goal to evaluate post-COVID-19 impacts on various societal and individual factors aligns well with PHO's mission to enable informed decisions and actions to protect and promote health and contribute to reducing health inequities. The fellowship will contribute to the development of a collaborative COVID-19 data repository for interdisciplinary research. The fellow will also address the COVID-19 data misinformation.

Aboriginal public health competencies: Research results and knowledge dissemination,"['Reading, Jeffrey L']","['Greenwood, Margo L']","['Aboriginal Public Health', 'Core Competencies', 'Cultural Safety', 'International Indigenous Health']",25000.0,257725,"Indigenous populations around the world struggle with considerable health inequities compared to their non-Indigenous counterparts. These populations include the First Nations, Inuit and Métis, recognized in the Constitution Act of Canada 1982, Section 35. Although efforts to mitigate Indigenous health disparities and improve the quality of Indigenous health services are widespread, the cultural appropriateness of these programs varies. Indigenous cultural safety in health care is a concept that acknowledges historic tensions between Western and Indigenous cultures and teaches practitioners to respectfully integrate the culture and health beliefs of an Indigenous individual/community into health interventions. A group of Aboriginal scholars from Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States propose that a set of international core competencies for Indigenous public health be developed to promote the widespread practice of Indigenous cultural safety. These scholars are part of an established collaboration called CIPHER: Competencies for Indigenous Public Health, Evaluation and Research. The core competencies would be a set of skills, knowledge and attitudes that a culturally safe public health professional must master. To assess current cultural safety practices, an environmental scan of the public health education programs, Indigenous health services and cultural safety initiatives in each of the CIPHER countries was conducted. The findings of the scan are detailed in a comprehensive report, which includes recommendations for the CIPHER collaboration. The purpose of the proposed dissemination activities is to inform Indigenous public health stakeholders and CIPHER scholars of the environmental scan findings.  The proposed knowledge translation meeting for CIPHER scholars and stakeholder representatives is expected to produce a detailed research agenda and initiatives for designing and implementing effective core competencies for Indigenous public health."

The institute will begin with an opening prayer from a distinguished Elder and acknowledgement of the traditional Coast and Straits Salish territory where the institute will be held. On the evening of May 6th, there will be a keynote presentation, a feast with traditional foods and performances by First Nations dancers, drummers and singers. These activities provide participants with an introduction to local First Nations culture and an opportunity to build professional networking capacity. Each morning, the institute focuses on dissemination of new knowledge from Aboriginal health research and projects. Guest speakers give presentations on their areas of expertise, covering a wide range of health topics. Each afternoon, participants are divided into groups. The groups remain the same day to day and each group is assigned two facilitators. The groups are guided through discussion of the morning's presentations, which fuels the development of each group's proposal for a community based research project or health promotion program. The group projects ensure participants comprehend the new knowledge presented by guest speakers and practice the process of knowledge translation to improve Aboriginal health. On the final day, each group presents their research or project proposal before a panel of Aboriginal health experts, who ask questions and provide feedback. Each group also takes a turn at critiquing another group's project. This final activity allows participants to exchange ideas, evaluate each other's knowledge translation processes and identify the new knowledge and skills they have developed. To encourage further knowledge dissemination, translation and capacity building in Aboriginal health, all presentation and project materials from the Summer Institute will also be available on the Centre website."

Transportation and other logistical barriers are often cited in the Aboriginal and rural health literature, however little work has been done to measure the true impact of these costs on health services utilization in a rural First Nations population.  Using survey and administrative data in a natural experiment framework, the study will explore the effects of transportation costs on the following: number of medical appointments scheduled; attendance at scheduled appointments; follow-up care; overall utilization; and perceived health status.  The in-depth localized knowledge generated will support evidence-based decision making in the region and inform future research of the relative importance of transportation barriers compared to other barriers to accessing health services."
Ethical partnerships with transGender And Gender diverse communities for conducting pharmacoEpidemiologic research (EnGAGE),"['Rebic, Nevena']","['Brotto, Lori Anne', 'Cragg, Jacquelyn J', 'De Vera, Mary A', 'Law, Michael R', 'Malta, Monica']","['Administrative Health Data', 'Medication Adherence', 'Participatory Research Design', 'Patient-Oriented Research', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Population-Based Studies', 'Sex And Gender Analysis', 'Transgender Health Research']",19740.0,460978,"HEALTH PROBLEM: Even though transgender and gender diverse people are more likely to have poorer mental and physical health, they face more barriers to getting the care they need. Likewise, the lack of health research about transgender individuals makes it challenging to address their care needs. 

Many Canadians rely on prescription medications to help manage their health and treat diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis. For medications to work, they need to be taken as prescribed which can be a challenge for many patients. We know that transgender people have unique health and medication needs, especially as they grow older. Yet, research on medication taking and how it affects health outcomes among transgender individuals is rare.

PLANNING SOLUTION: We aim to fill the transgender health data gap on medication taking through partnering with community stakeholders to develop research questions and priorities informed by the transgender community. First, we will review how sex and gender have been included in the available evidence on medication taking. Following, we will develop collaborations with Canadian patient, researcher, community, and institutional stakeholders through a series of planning activities. We will organize individual and group meetings with stakeholders to develop guidelines for collaboration, discuss research priorities, and design potential research studies. At the end of the year, we will hold a symposium to publicly showcase the impact of our planning activities, share insights on the collaborative process, and discuss plans for future research and advocacy collaborations. To widely share lessons learned by our team, we will create practical tools for researchers on developing ethical research partnerships with key stakeholder groups in the transgender community.

IMPORTANCE: Our planning activities will contribute to the design of transgender health research that is informed by the transgender community."

Post-concussion symptoms can have a significant impact on youth participation in daily activities and overall health. To improve health outcomes of youth we must provide them with the tools and resources to recognize that they have had a concussion and how to manage their injury. The 'Concussion & You: Peer Educators in Action' program aims to meet this need. 

This program will enable Canadian high school students to engage in three components to raise concussion knowledge, awareness and reporting behaviour: 1) Concussion Awareness Council - champion students will be trained and supervised to deliver educational resources to classmates; 2) peer-led Concussion Awareness Campaign - champion students will be coached to develop and run an annual awareness campaign using creative approaches; 3) peer-led Concussion Awareness Campaign Showcase - awareness campaigns completed by students will be celebrated at an annual 'virtual' event. This project aims to: 1) share concussion knowledge, raise awareness and improve concussion reporting behaviours amongst Canadian high schools; 2) explore the impact of a peer-led service learning approach. 

This program will be supported by the development of an online Concussion Awareness Toolkit and Web Portal. During the study, this toolkit/web portal will provide a platform to share knowledge with and support participating high schools. After the study, this toolkit/web portal will be made available to the general public to allow for broader access to evidence-based, relevant and engaging concussion education and awareness materials, and to promote the sustained delivery of peer-led concussion education in Canadian high schools.

This project will provide insight into how to best raise concussion awareness and improve concussion reporting behaviours in high school students and provide a foundation for a much needed national strategy."

Comprised of nearly 80% women across Canada, this is especially the case for public safety communications personnel (PSCP). This is perhaps not surprising given: 1) sex and gender differences in the development of PTSD; 2) the unique nature of their work that includes responsibility for the safety of frontline personnel and the public, interactions with highly distressed individuals, intense organizational scrutiny, an unrelenting pace, and prolonged concentration and; 3) the paramilitary structure and culture of their organizations that include an imperative for workers to remain emotionally neutral, calm and in control. Thus, this research project seeks to determine the influences of gendered workplace experiences, organizational culture, and emotional demands, on physiological stress response and post-traumatic stress in PSCP following traumatic exposure in the workplace. Using a naturalistic, cross-sectional design, we will integrate primary physiological, observational, and survey data in order to further understand and model the complex relationships between gender-based stress, emotional labour, workplace culture, and physiological stress response (heart rate variability, salivary cortisol and oxytocin), and the development of posttraumatic stress among PSCP. The outcomes of the proposed study will a) further theoretical models regarding the relative influence of biological, psychological, sociocultural and occupational influences on post-traumatic stress; b) inform public policy with respect to workplace health and safety; and c) inform organizations regarding job design and employee support services."
New concepts in discrete choice preference measurement: an application to drug treatment for juvenile idiopathic arthritis,"['Regier, Dean A']",['N/A'],"['Methods', 'Preference-Based Utility', 'Quality Of Life', 'Willingness To Pay']",1500.0,253717,"Objective:
Advancements in the estimation of discrete choice experiment (DCE) data allow for the quantification of individual-specific utility or quality of life values. With a view to improve the validity of DCE-derived estimates of parents' willingness to pay (WTP) for a quality of life gain, we investigate incorporating a choice certainty question into the elicitation and estimation of DCE data.
Approach: 
The DCE elicited parents' preferences surrounding drug treatment for juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Parents chose between two alternatives differing on 6 attributes: drug administration, child reported pain, participation in activities, side-effects, school days missed, and drug cost. Respondents rated their certainty for each choice on a Likert scale (very uncertain to very certain). A mixed logit model allowed estimation of individual-specific utility values. Respondents' choice certainty was incorporated into the model by re-weighting the likelihood function. The D-error metric was used to investigate improvement in precision. Monte Carlo simulation techniques were used to generate WTP estimates.
Results:
105 parents of children with JIA at The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, completed 16 choice and choice-certainty questions. The D-error statistic demonstrated a 53% gain in efficiency with the choice certainty approach.In the standard approach, the mean WTP for a child who moved from responding inadequately to methotrexate and adequately to etanercept was $2,105 per month; 95% of the simulated individual-level WTP estimates fell between $360 and $12,743. When choice certainty was accounted for, mean WTP was $2,167 and 95% of the simulated individual-level estimates were between $405 and $11,866.
Conclusion:
Parents' of children with JIA are willing to pay $2,167 per month to improve children's well-being. The choice certainty approach improved the precision of the individual-level population WTP estimates."
Influence of Acculturation on body esteem and disordered eating in Afro-Caribbean women in Canada,"['Regis, Chantal M']",['N/A'],"['Acculturation', 'Afro-Caribbean Women', 'Body Esteem', 'Body Image', 'Disordered Eating']",17500.0,199808,"Disordered eating (dieting, fasting, and bingeing) is prevalent in a large proportion of young women in North America. Disordered eating and negative body esteem are known to be precursors to more severe forms of eating pathology and clinically defined eating disorders. This study seeks to investigate the relationship between acculturation and body esteem on disordered eating in Afro-Caribbean woman in Canada. The cultural diversity of Canada continues to increase as the population of ethnic minorities grows. Acculturation is the process of cultural and psychological change that takes place as a result of contact between two or more cultural groups. An individual's degree of cultural maintenance verses, the degree of involvement in larger society determine the acculturation strategy employed.  I hypothesize that type of acculturation strategy will predict levels of disordered eating in Afro- Caribbean women such that, women who pursue greater involvement in wider Canadian society will show greater levels of disordered eating than women who pursue cultural maintenance. Research in this area can enhance our understanding of the socio-cultural factors that impact the aetiology of disordered eating behaviour. More specifically, investigate the existence of culturally unique risk, or protective, factors that influence the development of disordered eating attitudes and behaviours in ethnically minority women.  Research in this area will contribute to psychological assessment and treatment that is culturally sensitive to cultural differences in the development of pathological eating behaviour and attitudes."

Stigma related to mental illness and substance use problems (MISUP) is a human rights issue and may cause problems finding employment and housing, which can ultimately lead to social isolation. Like the general public, health care providers may also stigmatize and discriminate which can reduce the quality of care provided. Evidence shows that individuals seeking help for MISUP feel disrespected and discriminated against by healthcare workers, making stigma and discrimination a critical barrier to seeking help, receiving quality health care and continued use of services.

The majority of stigma research has taken place in the global north. Little is known about stigma from the perspectives of people with lived experience and health care providers in Brazil. Even less is known about best practices for addressing stigma and discrimination in Brazilian health care settings, making it a high priority research area. This grant will be used to fund three components aimed at planning and dissemination activities. The overall goal is to lay the foundation for developing a research proposal to strengthen stigma research in Brazil. 

1. Stakeholder Consultations - Interviews with stakeholders will be used to provide insights on stigma towards individuals with MISUP in Brazil. Suggestions for developing an intervention targeting health care providers will also be collected.
 
2. Environmental Scans of Primary Health Care Centres - Scans of selected health care centres will provide information regarding existing policies, practices and programming. 

3. Symposium for Knowledge Users - Previous research findings, information from stakeholder consultations and insights from the environmental scans will be disseminated to key stakeholders.

Accordingly, there is a need to expand treatment coverage for alcohol use disorders, especially for populations which face barriers to receiving treatment. 

The objective of this proposed project is to develop a digital health worker, named PAHOLA, which can effectively deliver interventions to people who would not otherwise receive such treatment. To achieve this objective, the following research aims will be addressed:

1.To develop a digital human-based intervention that can initiate change processes and reduce alcohol use by applying the principles of motivational interviewing (MI) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) in a credible manner.

2.To assess the impact of the virtual care provided by PAHOLA on health outcomes using a randomized controlled study design (RCT) to assess potential effect sizes for a larger future RCT.

If successful, the PAHOLA project has the potential to transform our ability to prevent alcohol-attributable harms in Canada by promoting health, health equity, and well-being, especially among those people who do not normally receive treatment for harmful alcohol use."

The consequences of GBV are devastating. Women who experience GBV can develop immediate, acute, long-term & chronic health problems, including mental, physical, sexual & reproductive disorders. GBV is also associated with substance abuse, PTSD, depression, anxiety & suicidal tendencies.

Most research in South America & the Caribbean has focused on understanding GBV as a problem. Little is known about the obstacles encountered by Guyanese health, police & legal professionals when addressing GBV. Less is known about best practices for treating GBV in Guyanese health care settings, making it a priority research area. Funding for a 2-day Symposium bringing together key Knowledge Users actively working on GBV in Guyana will serve three objectives:

1.Research Dissemination: Disseminating findings from the UN Women's Health & Life Experiences Survey to a broad range of knowledge users who will be asked to provide recommendations for implementing findings and developing knowledge translation products. 

2.Consultations with Key Knowledge Users: Implications of research findings, challenges accessing & providing GBV treatment & supports will be considered for each sector. Suggestions for a multi-sectoral approach to educate, prevent, address & treat GBV in Guyana will be discussed. 

3.Planning for Future Research: Key knowledge users & international partners will develop collaborative, culturally-relevant, multi-sectoral implementation research ideas which address obstacles to accessing health care services as well as other supports for violence against women."

These factors limit the ability to accurately assess the magnitude of Ecuador's alcohol use. Accordingly, consultations with key stakeholders concerning alcohol consumption, harms measurement, and policy formulation and adoption of such policies which can reduce the harmful consumption of alcohol can help address research gaps and are crucial for guiding the development and implementation of alcohol policy initiatives. This planning grant will support meetings with stakeholders representing community members, healthcare providers, and government officials, with the goal achieving the following aims: 

1)to make an inventory and discuss data sources used to measure the patterns of alcohol and data sources used to measure the health harms due to alcohol consumption in Ecuador, 
2)to discuss current Ecuadorian alcohol policies and to create a report of synthesized findings for dissemination to stakeholders, and 
3)to develop a full-scale grant proposal. The proposed project aligns with the roadmap of CIHR, specifically with research priority C, by focusing on prevention of the harms caused by alcohol through improved monitoring and surveillance. 

This work will bring to the forefront alcohol consumption and alcohol-attributable health harms, and will create a network of researchers, policy stakeholders, and policy makers to identify knowledge gaps and research priorities in alcohol research and to determine how best to address these gaps and priorities in a resource-limited setting."

The OCRINT team has demonstrated success in conducting meaningful community and academic research, translating knowledge into practice and bringing it back to the communities affected, and working collaboratively with many diverse stakeholders. OCRINT research efforts to date has led to the identification and implementation of sound evidence-based solutions to substance use issues across Ontario and Canada. OCRINT will continue to develop and advance the evidence base regarding the social and environmental determinants of substance use and related harms across Canada through collaborative and best practice strategies in science, including engagement with a diverse group of key stakeholders. For the second phase of OCRINT's research program, we have identified, via membership consultations with our team, research priorities and gaps in several areas related to innovative models for substance use treatment within remote communities; prevention and harm reduction approaches among youth; exploring neighborhood perceptions of harm reduction services in Ontario; examining extended-release OAT formulation, treatment, and related outcomes among correctional populations; addressing substance use within Indigenous communities; and, program evaluations to assess clinical, programmatic and policy innovations. A notable component of the phase two of OCRINT research program will be the development of a regional strategy to enhance engagement with Indigenous communities across Ontario to expand the reach and impact of Indigenous engagement in all Ontario-specific Node activities.  OCRINT's proposed projects will continue to be guided by principles of equity, diversity, inclusion, including the importance of sex and gender."

The network will be launched on a webpage and will provide parents with access to information and resources on relevant health issues like nutritional and physical literacy as well as policy advocacy. In addition, the network will facilitate communication with other parents, stakeholders and health professionals so that entire communities can come together to advocate for policies that support the health and wellbeing of all families. The purpose of this project is not to advocate for this community, but rather, to empower individuals to advocate for themselves and their children."

Ikponwosa Ero, the UN Independent Expert on the enjoyment of human rights by persons with albinism, invited us to support her mandate with our research expertise on equity and global health.   
In findings from our subsequent research on human rights, mothering and albinism in Tanzania, South Africa, and Ghana, mothers who had given birth to a child with albinism recounted being stigmatized and abandoned by birth attendants, families, and communities. Our findings also revealed that while midwives and nurses are the most common birth attendants, they receive very little or no education about the albinism, despite its high prevalence in many parts of Africa. This knowledge gap left birth attendants reliant on widespread misunderstandings and stigmatizing myths about albinism.  
Building on our program of research, this case study will concentrate on health professions education for perinatal care of parents of infants with albinism. Specifically, the purpose of this case study is to examine how health professions education in regard to perinatal care for families impacted by albinism can be strengthened through intersectoral partnerships (between civil society, healthcare professions education programs, service providers, and policymakers) and the development of contextually relevant educational strategies (curricula, competencies, best practice guidelines, teaching resources). Our aim is to protect the human rights of persons with albinism, including their welfare and security, social determinants of health, and gender equity."

Unfortunately, many traditional parenting programs have focused on helping parents to manage these behaviours through reactive parenting, rather than to decipher them through reflective relationship-based parenting. Groundbreaking studies in the US, built on years of attachment research and the more recent field of interpersonal biology, have demonstrated the effectiveness of Circle of Security, a relationship-based parenting program. The 20-week version of this innovative parenting program has been tested in three studies with at-risk parent populations, including incarcerated mothers. The findings showed a reduction in insecure attachment between at-risk mothers and their young children. A more scalable Circle of Security 8-chapter DVD-based manualized program is now available. Originators of the program travel worldwide to provide 4-day trainings and have been to several Canadian cities with further trainings scheduled for 2014. As the uptake of Circle of Security (COS) parenting programs increases in Canada, there is an opportunity to evaluate the effectiveness of this shorter version; a research initiative fully supported by the program's originators. The need to design an evaluation protocol and train more registered COS facilitators is central to developing capacity for evaluation and broader implementation. Bringing together a team of researchers, knowledge users and collaborators, who have vision and expertise to evaluate COS parenting programs already in place in urban primary and secondary care settings, is the aim of this timely meeting grant. Including care providers and program planners from new primary care rural settings as well as from agencies caring for children with complex health needs will provide a breadth of study populations with which to apply the research protocol developed through this project in a future intervention study."

In the last decade, a sharp increase in the prescription of these drugs, particularly in combination with opioids, has been observed in North America and in Europe. Although GABAs are generally thought to be safe, Health Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration released warnings in 2016 and 2019, respectively, that these drugs when used alone or in combination with opioids may cause serious breathing problems, particularly in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD is a severe chronic respiratory condition that impairs breathing and leads to symptoms of breathlessness, cough, chest tightness, and fatigue. Patients frequently require hospitalizations due to acute exacerbations of symptoms that can be life-threatening. However, warnings from these health agencies are based on limited evidence and no large studies have been conducted to date in COPD patients. Thus, we aim to conduct a study that will assess whether the use of GABAs increases the risk of severe exacerbations in patients with COPD, when used alone and in combination with opioids.

To perform this study, we will use a database that has medical information from over 50 million patients in the United Kingdom who visited a general practitioner. We will then identify patients with COPD and determine whether those using GABAs were hospitalized with a COPD exacerbation more frequently than those who did not. We will also assess whether COPD patients using GABAs in combination with opioids were hospitalized more frequently than those using GABAs or opioids alone. 

The use of GABAs may potentially increase risk of exacerbations and related death in COPD patients. Thus, the findings of our project will provide important information to guide prescription choices for COPD patients and to update safety guidelines for GABAs."

As some sub-populations of youth are more susceptible to ill-health, researchers are increasingly looking to the social context of health (i.e. social determinants rather than biological factors) to address health inequities. Adolescent dating relationships, defined as early romantic encounters and relationships during the teenage years, have generally been overlooked by public health as part of the social context in which teens' health behaviours and coping strategies develop. To address this gap in the literature, I will conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with youth ages 13-19 in two distinct communities (Vancouver, a large metropolitan community and Fort. St. James, a rural, resource-based town) to better understand the role of dating relationships in the everyday lives of youth. The interviews will be analyzed using intersectional gender relations theory to determine how gender, diversity and place impact teens' dating relationships. The study findings will be used to develop intervention strategies to address dating issues in both communities. Ultimately, my doctoral research will contribute to our understanding of how social and structural factors impact dating relationships in adolescence and will offer public health intervention strategies to promote positive relationships and the health of Canadian youth."

Drawing from a review of literature, we compared the role of CBOs in addressing HIV/AIDS through PHC service delivery in five countries with HIV prevalence rates of or lower than 0.2%, similar population dynamics, rural and remote regions, Indigenous populations, and similar healthcare systems including CBOs. We compared the nation-states' commitment to CBOs in terms of: (1) meeting the needs of Most At Risk Populations (MARPs); (2) CBOs engagement in developing policy; and, (3) funding sources, programs and allocation of funding specific to CBOs. 
CBOs play a significant role in the delivery of HIV/AIDS-specific PHC services in all selected countries. While similarities do exist, we found that Canada, Australia, and to a lesser extent, New Zealand, could greatly benefit from the lessons learned in Norway and Sweden, where the coordination of CBOs by the nation/state health system, as well as the development of clear mandates are key to the provision of timely PHC services for those at risk of developing and those living with HIV/AIDS.
Internationally, many countries with similar demographic characteristics and health systems could greatly benefit from strengthening CBOs through clearer mandates and dependable access to funding."

Despite attempts to increase public awareness of the risks associated with drinking during pregnancy, a significant proportion of pregnancies in Canada are alcohol-exposed, and a disproportionate percentage of high-risk pregnancies appear to involve drug and alcohol exposure.

Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD) is the umbrella term encompassing all of the adverse developmental outcomes in children resulting from prenatal alcohol exposure. FASD has been demonstrated to have a substantial negative impact on all facets of society, and is the leading preventable cause of behavioural and cognitive disorders in children. According to Health Canada, approximately 1 in 100 babies are born with FASD every year. 

Even in the absence of a diagnosis of an FASD, research data suggest that alcohol use during pregnancy is associated with some level of behavioural or cognitive impairment in children. 

The Café panel will discuss FASD research and the effects of maternal drinking during pregnancy and consequent prenatal alcohol exposure, as well as the impact on individuals, families and society, including the heavy economic impact and the challenges of managing individuals with FASD in the judicial system. The panel will also discuss the challenges of contrasting advice from health care professionals for pregnant women, as well as the increase in binge drinking among young women, and how these choices affect the rate of prenatal alcohol exposure."

Unfortunately, although older men are especially likely to be lonely, they are also particularly unlikely to seek professional help when they need it. Community programs are an alternative to professional-help, and may prevent and combat loneliness and reduced well-being.  Men's Sheds programs, developed in Australia in the 1990's, strive to integrate older men into the community, decrease loneliness and increase social support, mental health and well-being. Two Men's Sheds programs are currently being piloted in Winnipeg, which will allow me to examine the potential benefits, the perceived barriers, and ways to increase access to participation in community programs. Information will be obtained from individual interviews with men ages 65+ (n=20) who are participating in Men's Sheds, and men ages 65+ who are not currently involved in any community social programs (n=20).

Providing mental health treatment for older adults in partnership with community organizations is one way to improve social connection and enhance mental health and may be more accessible and more desirable to older adults. Our team of community leaders, researchers, and psychologists working in aging and mental health has developed a 6-session telephone-based group program for older adults experiencing loneliness, social isolation, and mental health problems (anxiety, depression) called The CONNECT Program. Initial testing of this program in Manitoba provides early evidence that this program is feasible by telephone, members enjoy participating, and they experience lower anxiety and depression and greater social connectedness, mental flexibility, and understanding of mental health after participating. The goals of the current project are to engage community organizations across four Canadian provinces (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Ontario, and British Columbia) in rolling out and testing The CONNECT Program through telephone and virtual modalities. Working with our community organizations at each stage, from project design to sharing project findings, we will evaluate partnerships, the roll out of the program, and how well the program works across provinces in improving loneliness, social connection, and mental health. The expansion of The CONNECT Program, through region and modality, will add to a lack of accessible, evidence-based programming targeting the experiences of loneliness, social isolation, and co-occurring mental health problems among Canadian older adults."
"The Impact of Psychotropic Medication on Health, Public Safety and Costs in a Canadian Correctional Population","['Rezansoff, Stefanie N']",['N/A'],"['Correctional Populations', 'Effectiveness Of Psychotropic Medication', 'Health And Social Policy', 'Health Economics', 'Knowledge Exchange', 'Mental Health', 'Pharmaco-Epidemiology', 'Population-Based Longitudinal Analysis', 'Public Health And Safety', ""Women'S Health""]",105000.0,283916,"Due to low effect sizes & high placebo response rates, previous research questions the efficacy of psychopharmacological treatments. Nonetheless, Canadians are the highest per capita users of psychiatric medications in the world. In correctional centres, these medications dominate drug utilization, yet little research has examined their impact on improved health among mentally ill offenders & improved public safety mediated by greater psychosocial rehabilitation. Current research is also restricted by small sample sizes, limited follow-up, lack of diagnostics, commercial conflicts of interest & incomplete understanding of drug action & disease aetiology. Additional research is needed, especially in Canada, where maintenance of public safety & societal reintegration of inmates are the two primary mandates of correctional services. 

The purpose of my PhD research is to build on existing knowledge concerning the safety & effectiveness of psychiatric medication & to extend this research into the realm of the justice system by focusing on a population of offenders in BC. In particular, I will use linked administrative data from the BC Ministries of Health, Justice, & Social Development to compare behavioural & occupational functioning outcomes (i.e., recidivism, mental health-related hospitalizations, dependence on income assistance & aggregate service-related costs) between physician-diagnosed offenders prescribed psychotropic medications & those who are not. Propensity score matching will be used to establish group comparability. 

Given substantially higher documented prevalence of mental disorder & correspondingly higher prescription of psychotropics among female offenders, outcomes will be examined by sex & adjusted models will control for key socio-demographic variables. 

Results will be relevant to further development of evidence-based policy & services addressing the interaction between the prescription of psychiatric drugs."

Suicide is the second leading cause of death in Canadian youth. For every such suicide, at least 25 youth will present to hospital with suicidal behaviours. These individuals are at a high risk of repeating this behaviour and also dying by suicide. However, it is not known whether these (non-fatal) behaviours have increased or decreased over time in children and youth (and to what degree, for whom). Knowledge of these patterns can help shape policies and programs to prevent suicidal behaviours.  

We propose a longitudinal study in which the rates of hospital emergency department presentations for suicidal behaviours are compared in boys and in girls over the past decade in Alberta and Ontario. We will determine whether these rates (first onset)and repetition(s) have changed over time (and to what degree, for whom). We will track and compare these events annually in all boys and girls (aged 12 to < 17 years) in Alberta and Ontario using province-wide population registry, emergency and hospital inpatient health care records in each province."

burden on the Canadian health care system. Physical inactivity is a modifiable risk factor for CVD and obesity; yet its
prevalence is high among children and their parents. Family-based physical activity interventions may arguably be the most
important target for CVD prevention, yet parents are burdened by excessive time demands that lower the achievement of
physical activity. Our pilot study has shown that teaching parents how to organize and plan family physical activity, using
state-of-the-art planning resources, can improve their physical activity. In this study we will expand on the pilot results by
randomly assigning families with at least one child between 6 and 12 years old, into either an intervention group, or a
standard condition group. The intervention will include planning material on how families can be more active, together. We
will measure their level of activity, motivations, and beliefs after six months. Clearly the prevention of CVD through the
promotion of physical activity is an important research area. Our intervention represents a low-cost, potentially effective
method of physical activity promotion that could result in improved physical activity habits and thus family health."
Evaluation of a Physical Activity Intervention for New Parents,"['Rhodes, Ryan E']","['Beauchamp, Mark R', 'Blanchard, Christopher M', 'Downs, Danielle S', 'Warburton, Darren E']","['Parenthood', 'Physical Activity']",240000.0,290637,"Promotion of regular physical activity (PA) is paramount to obesity prevention and the reduction of over 25 chronic health conditions. National cross-sectional and cohort studies on overweight/obesity prevalence suggest that adult weight gain is highest between ages 25 to 35 and this also corresponds to peak reductions in PA. The onset of parenthood may be an important contributor due to the changes in lifestyle required when raising children. Prior research, including our funded longitudinal trials has shown that, after controlling for other possible demographic factors, parents have lower PA levels compared to nonparents. Thus, the primary objective of this investigation is to test the efficacy of an intervention focused on maintaining the PA of new parents. This study will be a randomized controlled trial conducted with measurements at baseline (2 months post partum), six weeks, three months and six months post-intervention (8 months post partum). Participants will be randomized into one of two groups 1) intervention condition; or 2) standard condition. Based on our current feasibility study underway, 200 participants will be recruited via baby classes. Participants will be common law or married couples, expecting their first child. We expect the recruitment process to be ongoing across the first year and continuing for the following 30 months. The study should be achievable from start to finish in four years. The study will help fill a gap in our understanding of whether a cost-effective intervention implemented through baby classes can improve/maintain PA during transitions to parenthood. This information is important because we have little empirical evidence in the form of intervention research on this matter. All of this research has the potential to be directly applied to population-level knowledge translation sources such as prenatal classes, physician offices, and other early parent learning/counseling avenues."

Among children and adolescents, PA protects against metabolic syndrome, low bone density, depression, and obesity, and forms the behavioral patterns necessary to foster health benefits across the life course. Unfortunately, very few Canadians engage in enough PA to reap its health benefits. There is a clear need to promote PA within the family unit yet interventions focused on the family have been scarce and have had negligible impact. My research career has focused on the theoretical underpinnings of family-level PA and the application of these factors to PA promotion. Much of the past research on family-based PA has focused on increasing the knowledge base of PA's benefits in an attempt to raise intentions to act. My research has shown that most parents already agree that regular PA is important for them and their children but have difficulty following through on supportive PA intentions. My team's ongoing and recently completed research trials have examined how to promote the factors that bind good intentions to behaviour. The primary objectives of this foundation grant will be to expand upon these prior results by promoting two potentially important factors that have not received enough research attention. One of these factors is parental support habits (trial 1) and the other is parental support identity (subsequent trial 2). The key outcome in these trials will be child PA (measured objectively through a monitoring device). My team will compare whether a habit/identity promotion program focused on parental support of PA can improve child PA beyond basic education and goal-setting over six months. Participants will be families with at least one child between 6 and 12 years old who is not active. All of this research has the potential to be directly applied to national promotion campaigns and physical activity programs for families and contribute to long-term economic health outcomes of Canadians."

Moreover, youth have been consistently left out of conversations, despite recognition of the value of engaging youth to ensure research reflects their varied experiences and resultant resources meet the diverse needs of youth. This project aims to elevate youth voice through the development and dissemination of resources to improve how we support youth MH in secondary schools. We aim to co-develop and disseminate with youth (primary audience; engagement of two youth engagement committees) and school partners, namely teachers (secondary audience; engagement of a teacher advisory committee): 1) A social media suite of resources (posts, stories, reels) for Canadian secondary schools that includes MH statistics, our secondary qualitative findings, and information on available supports and how to access them. 2) A school MH brochure (2-3 pages) for Canadian secondary schools that shares national-, provincial-, and school- and community- specific MH resources. The brochure will be populated with existing national and provincial resources (e.g., Kids Help Phone, Youthspace.ca), with space allocated for schools to include school- and community-specific MH resources. 3) A national webinar and website to further disseminate resources. The webinar will bring together diverse stakeholders (e.g., school boards, policy makers, researchers, clinicians) to discuss Canadian youth MH with guest speakers (including youth) and introduce developed resources.

Cultural determinants of Aboriginal youth health: Translating Indigenous knowledge into quantitative outcomes using the cultural consensus and cultural consonance models,"['Ribeiro, Nuno F']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal Peoples Health', 'Aboriginal Youth', 'Cultural Consensus', 'Cultural Consonance', 'Free Listing', 'Indigenous Methods', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Multivariate Statistics', 'Quantitative Methodologies', 'Social And Cultural Determinants Of Health']",92000.0,270596,"The health status of Aboriginal peoples remains significantly lower than that of other Canadians. Aboriginal youth are at considerably higher risk in regard to tobacco, alcohol, and drug consumption, risky sexual behaviors, physical inactivity, depression, and suicide. The majority of the research conducted on the health of Aboriginal youth has not included culture as a determining factor of health outcomes. Quantitative research in Aboriginal youth health is also lacking, resulting in reduced possibilities for comparison and generalization of results. These research gaps have an adverse effect on the delivery of health care to Aboriginal youth and ultimately in the overall improvement of their health status. Presently there is great need for Aboriginal youth health research that not only incorporates Indigenous knowledge and recognizes Aboriginal culture as an important determinant of health, but that also employs quantitative methodologies that allow for reliable comparisons between populations, and for extrapolation of results beyond the people surveyed. The proposed research will be part of a Canadian Institute of Health Research-funded research program and will collect data from eleven Aboriginal communities in rural Saskatchewan in order to measure the impact of culture on the health behaviors of Aboriginal youth. It will use sophisticated methods of data collection and analysis that: 1) allow Aboriginal youth to define and explain their culture, in their own terms; and 2) measure the impact that said culture has on their health behavior. This research project will make a significant contribution to the field of Aboriginal youth health, through the use of quantitative methodologies and through the translation of Indigenous knowledge into quantitative health outcomes, which will increase the effectiveness of future knowledge translation efforts, policy formulation initiatives, and health interventions."

The job is hard and can be traumatic. A recent study has found that COs have the highest rates of mental disorders of all public safety employees, more than police officers, firefighters and paramedics. Correctional Services Canada's new recruits go through a 13-week training course covering several different things that might happen on the job.  However, nobody has ever looked at if the training effectively prepares the recruits for the job, and if recruits understand what the trainers tried to teach them. 

We plan to go through the 13-week training course with the recruits and work with the trainers - something that has never been done before. We will learn what the trainers aim to teach and whether recruits are actually learning these lessons from the training course. We will also see if people who have worked in prisons before learn things differently than people who are starting their jobs in prisons for the first time. Then, we want to see if the training needs to change to make sure recruits are ready for the job. To do this two researchers will take the 13-week training course to see what a recruit learns. Two other researchers will look at the training course materials to see what CSC wants the trainers to teach. We will talk to the trainers to see what they teach, and survey recruits to see what they've learned. When we are finished the course, we will all come together to see if the training is working and if not, what might be missing. We will also suggest future changes to the training. 

This whole project should take one year. When it is done, we will be able to help CSC know how well their training course is preparing new recruits for their new jobs. This is important because we hope this will help improve the mental health of the recruits. We need to understand how we can train new recruits so that they are ready for what might happen to them at work."

""Creating Opportunities"" is a Population Council project that helps to create, at the community level, safe spaces for girls to form clubs and receive training, recreational activities, as well as accompaniment by mentors and peers in their most important life transitions.  This research is designed to accompany and provide depth to the action research process of this programme in its expansion phase.

The hypothesis is that the ""Creating Opportunities"" programme is affecting public health related variables at the individual and community level by increasing girls' social capital, including friend networks and access to alternate mentors, information providers and role models.  The possible outcomes being affected include greater educational attainment, sexual and reproductive health knowledge, later marriage and first birth age (which can impact maternal health).  A rigorous econometric evaluation based on survey results from control and intervention villages will confirm which variables are being influenced and to what degree.  Qualitative approaches, including focus groups, will help to understand which behaviour change theories may be being evidenced, such as social support theories, which emphasize the role of social networks in promoting behaviour change.

The results of this research are relevant for providing empirical evidence to support behaviour change theories as well as for contributing to the body of knowledge supporting multi-sectoral and more medium-term interventions with public health benefits for marginalized groups."

Given potential health benefits and high barriers to labour market participation for PHAUD and people who use drugs (PUD) at risk for HIV infection, alternative labour market participation models appropriate to this population are urgently needed. While many organizations currently provide vocational services (VS), employment or social enterprise-based opportunities for low-income individuals, there is a dearth of opportunities for PHAUD and PUD. It is unclear whether current service and opportunity providers are aware of research on the income generating patterns and barriers to employment among these populations, or whether this research supports their ongoing operations. Additionally, little research examines the socio-economic and health impacts of VS provision, alternative employment or social enterprise-based opportunities. Finally, current gaps warrant the exploration of alternative labour market access models. The activities outlined in this proposal aim to (1) develop partnerships between researchers and local vocational service providing organizations (VSPO), employers and social enterprises serving PHAUD/PUD; (2) draw on these partnerships to conduct need and feasibility assessments for social and structural interventions targeted at improving access to the labour market for PHAUD; and (3) leverage the outcomes of these assessments to inform research plans to develop, pilot and evaluate such interventions.

While considerable progress has been made in the development of evidence-based interventions, in the context of a toxic drug supply, social risk factors for overdose for opioid users frequently go unaddressed due to slow uptake of evidence in clinical practice and public health policy, resulting in upstream prevention efforts often failing to prevent harm from opioid use. Socioeconomic marginalization (SEM) -- including labour market exclusion, prohibited income generation (e.g. theft, drug dealing, street-based work), material insecurity (e.g. housing or food insecurity) and inadequate income -- is an important but under-explored area with respect to opioid use and associated overdose, and there are currently no systematic reviews that summarize the risk of SEM in producing or increasing overdose risk. This is a critical gap because knowing which elements of SEM are causing overdose will enable the most effective and efficient prevention and intervention tactics. Responding to an urgent need for a review of evidence on how SEM affects overdose the specific objectives of our proposed review are to: 1) conduct a systematic review of scientific evidence describing the relationship between SEM overdose and overdose risk among PWUD; 2) engage with Knowledge Users throughout the planning and execution of the review; 3) identify areas for potential intervention to reduce socioeconomic drivers of overdose risk; 4) undertake integrated knowledge translation activities to support widespread availability of review results and recommendations for action. This review has considerable potential to effectively summarize previously underutilized research evidence to drive policy change."
Socio-economic risk environments and health among people who use illicit drugs,"['Richardson, Lindsey']",['N/A'],"['Drug Use And Addiction', 'Employment And Income Generation', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Poverty And Inequality', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research Participation', 'Social And Structural Interventions', 'Socio-Economic Marginalization']",300000.0,319779,"Socio-economic drivers of health risk are multi-dimensional and complex, and the broader socio-economic risk environment for marginalized people who use drugs (PWUD) has not been fully examined. Further, social and structural interventions to address these impacts are rare, as are examinations of how the socio-economic risk environment shapes research participation. My program of research will examine and develop strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of socio-economic risk on the health of marginalized PWUD across three interconnected lines of inquiry. First, using data from ongoing prospective cohorts of HIV-positive and HIV-negative PWUD, observational studies will examine the health impacts of key components of the socio-economic risk environment on health outcomes, including high-risk drug use; HIV and Hepatitis C-related outcomes, and mental illness. Second, I will implement social and structural intervention studies that test innovative strategies to mitigate the negative health impacts of socio-economic risk. Two RCTs will initiate this line of inquiry: (1) an RCT to test whether altering the distribution of social assistance decreases individual and community harm associated with escalations in drug use around the monthly distribution of social assistance; and (2) an RCT testing the efficacy of an intervention designed to expand access to low-threshold employment opportunities to improve employment uptake, drug use, HIV risk-behaviour and HIV treatment outcomes. Finally, to maximize the ethical and effective conduct of these and other RCTs, a third line of inquiry seeks to identify the individual, social and structural factors that affect recruitment, retention, and protocol adherence in addictions RCT research. This research innovates by linking observational, intervention and research participation studies to produce robust evidence for strategies to improve socio-economic security and health outcomes for people who use drugs."

However, key dimensions of SEM and their health impacts are not fully understood and interventions that address drug use and related harm by targeting SEM are urgently needed. Further, research has shown that there is a strong link between understanding how SEM impacts individual outcomes and the generation of evidence-based strategies to reduce health inequity. My proposed program builds on my previous research in this field, and includes an established network of local, national and international collaborators, a growing training platform, and an integrated knowledge translation (iKT) strategy. My overall goal is to reduce drug use and related harm through effective interventions that address SEM among people who use illicit drugs. Using linked observational, intervention and randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluation studies, the specific objectives of my CIHR Foundation program are to:

1)  Conduct observational research that identifies elements of SEM to be targeted via social and structural interventions;

2)  Implement social and structural RCTs that test public health solutions targeting SEM; and

3)  Evaluate how social and structural drivers of SEM affect addictions RCT recruitment, retention and experiences from local and comparative national perspectives.

Through qualitative, quantitative, experimental and mixed-methods approaches, this work will yield a robust evidence base for strategies to reduce drug use and drug-related harm driven by SEM. Parallel iKT initiatives will promote the integration of public health objectives into social and welfare policy, thereby reducing the human and health system costs of SEM among people who use drugs."

This is particularly the case for inner-city, drug-using populations in the context of the ongoing and conjoined overdose and COVID- 19 health emergencies, which disproportionately impact this population. The ASSET study leverages and expands an existing pilot study, seeking to examine the dynamics and impacts of innovative economic participation in the context of multiple intersecting health challenges, with a view to identifying programmatic and policy responses to improve individual health and socioeconomic well-being. The study's objectives are to: (1) identify relationships between economic activities and individual health and socioeconomic well-being; (2) examine the impacts of the pandemic and associated government responses on participants; (3) explore how participants navigate, perceive and experience economic participation; and (4) identify modifiable barriers to and facilitators of economic participation. An ongoing cohort-based evaluation with a nested qualitative component, this study employs innovative, pandemic-appropriate remote data collection techniques, drawing on quarterly surveys and annual semi-structured interviews to assess whether and how economic participation impacts the health and well- being of inner-city, drug using populations. The study will pay specific attention to naturally occurring changes in the health, service provision and policy environment. The ASSET study works with a range of community and government partners to optimize impact, will provide data for economic-opportunity-providing organizations for internal evaluations and will inform policy and programmatic responses to ongoing health emergencies. Understanding the effectiveness of strategies to disrupt the poverty-drug use-poor health nexus in times of formidable public health crises, as this study proposes, is critical to addressing health inequity."

Emerging intervention models  offer promising ways to address employment barriers. These models modify conventional employment interventions by acknowledging workers' comorbidities, episodic absences, and service utilization needs. Yet little research has documented whether and how these intervention models impact economic engagement, employment, and health in inner-city populations, even as these interventions become increasingly integral to urban environments. The proposed project aims to improve the economic and health equity impacts of low-threshold economic engagement models by: (1) Increasing understandings of economic engagement and health in inner-city populations; (2) Comparing the health and economic engagement of inner-city populations with newly-available population-level data on precarious employment among workers in British Columbia; and (3) Advancing a circular data model to aid community organizations in analyzing data to inform the improvement and expansion of innovative economic engagement opportunities. To meet its goals, this project leverages the unique cohort data and the knowledge translation/exchange infrastructure of the ASSessing Economic Transitions Study (ASSET). ASSET data are suited for assessing trends in economic engagement and physical/mental health in inner-city populations. The data are also suited to studying the impacts of low-threshold economic engagement, and may be compared with data from ongoing studies of inner-city residents and workers across the province. Knowledge exchange centering data stewardship and literacy will facilitate a direct knowledge-to-action pipeline. The scientific and programmatic evidence generated will inform actions to address the interrelated public health issues of growing labour market precarity and the overdose crisis."

High patient incidence of chronic health conditions led SOAHAC to engage in research to assess patterns and determinants of Indigenous food security in London. Results demonstrated high levels of food insecurity, especially among single mother-led families, and a strong desire for increased access to traditional foods. SOAHAC created its Traditional Food Bag (TFB) in 2021 to offer traditional foods through its broader Indigenous Food Bank offering. Despite its important provisioning of these important cultural foods, the TFB's current operational model is highly problematic as it lacks a long-term sustainability and workload plan, and offers minimal cultural supports or Indigenous knowledge resources or practices. The objectives of this Indigenous-led, community-engaged research are to expand the current activities of the TFB, by co-creating, operationalizing, and documenting a range of participatory land-based activities related to traditional foods (e.g., food preparation, gardening, and hunting/harvesting activities), thereby planting the seeds for Indigenous food sovereignty by creating rich, well-supported spaces to grow, evaluate and share participant knowledge about the meanings, use and preparation of diverse traditional foods. These activities will be accentuated by a range of on-the-land workshops that will be developed by, with and for First Nation Peoples living in London so that they can come to know and care for the lands of the city. We will employ a range of Indigenous methods, including land-based learning, story-telling, map-making, and a range of ethnographic and creative methodologies to document and analyze these land-based activities, so that we can share our learning and impact broadly with Indigenous organizations and communities, as well as scholarly and policy audiences."

Osteoarthritis is a chronic musculoskeletal condition that negatively affects mobility. Knowledge translation among researchers, health care providers, policy makers, as well as continual development of strong researchers in the area of injury prevention, including the prevention of musculoskeletal injuries, is important for the future health of Canadians.

In 2009, the Canadian government held a national competition to fund teams in injury prevention. The Child and Youth Injury Prevention (C&Y) team developed a practice of injury prevention that involved researchers, community members, and trainees as part of a multidisciplinary approach to reducing injury in children and youth including musculoskeletal injuries. Over the past five years, C&Y developed a strong and successful team, focusing on supporting and highlighting the work of team trainees. In particular, the C&Y team has supported the development and sustainability of the newly formed, Canadian Injury Prevention Trainee Network (CIPTN). 

The purpose of this grant application is to obtain funding for developing  an updated curriculum for the Canadian Collaborating Centres for Injury Prevention (CCCIP). This update aligns with their new injury prevention textbook, developed in partnership with the CIPTN. In addition, this grant will assist with sustainability of the CIPTN by providing funding to plan future CIPTN activities. The CCCIP curriculum is designed to provide practitioners the understanding of the theory and practice of injury prevention in general and to provide the tools needed to develop and implement effective musculoskeletal injury prevention programs"

Access to SRHS is a human right and a major problem for head porters, which negatively affects their physical, psychological, sexual, and socioeconomic health and wellbeing. Access to SRHS is further affected by the recurring epidemics and the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Fear, reduced income, disrupted transport keep women away from SRHS. Further, constrained by financial and other resources, e.g., infrastructure and a well-functioning health system, access to basic and fundamental services, especially SRHS, are limited, for this vulnerable and socioeconomically disadvantaged group.

Goal: Develop and test a service delivery intervention to improve access and utilization of SRHS for head porters in Ghanaian markets. We are proposing a multiphase study.
Phase 1: Assess the current knowledge related to access to SRHS of head porters working in markets in Ghana, using different methods to generate a comprehensive set of information. It will include a literature review, policy and document analysis, and community assessment of available SRHS. 
Phase 2: Explore the needs and challenges experienced by different participants to access and/or deliver SRHS to head porters. 
Phase 3: Sharing of knowledge and the development of the SRHS delivery intervention, using participatory approaches.

Consequently, an increasing number of jurisdictions globally are adopting a pop tax to curb intake, as recommended by the World Health Organization. Canada has not yet adopted the tax, but its merit is being widely debated. In Canada, the burden of obesity and type 2 diabetes is greater among lower socioeconomic groups and Indigenous populations while pop intake is higher within these same groups. These realities underscore the need to understand the perceived impact of a pop tax on intake among low socioeconomic groups and Indigenous populations to improve population health outcomes.

Obesity, diet quality, and food security are considered important contributors to disparities in diabetes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations. The federal government has recently pledged to address the Truth and Reconciliation Calls to Action, which includes ongoing monitoring of health disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. We propose to investigate obesity, diet quality, and food security, which are important aspects of these health disparities. The proposed study will utilize Statistics Canada data from the Canadian Community Health Survey Nutrition surveys in 2004 and 2015. Both surveys include representative samples of the Canadian population for each time period, excluding First Nations people on-reserve and the northern territories. We aim to describe rates of obesity, diet quality, and rates of food insecurity for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous children and adults in 2004 and 2015, respectively. Secondly, we aim to test for differences in these rates between 2004 and 2015 to determine whether the gap in obesity, diet quality, and food security between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations has narrowed over time. The results will provide evidence of the broad effectiveness that many regional food- and income-based policies have had on obesity, diet quality, and food security among the off-reserve Indigenous population and inform future policy development; for example, minimum guaranteed income. Findings will also indicate the degree of difference in obesity and diet quality between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations that is attributed to food insecurity and socioeconomic factors. The study will also contribute towards creating measurable goals to close the gaps in health outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people."
Sticky money: Exploring the acceptability of a sugar-sweetened beverage tax among Canadian Indigenous populations,"['Riediger, Natalie D']",['N/A'],"['Cardiovascular Disease', 'Diabetes', 'First Nations', 'Health Equity', 'Indigenous', 'Obesity', 'Sugar', 'Sugar-Sweetened Beverage Tax', 'Sugar-Sweetened Beverages', 'Tobacco Tax']",345000.0,373151,"Evidence suggests that pop contributes a lot of sugar to the Canadian diet, which is linked to increasing levels of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Consequently, an increasing number of jurisdictions globally are adopting a pop tax to curb intake, as recommended by the World Health Organization. Canada has not yet adopted the tax, but its merit is being widely debated. In Canada, the burden of obesity and type 2 diabetes is greater among lower socioeconomic groups and Indigenous populations while pop intake is higher within these same groups. These realities underscore the need to understand the perceived impact of a pop tax on intake among low socioeconomic groups and Indigenous populations to improve population health outcomes. However, previous experience with tobacco taxes have demonstrated that taxes are not effective policy levers in reducing smoking rates among low socioeconomic groups, thus suggesting that a similar tax on pop may also be ineffective.

However, Western research approaches are often used in an attempt to understand Indigenous perspectives, resulting in findings and policies which fail to address the priorities and health needs of Indigenous peoples. Storytelling, long used by Indigenous communities to share knowledge, is increasingly being used as a research approach by Indigenous people and settlers to privilege Indigenous perspectives. However, this work has not been critically reviewed. Our study purpose is to better understand and elevate the use of storytelling as an approach in Indigenous health research. In this collaborative research project, a team of Indigenous patients, Elders, healthcare providers, and administrators will join Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers to bring multiple perspectives and experiences to the research. Our multidisciplinary team will find and critically review research using storytelling to determine how this approach has been used in Indigenous health research. Team members will co-create the research objectives, and continue to work together throughout the research project to ensure that Indigenous patient voices and perspectives are prioritized. We will also develop a framework to guide the respectful use of storytelling approaches in health research that involves Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. Although we understand some of the reasons behind why the health of Indigenous peoples is worse than the health of other Canadians, there are still many unknowns. Research that prioritizes Indigenous voices and knowledges using storytelling is crucial for filling the gaps in our understanding. This research project will develop a better understanding of respectful approaches to storytelling in health research among Indigenous peoples, and promote storytelling as a meaningful way of gaining new knowledge to address the health needs of Indigenous peoples."

Even though we have good knowledge about the mix of programs, policies and other interventions that can prevent cancers in populations, this knowledge is not consistently put into practice. If we fail to implement interventions we know work, we fail to get results we want, such as fewer cancers among Canadians. Implementing interventions that work to increase how many people are reached and to improve results is called 'scaling up'. When it comes to preventing cancers (and other chronic diseases with common causes) at a population level, much more work is needed on scaling up. A team of research and practice experts with a shared interest in scaling up came together last year and successfully received research funding to summarize what is found in the literature about different routes or pathways for scaling up interventions for prevention. The team realized early on that, in addition to lessons about scaling up from the literature, they had a lot to learn from each other and needed to make sure the funded summary was only a first step in their work together to better understand and improve scaling up. They also realized that to learn with and from each other and make longer term plans, they needed to come together in person. The proposed meeting will bring this group together in April 2015. The meeting will compare findings from the literature review with practical experiences, refine plans for sharing results beyond the workshop participants, and begin to develop a plan for learning with and from examples of scaling up prevention interventions."

Insufficient access to primary health care may undermine both the capacity to prevent transmission of COVID-19 infection, as well as effectively manage pre-existing chronic diseases. Moreover, relational factors necessary to provide high-quality PHC with Indigenous patients may be inhibited by virtual care provision. To address this gap our research team co-developed a virtual care Indigenous patient experience tool via a previous CIHR-funded project. This tool is oriented to monitoring and improving the quality of virtual PHC contacts with Indigenous patients. The next stage of this research is to evaluate and implement the tool with Indigenous health service partners. Informed by principles of implementation science, we will implement an Indigenous patient experience of virtual care tool with the Alberta Indigenous Virtual Care Clinic (AIVCC) to monitor and measure patient experience. Qualitative semi-structured interviews will be completed with patients and providers from the AIVCC to understand the acceptability and utility of the tool, and to understand barriers and facilitators to implementation. Specific implementation strategies will be determined through the completion of the interviews with additional qualitative interviews completed post-implementation to support a process evaluation. Anticipated strategies include the creation of an online infrastructure for the AIVCC to collect patient experience data and to generate a feedback report that the AIVCC can access on an ongoing basis and educational supports for clinic staff. This work will improve the ongoing virtual delivery of PHC with Indigenous patients arising from COVID-19 by providing methods to measure the quality of the virtual care encounter."

In this context, the work presented in this proposal builds on our previous efforts to implement community-based programs to improve food access.  We propose a two-pronged approach that aims to a) further improve and support food access programs, and b) evaluate the impact of these programs on the dietary practices and metabolic health of individuals living in these communities.  It is expected that, in view of the limited access to nutritious and high prevalence of chronic diseases in many northern communities, improved access to nutritious foods and increased intake of these foods will result in significant improvements in metabolic conditions linked to a number of chronic diseases."

More specifically, this initiative wishes to answer the following questions: (1) What are the structural factors (e.g. migration and work-related) determining migrant women's vulnerability to SGBV, sexual exploitation and abuse? (2) What are the perceived effects of exposure to SGBV, sexual exploitation and abuse on migrant women's health? (3) What are the individual or collective help seeking behaviours and coping strategies when migrant women are exposed to SGBV, sexual exploitation and abuse? (4) Which models and methods of health care delivery, partnerships and consorted efforts are available to reduce migrant women's vulnerability to SGBV, sexual exploitation and abuse? The research relies on mixed methods combining ethnographic and qualitative methods with standardized health questionnaires, accessing a sample of women in each of the targeted migrant populations, personnel overseeing their work and migration, healthcare providers, as well as community groups and other organizations involved with serving migrant populations.

Significant increases in stress, anxiety and depression levels have been reported. Furthermore, it is anticipated that many chronic illnesses unrelated to COVID-19 may worsen because they are receiving lower medical attention. Concerns have been raised about disproportionate direct and indirect impacts on Indigenous health. Firstly, the cumulative pressure that this crisis is imposing on healthcare systems is likely to aggravate pre-existing difficulties faced by Indigenous peoples to access appropriate and culturally safe healthcare. Secondly, the progressive widening of socioeconomic disparities resulting from this crisis is taking a greater toll on Indigenous communities. Thirdly, fundamental specificities and strengths of Indigenous communities may influence the health-related consequences of this pandemic. Led by the Ottawa Aboriginal Coalition, in collaboration with Indigenous patient representatives and an interdisciplinary research team, this project will converge Indigenous methods nested in wholistic health approaches with patient-oriented research to investigate the direct and indirect impacts of this global crisis on the health of Indigenous peoples in Canada. This will be done in three phases via Indigenous-led : i) analyses of existing survey data collected during the first pandemic wave, ii) collection of oral/narrative evidence during virtual focus groups structured around Sharing Circles traditions, and ii) co-creation and diffusion of a survey focused on Indigenous health. Knowledge translation and advocacy activities will take place dynamically across the different project phases to enable rapid impacts."

Previous studies have found correlations between minority status and poor pregnancy outcomes. One explanation for this phenomenon is that minority status increases the levels of stress experienced during pregnancy. In turn, prenatal stress is correlated with adverse birth outcomes. Conversely, the formation of primary supports has been identified as a protective factor in pregnancy health outcomes. However, little is known about how some minority status women successfully form primary support networks during pregnancy, while others do not. This study will address the knowledge gap in relation to pregnancy experiences of minority status women by identifying (a) facilitative strategies used in primary support formation and (b) the barriers to primary support in Canada. 
A purposive sample of pregnant women will be recruited from various cultural centers in Calgary. Recruitment will target the three most populous visible minorities in Calgary: South Asian, Chinese, and Filipino. Qualitative interviews will be conducted using the Enhanced Critical Incident Technique at 25-28 and 32-36 week of pregnancy to answer the question: What are the specific experiences that enhance, or act as barriers to, the formation of primary support networks for minority status women during pregnancy? Interviews will continue to be conducted until the data are saturated, which is when no new data emerge, and is estimated to be between 10-15 interviews per ethnic group. Data will be analyzed inductively using a process of data reduction, data display, and data compilation. 
The information ascertained will allow primary care providers to strategically focus prenatal intervention planning specific to the needs of minority status populations. Findings from this study can be used to inform both policy and practice, ultimately improving pregnancy outcomes of marginalized women"

It is well known that providing care at home for a seriously ill or dying family member can be deeply meaningful and rewarding. At the same time, caregiving can be challenging and family caregivers are at risk of a decrease in their own health and wellbeing. Caregiving can be costly - emotionally, physically, relationally, and financially. Who cares for the caregivers? Our research indicates that we have added the expectation for family caregivers to care for themselves at the same time as providing critical care for a sick family member. However, family caregivers do not typically attend to their own health needs and often do not get the support they need to provide care. Family caregivers have well recognized needs such as education about illness and caregiving, skill development around the practical problems of providing care and relieving suffering, and assistance with navigating the health care system. But these needs are often unmet. These findings raise important questions for discussion: How can we adequately support family caregivers to do the critical work of providing care? How can we help family caregivers maintain their health and wellbeing in the process?"

The primary cause of sickness and death in Canada is chronic disease. As we age, the likelihood of living with at least one chronic illness rises steeply. Canadians are living longer and many are living sicker. A recent report from the Canadian Institute for Health Information highlighted gaps in healthcare for people living with chronic illness and pointed out that Canadians living with chronic diseases may not be receiving all the care they need. Women tend to be disadvantaged along with rural residents and those with low income. When we cannot cure your illness, the focus must turn to maximizing comfort, supporting quality of life and engaging with families where most of illness care occurs.  In other words, the focus becomes living well. Our research indicates that we can support quality of life and that different strategies may be needed for persons with illness as compared to family caregivers, for women as compared to men, and for rural residents as compared to urban residents. However, our research also raises fundamental questions about how to think about quality of life when there is progressive advanced illness that is accompanied by loss and, inevitably, death. Our findings raise important areas for discussion - how can we support quality of life for all involved family members regardless of gender, place of residence, or whether they are providers or recipients of care?

There is promising evidence that group therapy provided early post-injury can improve long-term outcomes but there is a need to obtain clinical evidence on the benefits of these types of programs. Hence, the purpose of the present study is to examine the benefits of a group therapy program that provides NMSK trauma inpatients undergoing rehabilitation with knowledge and skills to help them cope long-term. To test this program, we will assign some people to a group therapy program and others will undergo standard rehabilitation (no group therapy). We believe those who receive the group therapy will show a better ability to cope with their injury than those who do not receive it. As a result of undergoing the group program, patients with NMSK injuries will be able to avoid serious issues (e.g., depression) in the community, and be able to obtain a better quality of life. The findings from this research will be used to develop a larger and more powerful clinical trial to test the effectiveness of our intervention. As a result, we will generate the necessary evidence to support similar types of group therapy programs that other trauma rehabilitation hospitals can use to ensure that this group of patients' mental health needs are fully met."

Although ticks are often associated with forested areas, urban and peri-urban exposure are frequently thought to be the source of tick exposure for LD cases, particularly in municipalities where private yards are bordered by forests or where municipal parks host significant populations of deer and rodents.

Healthy Cities benefit from greening public and private spaces and promoting access to green spaces. However, in some urban and periurban settings, green spaces may be associated with LD risk, which may induce significant psychological stress and may limit outdoors activities. Hence, risk mitigation strategies that maximize the benefits of spending time in vegetated areas while reducing TBD risk are required for urban and peri-urban settings.

Various interventions have been developed in the last two decades to reduce the risk of human encounter with B. burgdorferi infected questing ticks. However, few of these interventions have demonstrated consistent effectiveness at reducing the risk of tick exposure in humans or the risk of Lyme disease and even fewer are considered efficient, feasible and socially acceptable. Citizens or municipal authorities may find some interventions hard to implement or resource-intensive and the sustainability of such interventions is thus questionable if the requirements of local day-to-day management are not considered in the development phases of interventions.

We thus propose to create a network of researchers and empowered municipal end-user stakeholders and citizens to codevelop, based on the best scientific knowledge available on LD risk management, locally adapted integrated interventions that could eventually be supported by urban or peri-urban communities. This work will support the development of the network and evidence-informed risk reduction strategies for urban and peri-urban communities in Canada."

D'un point de vue démographique, ce sont là d'excellentes nouvelles, mais au niveau de l'accès aux soins et services en périnatalité, ces naissances soulèvent d'importants enjeux. Pour bien y répondre dans une logique de responsabilité populationnelle, les organismes communautaires du secteur famille sont appelés à travailler davantage en partenariat avec les centres de santé et de services sociaux (CSSS). Notre projet a pour but d'évaluer les services de relevailles offerts par quatre organismes communautaires du secteur famille et les collaborations intersectorielles qu'ils partagent avec leur CSSS en vue de consolider les services de santé et de soutien en période postnatale. Le programme de relevailles est une intervention de promotion de la santé qui consiste à offrir un soutien postnatal à domicile qui s'adapte aux besoins de chaque famille, afin d'écouter, d'encourager, d'informer et de soutenir l'organisation du quotidien. De manière générale, les études démontrent que de tels programmes d'intervention à domicile ont le potentiel de contribuer au soutien à l'allaitement maternel, au développement des compétences parentales et à la promotion de saines habitudes de vie. Misant sur une rigoureuse approche de recherche évaluative, nous répondrons à des questions pertinentes en vue d'optimiser les collaborations intersectorielles entourant l'offre de relevailles par les organismes communautaires. Les résultats qui ressortiront de notre étude permettront ainsi de promouvoir la santé et l'équité auprès des familles, en contribuant à consolider les services de santé et de soutien durant la période postnatale."
Identifying Key Prescribing CASCADes in the Elderly: A Transnational Initiative on Drug Safety,"['Rochon, Paula A']",['N/A'],"['Administrative Data', 'Adverse Events', 'Clinical Data', 'Gender', 'Interdisciplinary', 'Mixed Methods', 'Older Adults', 'Polypharmacy', 'Sex', 'Transnational']",132333.0,387882,"Prescribing cascades occur when a health care provider misinterprets the side effect of a drug as a new medical condition and prescribes a second, potentially unnecessary, harmful drug to address the side effect. Identifying prescribing cascades represents an important, actionable, strategy to improve the health of older adults. Adverse events are generally more common in women than in men. To inform tailored interventions, there is a need to understand potential sex and gender differences in how cascades develop and are managed. In this transnational study, an interdisciplinary team of experts in sex, gender, and ageing will respond to this critical gap by applying a sex and gender lens to complementary health data from four countries. Specifically we plan to evaluate whether men and women develop prescribing cascades in the same way, and if there are differences in how they present with adverse event(s) from a prescribing cascade. We will use administrative and clinical data on older adults to calculate sex-stratified prevalence rates for three prescribing cascades prioritized by our collaborating partners. We will also interview prescribers, patients, and caregivers to explore how socially constructed gender roles contribute to the experience, presentation, and management of prescribing cascades. Findings will improve our understanding of how adverse drug events are different between older women and men and inform the development and dissemination of tailored knowledge translation products to reduce the frequency and impact of prescribing cascades."
Reimagining Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs) for 21st Century Cities: What Works Best to Support Older Adults to Age in Place?,"['Rochon, Paula A', 'Huynh, Tai', 'Ivers, Noah M', 'Savage, Rachel']","['Depaul, Vincent G', 'Donnelly, Catherine A', 'Feng, Patrick', 'Kuluski, Kerry H', 'Shaw, James A']","['Community Programing', 'Older Adults', 'Population Health', 'Quality Of Life', 'Reducing Social Isolation And Loneliness', 'Sex And Gender', 'Supportive Environments']",24949.0,459805,"Many older adults live clustered in buildings or communities, known as Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORCs). These communities provide an opportunity to deliver on-site social supports and health services in efficient and creative ways to prevent loneliness, improve health and well-being, and support older adults to age in place. Few NORCs, however, have been enhanced like this because little is known about how to create, implement or sustain these types of models. 

Our research will fill these gaps by identifying which NORC sites are best suited for enhancement, and what factors promote or hinder their successful implementation. We will also examine if the level of support (or degree of enhancement) provided by the model changes how it is implemented and its effectiveness. Exploring sex and gender differences in how the models work and their impact will be important as most older adults living in NORCs are women.
 
We will implement three enhanced NORC models at 6 sites - first in Toronto, one of the most diverse cities in the world, and then later in Barrie, a quickly growing mid-sized city. The models will vary in the intensity of support they provide (low, medium, and high) to older adults. We will evaluate both the process of implementation to understand what works, for whom and in what circumstances, and the impact of the models on older adults and the healthcare system. 
  
The project will be guided by a strong implementation science team and researchers with expertise in aging. We will engage a diverse Stakeholder Advisory Committee of residents, building owners, municipal representatives, and program and research staff so that our findings are useful and actionable. This first of its kind project will reimagine aging in place and deliver practical tools - an implementation toolkit and a community of practice - to support the spread and scale of enhanced NORCs in ways that benefit all, across Canadian and international cities."

Further, taking care of pets involves caring for one's self and others, which the World Health Organization identifies as the basis for promoting human health. A dog who 'says hello' at the end of the day can foster a sense of worthiness, and when the same dog 'says hello' to other dogs on daily walks around the neighbourhood, strangers can be brought into conversation. Neighbours who take turns looking after each others' cats also build a connection. Elderly citizens make sure their beloved pets never go hungry. The list of how pets are embedded in emotional well-being could go on practically forever. The proposed Chair will involve carefully examining policies, practices and settings that promote mental health by supporting people's efforts to care for pets, and by helping to mitigate the potential for pets to harm or annoy others. As pets come under municipal jurisdiction, the main partnership is local. Building on past successes and established relationships for continual sharing of knowledge, the City of Calgary will function as a 'living laboratory.' Nevertheless, there are implications for provincial and national policies (e.g., on income security and housing security). In addition, the lessons learned will have relevance internationally. Contributions will include novel insights and new leverage points in policies, practices, and settings to promote mental health. These contributions could be missed, if the significance of pets is not taken seriously. Emerging talent aligned to this Chair program includes assistant professors and advanced trainees. Additional collaborators include established investigators in veterinary medicine. The research environment is anchored by the Population Health & Inequities Research Centre, within the Institute for Public Health at the University of Calgary."
PEOPLE'S PETS AND POPULATION HEALTH PROMOTION: A province-wide qualitative study of animal bylaws,"['Rock, Melanie J']",['N/A'],"['Anthropology', 'Anthrozoology', 'Health Promotion', 'Human-Animal Studies', 'Implementation Systems', 'Population Health', 'Socio-Legal Studies', 'Urban Studies']",66310.0,252795,"Members of the public are used to thinking about pets as aids in healthcare, but the importance of people's pets for the public's health is not limited to sick people. Pets bring joy to people's lives and can help people feel a sense of belonging. Feeling responsible for a pet can lead people to assimilate health information (e.g., how feline diabetes compares with type 2 diabetes in people) and to adopt healthy routines (e.g., dog-walking). Half of all Canadian households include pets, and many more would have a pet, if only their circumstances would allow. These pets are usually treated like family members. As an example, the Calgary Food Bank routinely screens for the presence of pets in the home, because people will sometimes feed a pet before themselves, and surrendering or abandoning a pet is unthinkable, even when income is low.

This study will be the first -- in any field -- to investigate how municipalities are balancing people's attachments to their pets, on the one hand, with complaints and concerns about other people's pets, on the other hand. Our starting place is that the presence of pets in cities and towns shouldn't be taken for granted, so we will look carefully at municipal bylaws that allow people to keep pets, as long as they follow rules. We know from research on smoking bans that the wording of bylaws is important, so we will pay close attention to what pet bylaws say -- and what they leave out. Research on smoking bans has also taught us that the implementation systems surrounding bylaws are critical, so we will not stop at ""the letter of the law."" By conducting 44 in-person interviews in cities and towns across Alberta, we will learn first-hand about what it is like to draft, amend and implement bylaws on pets. Through these interviews, we will engage potential end-users of this research, and we will collaborate with these organizations in sharing our findings with the general public via the mass media."

Pets anchor our investigation of small differences to well-being that stand, through accumulation and ripple effects, to carry major consequences for health inequity. In this project, barriers to a positive experience of pet ownership among lower-income Canadians will serve as a prism for rethinking the nature of society, the basis for promoting population health, and the meaning of social justice. While previous health research on the benefits of pet ownership has focused mainly on measuring associations, our main concern is unevenness in the preconditions for a positive experience of pet ownership. By listening closely to low-income Canadians' stories about pet ownership in interviews, and by placing these stories into a broader scholarly, cultural, and political context, we will be re-examining the relationship between poverty and ill-health. We will also translate what we have learned into public debate, thereby improving public understanding of poor mental health, the role of social stressors in health outcomes, and health inequity. In terms of policy and practice, this project is relevant to animal welfare charities, poverty alleviation, housing, and human rights."

This application takes a different approach. We investigate the everyday generation of small differences to well-being in ordinary urban contexts. We investigate how small decisions, differences and experiences play out in ways that magnify and widen health inequities. We use dogs as the vehicle to make this examination. 
Half of Canadian households have pets. People construct their lives around them. In doing so, people are learning and making decisions that influence human health without thinking that they are. Dog walking affects physical activity and mental health. Neighbours who would ordinarily pass each other on the street, now stop and chat because a dog insists on saying 'hello.'  The public is used to thinking about pets as aids in health care.  But pets are a way to explore pathways to population health and health equity, as well. 
To examine the roles played by pets in urban settings, we propose to study what happens before and after the City of Calgary allows people to unleash their dogs in four green spaces where, at present, dogs are allowed only if leashed. These areas will still be subject to the Responsible Pet Owner Bylaw, which requires owners to pick up their dog's litter, and which says that dogs can be off-leash only if they remain under control and do not pose a nuisance to people or wildlife. Incivilities like these, if left unchecked, 'spiral down' to feelings of insecurity and anger, encourage disorder to spread, and lead people to avoid strangers and even neighbours. We want to help veterinarians, City bylaw officers, animal welfare charities and neighbourhood organizations to intervene in ways that 'spiral up' to promote population health."
Coconut Oil Cures and Dentures Cause Dementia: why is the science of dementia so hard to understand?,"['Rockwood, Kenneth']","['Macdonald, Wenda F', 'Darvesh, Sultan', 'Hayden, Jill A']","['Cafe Scientifique', 'Dementia', 'Evidence Based', 'Outreach', 'Public']",2408.0,288219,"By 2030 about 750,000 Canadians are expected to have dementia. In Nova Scotia that number will be disproportionately higher (over 28,000 people or 2.5% of the population) reflecting its older than average age structure. It is no wonder that dementia is second only to cancer as a health concern for older Canadians. In Canada, as of 2009, 77% of the population were online at home, and many now use this tool to address their fears and concerns. The explosion of  information online and in traditional media means that those with an interest in dementia must do a lot of sifting through evidence based and other information - which often sit side by side.  Accessing quality research in a format easily understood is a challenge for the public, with inaccurate representations of research and scientific verbiage or  jargon at times being used to encourage interest in a treatment or intervention. Among the general public in Canada, scientific literacy (knowledge of scientific concepts sufficient to impact a person's ability to function in a  modern, industrial society) is estimated to be below 20% . Low levels of health literacy (the degree to which individuals can obtain, process and use basic health information to make decisions)  are also a problem for many Canadians, particularly as they age. Recognizing  high-quality evidence, knowing how to look for this, and understanding  its fundamental importance to quality dementia care and treatment is often asking much of the general public - so how can we help them? The purpose of this Cafe Scientifique is to open a discussion about how the public can better understand and interpret the science (and pseudo science) of dementia as it appears in the media and online world  - what is  the difference between evidence-based information and anecdotal claims, and why is this important?"

The FI-Combined provides information about frailty before it is clinically manifested. Previous reports among Canadians and US participants showed that the FI-Combined was better at predicting mortality compared to an FI constructed only using self-reported items. In this study, we propose to develop an FI-Combined using data from the following aging population databases: the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging, the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, Longitudinal Ageing Study in India - Diagnostic Assessment of Dementia, the Mexican Health and Aging Study, The Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing, the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe and the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey. We will examine the ability of the FI-Combined to predict hospitalizations, falls and mortality. We will also evaluate reproducibility of FI-Combined across all the datasets included in this study. The results from this study will assist the future to development of targeted interventions and support better healthcare decision making across countries."

In fact, we specifically posit that the 'explicit' reasons will display more desireable motivational characteristics whereas the 'implicit' expectations will display more controlling characteristics that are likely to undermine exercise adherence. We further believe that the non-acheivement of the implicit outcomes will have a negative influence on exercise persistence. Finally, we plan to develop imagery based interventions that will enhance the motivational characteristics of all the outcome expectations and so improve exercise adherence by reducing the negative effects of not getting what we want."

Co-developing an intervention to reduce sedentary behaviour in older adults who are frail: A mix-methods longitudinal study,"['Rodrigues, Isabel']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Behaviour Change Theory', 'Falls', 'Fractures', 'Frailty', 'Knowledge Translation/Mobilization', 'Sedentary Behaviour']",112500.0,473485,"People who are frail have a reduced ability to recover from an illness or injury. Most older adults who are frail spend 80% of their awake time engaged in sedentary behaviours. Sedentary behaviour includes sitting, reclining, or lying while expending very little energy. Prolonged periods of sedentary behaviour are associated with decreased mobility and quality of life, and an increased risk of falls and early death. While the harms of sedentary behaviour are well documented in the literature, there is limited evidence on interventions to reduce sedentary behaviour among older adults, especially older adults who are frail. 

The proposed project aims to develop an intervention to decrease certain types of sedentary behaviours associated with negative health outcomes in older adults who are frail. For the first study, I will use a unique combination of technology and self-report measures to understand the types of sedentary behaviours community-dwelling older adults who are frail engage in. To understand the types of sedentary behaviours, I will collect data on the purpose of the sedentary behaviours, the location where the behaviours occur, posture during the behaviours (e.g., sitting), social context (e.g., alone or with others), and time of day the behaviours occur. I will also determine which types of sedentary behaviours (e.g., watching television in the living room while sitting alone in the evening) are associated with negative health outcomes (e.g., falls, anxiety). I will then hold focus groups with participants to understand what behaviours they are willing to modify and how the behaviours can be modified. For the second study, I will assemble a national panel of stakeholders including older adults and their caregivers to establish a consensus on an intervention. The proposed project will result in an intervention that aims to reduce or break up certain types of sedentary behaviours associated with negative health outcomes in older adults who are frail."

The goal of the current study is to examine whether alcohol and energy drink consumption is associated with an increased risk for injury over and above alcohol consumption alone, as well as other stimulant use. Data will be collected from a sample of emergency department patients and an approximately equal number of injured and non-injured control subjects will be interviewed on each shift. A breathalyzer sample will be collected in addition to self-reported alcohol consumption to estimate blood alcohol levels. We will obtain data on the exact beverage line, brand, and amount of each energy drink consumed during the six hours prior to injury or first awareness of the medical condition, as well as consumption for one week prior to the emergency department visit. Finally, we examine gender differences and the context surrounding the injury. The results of the study are intended to add to the limited knowledge base on the role of AmED in the risk of injury. This knowledge can be used to inform the public on the potential harms associated with AmEd. Moreover, an increased understanding of risks for injury can lead us to develop interventions to prevent future injury."

This confidence is based on the recent, rapid acceleration of research findings in HIV, our increased understanding of the continuum of care, and our accumulated experience in addressing HIV at the frontline. At the same time, there is tremendous optimism in Canada about the rapidly changing landscape in HCV given that more effective treatments are available in some provinces and imminent in others. New national HCV screening and diagnostic guidelines are on the horizon and new national harm reduction best practice guidelines exist. Newer understanding of sexual transmission of HCV among men who have sex with men has also emerged from research.

Although studies show that the quality of health services offered to and taken up by Indigenous patients is negatively impacted when Western approaches to health and healing are prioritized over Indigenous approaches, Indigenous healing paradigms and practices are excluded from institutionalized healthcare in most parts of Canada. In an attempt to improve the quality of care for Indigenous people, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) has called for greater collaboration between Indigenous and Western healers. Currently, however, there are very few hospitals in Canada that work to bridge Indigenous and Western approaches to healing. In the Northwest Territories (NWT), the need is particularly great. Despite NWT's high proportion of Indigenous residents (51%), there are few initiatives in hospitals that incorporate both Indigenous and Western healing practices. Furthermore, there is a gap in knowledge about how patients and providers currently experience Indigenous and Western healing paradigms in practice. In order to address the TRC's calls for action and improve the quality of health services for Indigenous people and communities in the NWT, it is critical to fill this knowledge gap. My PhD research will use community-based qualitative research methods and the 'two-eyed seeing' approach to (1) examine how healthcare providers and patients in the NWT understand and experience the interaction between Indigenous and Western healing paradigms in hospital settings, and (2) illuminate the assumptions and values underlying these paradigms, which inform the quality of health service provision.

My PhD research builds on a project I conducted with the Stanton Territorial Hospital Elders Council in Yellowknife, NWT. During our work together, the Elders emphasized that Indigenous and biomedical health services may be understood and experienced differently by patients and health providers and that these different understandings can greatly impact the quality of hospital care. Using an Indigenous storytelling methodology that is grounded in two-eyed seeing and postcolonial theory, my research asks: How do Indigenous and non-Indigenous patients, health providers and traditional healers experience and understand Indigenous and biomedical healing practices at Stanton Territorial Hospital? This project will (1) describe participants' stories and experiences of hospital care and the extent to which their stories and experiences are shaped by their understandings of Indigenous and biomedical healing practices; (2) illuminate the extent to which colonial practices and representations shape participant experiences of hospital care; and (3) provide clear recommendations to improve patient care experiences at Stanton Hospital. This project has been created in partnership with Elders, patients, community leaders and health authority officials and will be guided throughout by a Community Advisory Committee to ensure that the project is patient-oriented and abides by ethical practices and community protocols. Ultimately, this research seeks to address the TRC's calls for action and improve health services for Indigenous patients in the NWT by providing clear direction on how to enhance Indigenous and biomedical health service provision at Stanton Hospital."

Indoors, these fine particles will continue to spread through the air in the room and a person can be exposed by a nearby infected person speaking or coughing. In this research, our motivation is to investigate the spread of airborne saliva aerosol particles in classrooms and graduate student offices. Graduate student offices can also also be considered as a good representative of any closed office space. The testbed will be classrooms and offices at the Faculty of Science at McGill University. While the amount of endogenous saliva aerosols is small compared to the overall values of particle concentrations in the air, it is these human-produced saliva particles that are of concern for airborne transmission of COVID-19. Therefore, we propose measurements that will estimate the amount of endogenously versus exogenously generated aerosol particles in occupied classrooms and offices. The classroom measurements will consider the following six occupancy scenarios: (1) 20 males and ventilation system on; (2) 20 females and ventilation system on, (3) 10 males and 10 females and ventilation system on; and (4-6) same as (1-3) but ventilation system off. In all cases, a lecturer will be an additional person in the classroom giving a 30 min talk. The measurements will be initiated 15 min before people enter the classroom to estimate the ambient (i.e., exogenous) concentration values of aerosols. Moreover, the measurements will be performed at different heights and locations in the investigated rooms to estimate how the concentrations vary spatially. In addition, we shall measure air temperature, relative humidity, and CO2 concentrations to support the interpretation of aerosol concentration data. The office measurements will be
performed with 4 graduate students in an office with and without a ventilation system."

SafeCare is an evidence-based in-home parent-training program that is being implemented in U.S. states, in the U.K., and in Belarus. Within Ontario child welfare agencies, however, there currently exist no such evidence-based neglect-specific interventions. The objective of the current proposal is to deliver the SafeCare program in several Ontario agencies (that are representative of diversity in terms of culture and geographic location) and to evaluate important implementation issues such as acceptability and feasibility using multiple informants and mixed methods (interviews, questionnaires). We will also gather information prior to and following completion of the SafeCare program to evaluate the effects on participating families. The current project not only has the potential to impact the health of individual children and families but it also has population health implications. Specifically, child neglect is expensive from a community point of view (medical care, out-of-home placement, poor educational outcomes), and once established, it tends to remain persistent. By evaluating the acceptability, feasibility, and effects of the SafeCare program, our project has significant applied relevance because it may lead to the adoption of this program by Ontario child welfare agencies, which then has the potential to help families and to safeguard against the establishment of child neglect as a chronic societal condition."

For the evaluation, we will gather information from both children and caregivers prior to the SafeCare program and at various time points following program completion. We will use various data collection methods (questionnaires, testing, child welfare data) to examine three research questions: 1) Does the program work differently for families and if so, what factors are associated with better outcomes over time? 2) How does SafeCare work in terms of mechanisms of change (parental improvements in emotion regulation)? and 3) Does participation in SafeCare decrease rates of re-entry into child welfare? The current project not only has the potential to impact the health of individual children and families but it also has population health implications. Specifically, child neglect is expensive from a community point of view (medical care, out-of-home placement, poor educational outcomes) and once established, it tends to remain persistent. By evaluating SafeCare outcomes over a long-term basis and better understanding the ways in which it works, child welfare may continue to invest in this evidence-based program and make refinements to improve its effectiveness"
Looking past 'cure': refining our understanding of the long-term impacts of tuberculosis,"['Romanowski, Kamila']",['N/A'],"['Epidemiology', 'Infection', 'Mixed Methods', 'Tuberculosis']",105000.0,417297,"Tuberculosis (TB) survivors are at high risk of premature mortality following treatment. The mechanisms leading to the increased mortality seen in this population are incompletely characterized, but studies have shown that TB survivors experience chronic morbidity post-treatment, with high rates of respiratory and cardiovascular disease. This growing body of evidence indicates that supporting TB survivors post-treatment completion is a chance to mitigate other morbidity and mortality. 
To support the development and implementation of strategies aimed at improving the long-term health outcomes of TB survivors, we must first improve our understanding of the mechanisms leading to the increased morbidity and mortality in this population. This includes refining our understanding of the unique barriers and needs that face TB survivors and taking a holistic, person-centered approach to care. Collaborating with research partners from the University of British Columbia and the Woolcock Institute of Medical Research, an Australian medical research organisation that works in collaboration with the Vietnam National Tuberculosis Program, I will use social epidemiological methods to (1) identify patient and health system characteristics associated with morbidity and mortality in TB survivors in Vietnam, and (2) investigate how TB survivors in Vietnam view their post-treatment experience. My research project will advance our understanding of the long-term health impacts of TB and will begin to lay the groundwork for interventions that restore and preserve the health and well-being of TB survivors while maintaining a person-centered approach."

Despite the availability of effective treatments, many Canadians do not receive optimal care for these conditions. This may be a result of a number of factors, including reduced access to health services or barriers to care. Given the enormous costs and poor health outcomes associated with these conditions, a coordinated approach to managing these diseases is necessary to improve the health of Canadians living with chronic disease.

There is limited data available in Alberta on perceived unmet health care needs among patients with chronic medical conditions. Given this knowledge gap, the proposed study will incorporate population-based survey data and provincial administrative data sources, to create a risk factor/health determinant profile of patients with chronic disease. This unique method will be used to describe trends in perceived unmet health care needs among adults with chronic medical conditions in Canada and Alberta specifically.  In addition, it will be determined if these unmet needs result in poor health outcomes later in life. These may include increased hospitalizations or death.

This research has important implication for chronic disease management and health policy. Through the use of survey and administrative data, this project will help identify important barriers to effective chronic disease care, and will inform areas for future intervention aimed at enhancing and improving management of those chronic medical conditions."

Why do some children perform well in school and others drop out?  Why are some youths arrested while others never come near the justice system? The population-based Manitoba data enable research on the consequences of birth, childhood, and adolescent experiences for health and well-being over the first 20 years.  Key childhood outcomes include health events, educational performance, contact with the justice system, and poverty in the late teens. Urban/rural/regional differences will be highlighted. Health analyses will include birth outcomes (low birth weight and prematurity), events resulting in hospitalizations, teen pregnancy, and the emergence of mental health problems. Pilot analyses will suggest approaches to other diseases with origins traceable to childhood and adolescence. 

Educational analyses will track school readiness, subsequent standardized testing, being held back, high school grades, and high school dropout. Data incorporating contact with the justice system include all arrests and convictions.  Going on income assistance as a late teen may reflect difficulty in finding work, family poverty, or lack of welfare supports after age 18. 

How do health and social influences play out over the child's first 20 years? These influences include a) prenatal care, as well as parental and sibling health, b)family stress, c) parental contact with the justice system (including domestic violence), d) household poverty, e) neighborhood poverty, f) residential mobility, g) urban versus rural/regional residence, h) social housing. The degree to which predictors of poor young adult outcomes occur early enough to allow the possibility of intervention will be explored. 

We will analyze Manitoba's data on several government projects designed to improve children's wellbeing. Finally, we will cooperate with an Ontario investigator to facilitate two-province comparisons using new Ontario linked social and health data."

Analyzing these records allows us to examine factors that influence the health of Canadians and how we use public services. Until now, researchers have performed these analyses using structured data (such as spreadsheets) that can be easily plugged into statistical programs. However, with the development of new analysis techniques, there is great potential to conduct more in-depth research using unstructured data, such as clinical notes from electronic medical records (EMR). Big data analytics can be used to analyze free text (i.e. natural language). This proposal will employ these new techniques to analyze free text in the health and social data at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy (MCHP).

Big data analytics will allow us to answer broader research questions that will help to improve clinical practice. For example, Canadians sometimes receive unnecessary medications (antibiotics), and undergo unnecessary tests like back x-rays. By developing the tools to analyze clinician's notes (free text) in EMRs, we can examine why these events occur and better understand the role of patients in decision making. Using the extensive person-level data available at MCHP, we will follow patient exposure to antibiotics over time while considering travel history and other contributing factors. Thus, the inclusion of free text analysis adds an additional dimension to our understanding of antibiotic resistance and will help to curb this growing problem.

This research will advance the science of population level data analysis to a new level, adding depth to the research questions we can answer, and supporting the development of evidence-based policy."

Beginning this school year (2008-2009), the vaccine will be offered to girls aged 9-10 (grade 4). While the vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective, parents must give their permission to allow their daughters to be vaccinated. In the past year, there has been much confusion, especially in the media, about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine and significant numbers of parents (up to 50% in some regions of Ontario) have refused the vaccine for their daughters. 

In this study, we will be surveying 1,000 parents across Quebec about why they did or did not allow their daughters to receive the HPV vaccine. We will be asking parents questions about their decision-making process, their knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about the vaccine and testing and screening for HPV in general. We are predicting that parents who refuse the vaccine will feel their daughters are less susceptible to HPV infection, that the HPV vaccine is more harmful than beneficial, and that they will not have received a clear recommendation about the HPV vaccine from their doctor. The results of this study should help public health planners to better inform parents about the vaccine and provide doctors with communication strategies to give informed and clear recommendations to parents."

HPV accounts for 5.2% of the worldwide cancer burden and 90% of genital warts. An effective vaccine has been approved and recommended for both young males and females (aged 9-26 years). In Canada, publicly-funded immunization programs for the HPV vaccine are currently only available to girls aged 9-13 years. Some provinces offer catch-up programs for girls up to 18 years-old. Across Canada, vaccination rates among females are variable and insufficient to protect the entire population. Additionally, uptake rates in males are extremely low (estimated at 1-10%). Parents of boys who wish to obtain the vaccine must often assume the cost (approximately $400-$500 for 3 doses). Therefore, parents must evaluate many factors (e.g., benefits vs. cost, social influences) before deciding whether or not to vaccinate their sons. We are interested in what parents know about HPV and the HPV vaccine, their attitudes towards the vaccine and which factors influence their decision-making process. First, we will conduct a random Canada-wide on-line survey of 3000 parents of boys (aged 9-16) to assess knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about the HPV vaccine. Parents will be grouped according to their stage of adoption in the decision-making process. Second, we will conduct a follow-up study 1 year later to assess whether parents' vaccination decision status has changed and which factors influenced these changes. Furthermore, the survey data will provide us with an estimate of the most recent uptake rates in young Canadian males. This is one of the first longitudinal studies of which we are aware that aims to identify the key factors that influence changes in parents' HPV vaccine decisions over time. This innovative approach will better inform public health strategies and educational interventions towards this important population."

In Canada, the Pap test (smear) is used to monitor changes in the cervix, usually every 2-3 years. Too many women do not participate regularly in screening (defined as underscreened), especially vulnerable groups (e.g., recent immigrants, low household income). A new cervical screening test detects the HPV virus in cervical cells (HPV test), offers greater protection than the Pap test against cervical cancer and permits extending the testing interval to 5 years or more. Provinces are planning to replace the Pap test with the HPV test, but public health authorities are concerned that women are not yet prepared. In 2017, Australia postponed replacing the Pap test with the HPV test because women did not know that HPV causes cervical cancer, were worried that a cancer could be missed due to longer testing intervals and believed that the government only wanted to save money by extending the screening interval. In Canada, we know little about women's information needs and their perceived barriers (fears and worries) regarding the HPV test. As a result, they might hesitate or refuse the HPV test and miss the opportunity of early detection and prevention of cervical cancer.

In this study, we will carry out an internet-based survey of women age 21 to 70 across Canada and ask about their knowledge, attitudes and beliefs, and their willingness and intentions to accept the HPV test. We will use scientifically valid questions to understand perceived benefits and barriers to the HPV test. Our international research team has many years of experience in studying HPV vaccination and HPV testing decision-making. This study is critical for informing public health authorities about how to educate and encourage women to participate in HPV testing in the most sensitive and timely manner with the goal of improving cervical cancer prevention."

Because of this, it is very likely that current vaccination recommendations will change, and booster shots of COVID-19 vaccines will be needed for continued protection against the virus. Younger adults (aged 18-39) have been identified as key spreaders of the virus. They also have the highest rates of vaccine hesitancy (delaying or refusing vaccination). Therefore, to protect Canadians of all age groups, it will be critical to promote vaccination in younger adults for the likely, upcoming COVID-19 booster shots. 

Currently, we are conducting an online study funded by McGill University to evaluate the effectiveness of an altruism-based video intervention we developed to decrease COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Early data shows that the video increases COVID-19 vaccine intentions in unvaccinated young Canadians. 

This study builds on our previous work and aims to randomize 2630 vaccinated Canadians aged 18-39 either to view a version of the altruism-based video, adapted to promote vaccine booster shots to protect others, or to read a text about recommended health behaviours concerning COVID-19 (control group). The goal of this study is to examine the impact of appealing to younger adult Canadians' sense of altruism to increase intentions to receive COVID-19 booster vaccines. 

Our research team has over 15 years of experience studying factors that influence vaccine hesitancy. We are partnering with the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), the National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI), and the Institut National de Santé Publique du Québec (INSPQ) to translate our findings into messages promoting vaccination that could be widely distributed. The results of our study will not only help to protect Canadians against COVID-19, but also prepare for future pandemics and other vaccine-preventable diseases."

This research will build upon the success of the Diabetes Population Risk Tool (DPoRT), which was developed and validated to estimate up to 10-year incidence of diabetes (new diabetes cases) and can be applied to the population or community level using routinely-collected national survey data.  The goal of this study is to build a new risk tool to estimate future obesity burden in the population (Obesity Population Risk Tool - OPoRT), the biggest modifiable risk factor for diabetes in order to better inform prevention strategies targeting upstream risk factors. In addition this study will expand the capability of DPoRT (DPoRT 2.0) by incorporating all dimensions of burden including diabetes prevalence, health care utilization and healthcare costs, which will significantly improve the relevance and usefulness of the tool.  The application of these new tools will be demonstrated by quantifying the impact of intervention strategies to reduce diabetes risk overall and among high-risk ethnic groups and low income populations.

Recognizing that a diabetes prevention strategy must embrace a population health approach, strategies should include interventions targeted at the entire population as well as those at the highest level of diabetes risk and take place at multiple levels, such as the individual, organizational, community, and population levels. However, the optimal balance of the individual, targeted and population-wide strategies that use primary and secondary prevention approaches is still unclear. Furthermore, the literature is limited on the ability of community-wide programs encouraging healthy diet and exercise to reduce the incidence of T2DM. The question remains, what is the optimal approach to diabetes prevention in Canada? In this grant we propose to develop a new approach to inform prevention strategies. Specifically, we plan to use newly developed tools that explicitly consider the population of interest to determine what approach would result in the greatest population benefit in terms of reductions in incidence, prevalence and costs. This new approach challenges existing approaches that largely fail to consider population-wide interventions and rely heavily on the published literature on high risk interventions and fail to consider population impact. In addition, the proposed study will develop new methods to address existing inequities in diabetes risk, including inequities among ethnic minorities and those of low socioeconomic status (SES).

We plan to focus on two dimensions of residential mobility: frequency of moves (residential instability) and direction of moves (whether a move is to a better- or worse-off neighbourhood). The frequency of moves describes whether a person moves often and can signify unstable housing and potential hardship. The direction of move describes whether a family's neighbourhood environment is improved after moving, compared to their past neighbourhood. Both frequency and direction of moves can have important consequences for health.

Developing Novel Urban Residential Mobility Indicators to Advance Environmental Measurements for Health: Applications for Premature Mortality in Canadian Cities,"['Rosella, Laura C']","['Brook, Jeffrey R', 'Chen, Hong', 'Mah, Sarah M', 'Pagalan, Lief', 'Siddiqi, Arjumand']","['Cities', 'Housing', 'Population Health', 'Prediction', 'Residential Mobility']",100000.0,467827,"Residential mobility (i.e., moving) is a common experience among people living in cities and an important but often overlooked social determinant of health. Postal code information from Canadian tax return data can be used to measure residential mobility. By linking tax information to data on health outcomes, measures of residential mobility can be used to understand its effects on health and support decision-makers by providing quantitative evidence to inform city planning and policy. Our research will create the first-ever standard indicators of residential mobility, based on historical postal code data, for health research in Canadian cities. We will develop the indicators using national data, validate them by comparing them to gold-standard data from Ontario's health care system, and use them to enhance our team's existing population health planning tool for premature mortality. 
We plan to focus on two dimensions of residential mobility: frequency of moves (residential instability) and direction of moves (whether a move is to a better- or worse-off neighbourhood). The frequency of moves describes whether a person moves often and can signify unstable housing and potential hardship. The direction of move describes whether a family's neighbourhood environment is improved after moving, compared to their past neighbourhood. Both frequency and direction of moves can have important consequences for health. By creating new, standardized measures for these two dimensions of residential mobility, we will provide others working in urban health research and planning with a valuable tool to use in their future work. Incorporating the measures into population heath prediction models will provide our city partners with meaningful evidence and tools to inform policy and planning decision-making."

CanChild has been exploring using Our Favourite Words with three child health/social services organizations in Ontario and Manitoba, Canada, and Auckland, New Zealand, who work with Indigenous families (First Nations and Maori). We have learned that before advocating for use of Our Favourite Words with Indigenous families, we first need to explore whether the framework is relevant and culturally safe. We propose a relationship-building and planning project to explore the relevance and cultural safety of Our Favourite Words, specifically related to First Nations communities in Ontario and Manitoba. Our team approach will involve experts in Western and First Nations child health. We will bring together service providers (First Nations and non-First Nations), researchers, trainees, and First Nations Knowledge Keepers to: 1) build relationships and form an integrated team; 2) explore ideas of 'disability', child development, and approaches to health and wellbeing from First Nations and Western viewpoints (using Our Favourite Words as the Western framework), to look at connections, similarities, and differences; and 3) identify an action plan to explore if and how Our Favourite Words can be used in relevant and culturally safe ways. We will do this through an in-person event in Winnipeg, Manitoba (April 2023) and monthly Zoom meetings (May - December 2023). This grant provides the opportunity to invest in relationship-building, co-learn about and bridge connections between Western and First Nations ways of knowing and doing, and plan next steps to explore the relevance and cultural safety of Our Favourite Words for First Nations families in Ontario and Manitoba."

Its effects can be halted or minimized if we adopt proper, flexible protective measures until a vaccine or treatment is available. But how do we increase the use of protective measures, such as hand washing and physical distancing, and promote the adoption of new measures, such as mask wearing and rotating schedules, as the economy reopens? 

People have a strong tendency to make choices that lead to immediate and certain rewards, while avoiding losses and placing less value on rewards that require waiting or that are uncertain, even when rewards are larger. These biases in our decision-making affect how likely we are to change our immediate behaviours in order to protect ourselves and other people. For over a decade, our team has studied this form of decision-making in Canada and parts of the world that were devastated early on by the pandemic (Italy), or that differed in their approaches to containing it (USA, New Zealand). We have succeeded in identifying effective ways to change these tendencies that can easily and rapidly be carried out, with high potential to make a real and sustained impact on the global fight against COVID-19. 

The aims of the proposed research are to 1. characterize and track biases in decision-making around people's willingness to use protective measures, and 2. optimize a scientifically based intervention that can help people overcome biased decision-making by training them to imagine personal scenarios. We also will determine the effects of workplace learning of COVID-19 health and safety measures on changes in decision-making and behaviour through our access to a pool of over 2.8 million frontline workers receiving such training. With the Public Health Agency of Canada as our Knowledge User, we can translate our findings into guidelines on when and how to safely lift restrictions on everyday activities while still under the threat of COVID-19."

This form of abuse has been associated with a wide range of physical and mental health concerns. In order to effectively address these issues and provide appropriate treatment, it is crucial that research begin to examine factors potentially mediating the relationship between child sexual abuse and health. 
One such factor may be the attachment security of abuse survivors. Attachment theory suggests that relationships with caregivers in early childhood influence similar behavioural patterns in later intimate relationships. In the case of child sexual abuse, normal attachment patterns are thought to be disrupted, particularly when the perpetrator of abuse is also the child's caregiver. In addition, insecure attachment styles have been linked to poorer physical health. The current study will examine the interactions between child sexual abuse, attachment styles, and physical health outcomes. Understanding factors that might influence the development of health problems can aid in structuring preventative programs as well as the course of treatment for survivors of child sexual abuse."

In British Columbia we have created a program that is working to improve detection and management of this disease. The program focuses on the development and transfer of new technology to community dental practices and the establishment of clinics for patient referral for evaluation and treatment. However, many of the individuals who are most at risk for developing such cancers will not be seen in these facilities. The goal of this project is to create a team of experts and community representatives that will create a research program focused on assessing and planning interventions for vulnerable communities that will fall outside of the scope of this developing program. For this project, we have identified 4 participant groups: South Asian immigrants, the Vancouver Downtown Eastside, Aboriginal communities, and groups who are in rural and remote regions of BC so are far from cancer control services. These 4 groups represent communities of people with low socioeconomic status, different ethnic backgrounds, or living in different geographic regions where risk factors, barriers to accessing services, and rates of disease are much higher. Our project will involve the development of partnerships with members and institutions in these communities to better understand their needs and develop research plans for control this disease. At the same time, we will be building linkages across Canada and internationally.

However, this evidence is often not considered sufficiently when political decisions about environmental regulations that would improve these health determinants are being made. This is partly because researchers mostly rely on ineffective knowledge translation strategies to influence decision makers such as politicians. This doctoral research program seeks to change the way we conduct knowledge translation in the health sciences with the goal to more successfully influence policy. More specifically, this research will draw on insights from the field of political science where more effective strategies have been developed and apply them to the issue of ecological determinants of health and environmental policies.

In the last three years, highly effective, albeit costly, treatments to cure HCV have been administered to HCV-HIV co-infected patients. These medications significantly lower the risk of liver disease and increase life expectancies among Canadians living with HIV. However, following HCV cure, it is unclear how many people with HIV remain at-risk for reinfection as a result of continued injection drug use, high-risk sexual practices, or exposure at prisons or health-care facilities. The objective of this study was to examine rates and risk factors for HCV reinfection following successful treatment with these new and costly HCV medications in this population. The results from this study will be used to identify characteristics of those at greatest risk for reinfection and to provide health care professionals with information about how to incorporate targeted harm-reduction strategies following HCV treatment in specific populations to reduce the risk of reinfection following cure. Because of the expensive costs of HCV treatment and the large burden that HCV-related disease places on the Canadian health care system, it is important that patients cured from HCV remain risk-free from future infection."

Most infected Canadians are baby boomers, born between 1945-1975, and have been living with HCV for decades. Although effective treatments are available, uptake remains low and HCV-infected Canadians remain at risk for liver disease. As this population ages, they will start experiencing additional non-liver comorbidities, such as diabetes, kidney, and cardiovascular disease. These additional comorbidities will result in increased health-care utilization and expenditures, hospitalizations and mortality among people living with HCV. There are no Canadian estimates of the non-liver-related disease burden associated with HCV. I, therefore, propose to use a combination of public health surveillance and administrative hospital data from British Columbia to develop a population-based study i) examining rates of non-liver comorbidities and health-care service utilization and ii) assess the impact that new HCV treatments will have on these rates. 

Results from this study can be used to improve both clinical and population health practices in Canada. First, results will help inform target treatment strategies by identifying those patients at greatest risk of developing non liver-related comorbidities associated with HCV. Second, this project can help identify areas where additional allocation of resources will be necessary to manage chronic comorbidities associated with aging. Lastly, this study will provide a better understanding of the strengths, challenges and limitations associated with using administrative data for population health research and will help develop the application of novel methodological techniques in epidemiologic research."
Impact of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) direct-acting antiviral therapy on extrahepatic manifestations among HIV co-infected British Columbians engaged in clinical care,"['Rossi, Carmine']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],750.0,391545,"Given similar acquisition risk factors, hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection is common among people living with HIV. With increasing life expectancy and reduced mortality from AIDS-related illnesses, HCV and its long-term sequalae, such as liver disease, have become leading causes of death in this population. There is emerging evidence suggesting that chronic HCV infection can also increase the risk of chronic, non-liver illnesses, including type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular illnesses. New HCV medications, called direct-acting antiviral therapies, are now available in Canada and can cure HCV infection in as little as 8 weeks. To date, there is has been no research in Canada that has examined how these new medications can lower the risk of developing these important chronic non-liver disease and reduce health-care resource utilization among people co-infected with both HIV and HCV. In this research study, we used data from a population-based administrative-linked cohort, the British Columbia Hepatitis Testers' Cohort, to study how frequently six important non-liver illnesses occur between those who were treated for chronic HCV and age and gender matched individuals who were not, since the availability of these new HCV treatments since 2014. We believe this research program is important as it will help to inform clinical decision making for HCV patient care where costly new treatments are often reserved to those with greatest risk of liver disease, without further realization that these treatments may also reduce the risk of non-liver illness."

Asthma and allergies are leading causes of school absenteeism, emergency room visits, and reduced quality of life. Understanding the risk factors for childhood asthma and allergies has important implications for reducing occurrence and burden of these diseases. Experiences in early life, i.e. prenatally or perinatally, ""get under the skin"" and program long-term immune activity in a way that can increase risk for immune-related diseases. One biological mechanism through which this occurs is epigenetic modification of immune cells, which determines whether and by how much immune cells are activated when challenged, e.g. by allergens. The social environment is a potent predictor of health. Although the mother's prenatal social environment has been linked to immune activity in offspring, no studies have tested whether the mother's prenatal social environment serves as a ""cue"" that gets embedded in offspring's immune system via epigenetic modifications, and whether epigenetic modifications affect risk for allergies and asthma. The purpose of this project is to test
this developmental pathway using the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition Study (APrON) data. Maternal social environment data was collected over pregnancy, and offspring were followed-up at 3-months postpartum (blood samples for epigenetic analysis), and at 3- and 5-years of age (allergies and asthma diagnosis). This project will contribute to our understanding of the developmental origins of childhood asthma and allergies, and examine maternal social environment factors that could be intervention targets."

However, the majority of them must rely on outside assistance to create their families, including use of assisted human reproduction (AHR) services.  As a result, LGBT people make up a significant proportion of AHR service users in some parts of Canada (e.g., as reported by one Toronto clinic, up to 30%).
   Despite this high rate of service utilization, much of existing academic literature about LGBT people and AHR services is comprised of position papers debating whether LGBT people should have access to AHR services, based primarily on societal beliefs about the presumed inadequacy of LGBT people as parents.   In contrast, the impact of these societal beliefs on provision of AHR services to LGBT people has not been well studied. 
   The new Assisted Human Reproduction Act includes a non-discrimination clause barring discrimination based on sexual orientation or marital status. In this context, it is critical to determine to what extent AHR services are meeting the family creation needs of Canadian LGBT people.  
   The goal of this qualitative community based participatory research project is to examine the experiences of LGBT people in Ontario who have used AHR services, including barriers and facilitators to access to care, quality of services received and differences across the identity groups of lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans people.  This Ontario-based research project will ultimately inform Canada-wide research about the experiences of LGBT people with AHR services, in order to assist AHR service providers across the country in upholding the AHRA's non-discrimination clause."

In this study, quantitative and qualitative methodology will be used to address these research gaps. A community based research approach, where bisexual people are involved in all parts of the research process will ensure relevance of the project.  Specifically, the study aims: a) to measure the rates of mental health problems in bisexual people  b) to examine which factors are associated with the marginalization of bisexual people c) to examine whether the marginalization experienced by bisexual people is related to mental health status d) to determine whether access to or satisfaction with mental health services is associated with mental health status e) to explore experiences with mental health services and help seeking strategies and f) to combine research results with social action to improve bisexual mental health.  Respondent-driven sampling will be used to identify 800 participants from Ontario, who will complete a survey that includes assessments of mental health status, marginalization variables and mental health service use. Forty participants will be interviewed about the factors enabling them to maintain good mental health. This project will be the most comprehensive study of bisexual mental health conducted to date.

The estimated costs for physical inactivity are even higher at about $CAN 10 billion (Krueger et al., 2014).  This burden is directly attributable to human behavioural 'choices'. The use of quotes on the term 'choices' is most deliberate. The suite of choices that are possible for individuals is entirely related to what the environment offers up - public transit, foot paths and open staircases, for example, to support walking; or a grocer providing high quality, affordable healthy food instead of unhealthy offerings; and, knowledge of and adequate time for the preparation of food.

Pedestrian injuries are in fact, one of the leading causes of injury worldwide.  
   Inactivity in children who don't walk or cycle, however, contributes to the growing problem of obesity and health related diseases.  Increasing walking if planned poorly, can lead to injury.  Unsafe roads or perception of unsafe roads will interfere with any effort to encourage walking to school.  This research will look at how the safety of the physical (built) environment around schools can promote active school transportation (AST) and decrease the risk of child pedestrian injury.  It will also investigate how parents' perceptions of injury influence whether their children walk/bike to school. This research will include analysis including mapping of child pedestrian/cyclist collisions to determining where and when they occur.  Analysis of police collision data will be done to find out how the built environment influences where collisions occur. Observations of how children get to school, the safety of the school built environment including measurement of traffic speed, and surveys of parents regarding how dangerous they think it is for their children to walk/cycle to school will be done. It is important that all these factors be examined together, so that the risk of injury risk and/or the perception of risk will not be a barrier to a healthier more active lifestyle for Toronto's children.

AST may also increase children's exposure to road traffic. However, AST can be increased without increasing pedestrian motor vehicle collisions (PMVC) as long as the built environment is safe. Social risk factors (e.g. income, immigrant status) may affect individual behaviour related to AST and PMVC. Children from low income areas may walk more yet are at a greater risk of PMVC, because they are less likely to benefit from measures that can minimize risk. Traffic calming for example, is traditionally allocated according to public request, and is more likely to be found in higher income neighborhoods.  
This project will examine area-level social risk factors (i.e. material deprivation, ethnic concentration and immigration characteristics) and their relationship to AST and child PMVC. The effect of road design (i.e. walkability, transit accessibility, vehicle speed/volume and traffic calming density) on the relationship between area-level social risk factors and AST and child PMVC will be examined. Equitable design of safe roadways has the potential to change the social inequities in AST and child PMVC. Toronto's new Vision Zero Road Safety Plan 2.0, has committed to reduce these inequities through changes to the roadway built environment. Walking must be safe to change individual behaviour related to active transportation. Built environment interventions are the most successful approach to improve safety. The results will have policy implications in terms of equitable interventions related to the design of safer streets and Toronto's Vision Zero Road Safety Plan."

Pandemic-related stay-at-home and physical distancing policies led to great reductions in police-reported collisions during the early stages of the pandemic. However, with the progression of the stages of re-opening, reports of collision fatalities have been emerging, likely due to reported increases in speeding. 
We will assemble collision data from March 2017-April 2023 in 4 Canadian cities - Toronto, Montreal, Calgary and Vancouver and across provinces. The objectives are to 1)determine the effects of the implementation of COVID-19 'stay home' and physical distancing policies on rates of road traffic deaths and injuries 2) determine the effects of relaxation of COVID-19 'stay home' policies (while maintaining physical distancing policies) on rates of road traffic deaths and injuries 3)determine the effects of specific COVID-19 related local roadway mitigation strategies on road traffic injuries and deaths (e.g. lane closures, new bicycle lanes). Collisions and specific new local road safety strategies, such as bike lanes and road closures will be mapped. Collision rates before the implementation of stay-at-home and physical distancing policies, during implementation, and after the relaxation of policies will be compared as well as before and after the implementation of specific road interventions. Data will be analyzed by age, sex, injury severity and travel mode.  
Cities now have a critical opportunity to institute policies to create safer walking and cycling environments. This pan-Canadian team brings decades of experience having collaborated on applied interdisciplinary research related to active transportation, motor vehicle collisions, road safety policy and the built environment. Results will be shared and disseminated through a variety of key stakeholders including; the municipalities and Parachute, the national injury prevention charity."

As part of Guelph's TMP, a Vision Zero (VZ) road safety philosophy was adopted that guides staff on using a safe systems approach to implement and evaluate road safety interventions to achieve zero injuries and fatalities on Guelph's roads. These initiatives align perfectly with the theme of the Planning Grant for Implementing Healthy Urban Policy related to active transportation and public space. Guelph's objective is to work with an established researcher in this area, Dr. Linda Rothman from Toronto Metropolitan University, to learn best practices with a safety and equity lens, to help inform our new Complete Streets Design Guidelines, Pedestrian and Cycling Master Plans and our Traffic Calming Policy. Our knowledge mobilization plan will include a city tour for councillors, public health and city staff and representatives from equity-seeking organizations, followed by a design charette and a presentation/panel discussion to a wider audience related to lessons learnt and an action plan. The knowledge gained will support collaboration between city leaders and researchers to co-develop and evaluate interventions that create healthy urban spaces and promote safe and equitable mobility for all residents.

As such, expanding on prior research documenting health disparity in this study cannot be done.
    The Our Health Counts project used a new and highly advanced method to recruit First Nations participants, called Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS).  This approach involved giving coupons to study participants who would then recruit other First Nations community members.  These newly recruited people were then provided with coupons to recruit others until a total of 554 adults were recruited into the study.  This approach provided important health disparity information, including findings such as the proportion of First Nations who are diabetic (16 % vs. 5 % in the general population), have high blood pressure (26 % vs. 20%) and have been diagnosed with heart disease (8 % vs. 3 %).
    Typically, these analyses would represent the starting point for more research to explore potential causes that might be related to these diseases. However, in the context of RDS studies, appropriate statistical methods to do this have not yet been developed.
    Given the current limitations in our ability to analyze this data and to further understand health disparity in Aboriginal communities, we have two main goals: 1.  To develop new statistical methods which are appropriate for this new, RDS data type; and 2.  To apply these statistical methods to examine diabetes, high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease.  That is, we want to learn which physical, social and environmental factors may be linked to being diagnosed with these chronic conditions.
    While we have shown large disparities between the health of urban Aboriginal people and the general population, the development and application of these new statistical methods will paint a more complete picture of which factors affect Aboriginal health."

Due to existing social factors such as poor quality, overcrowded housing, homelessness, and lack of clean running water, infections like COVID-19 can spread quickly. There are also big gaps in data about how COVID-19 is spreading among Indigenous peoples, especially in cities. To address this, we will use information from existing studies about the health of Indigenous peoples living in cities to learn more about COVID-19 spread and it's impacts.

The Our Health Counts Toronto, London and Thunder Bay studies used social networks to find Indigenous community members living in these cities. These studies were done by the Indigenous community for the Indigenous community. Our methods allowed us to gather information about the needs of the entire Indigenous populations in these cities, even those who don't use services regularly. By linking the Our Health Counts studies to the provincial COVID-19 database at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES), our team will use new statistical methods to accurately estimate the rate of COVID-19 transmission for Indigenous peoples in these cities. We will also check for increases in mortality rates, due both to COVID-19 itself and gaps in access to health care for acute (e.g. heart attack) and chronic (e.g. diabetes) health conditions.

In partnership with Indigenous community health services, our research team will improve statistical methods and produce currently unavailable information regarding the burden of COVID-19 and its rate of spreading through the urban Indigenous communities living in Toronto, London and Thunder Bay, Ontario.  This information is important as Indigenous Peoples are highly mobile between urban areas and First Nations reserves, and rural and remote Métis and Inuit communities.  Improving our understanding of COVID-19 in urban centres can reduce its risk of spreading within and from these cities."

There is a lack of reliable health information for these First Peoples. For example, reported population sizes are commonly smaller than true counts. The result is large gaps in services and missed opportunities to improve health and well-being. It is important to work together to 'count in' these large, diverse, and often overlooked populations of First Peoples.  

Our Health Counts projects have been run in partnership with urban Indigenous service providers in six Ontario cities over 15 years. Together we have created the largest source of health and wellness information available for First Peoples living in Canadian cities. To ensure high quality data, we used a new statistical method called respondent-driven sampling. I am a statistician with over 10 years of experience working with Indigenous communities. I have created and implemented new statistical methods to study pressing health priorities for First Peoples living in cities, including diabetes, heart disease and COVID-19.

Under the leadership of Indigenous community partners, this research program builds on the Our Health Counts studies. We will develop and refine new statistical methods to: 1) Create the most accurate counts of First Peoples living in cities. This is important as all health and social planning programs require correct population counts to be successful; 2) Measure the long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on chronic conditions and mental health outcomes like diabetes, kidney disease, depression, and anxiety; 3) Create a new Indigenous health data training program to train the next generation of Indigenous health researchers and empower them to tell their own stories.

In summary, this program will advance high-quality information for First Peoples living in cites. Working together, we can develop and share important, accurate and timely information that will contribute to enhanced health and well-being."

According to the World Health Organization, there are 360 million people carrying HBV worldwide, causing 600,000 deaths each year. A significant number of HBV infected individuals become chronic carriers, increasing the risk for transmission and developing cirrhosis and liver cancer. Canada is considered a low endemic country; however the prevalence of chronic HBV varies greatly among subpopulations, further widening the existing health disparities. Although the overall number of newly acquired HBV infection has declined since the implementation of the universal vaccination program, immigration from high endemic countries has contributed to the increasing numbers of chronic HBV observed in various subpopulations. A study estimated that 250,000 people in Canada are infected with HBV, 70% of which are immigrants. Immigrants form an increasing proportion of the Canadian population with a significant number residing in B.C. In 2008, the B.C Ministry of Health stated there are 30,000 to 60,000 individuals who live with chronic HBV in the province. Due to the lack of HBV immunization programs, many immigrants from high endemic countries remain susceptible to HBV and may be in close contact with family members who are infected, raising great public health concerns. HBV has also been strongly linked with causing liver cancer among various immigrant groups. There is a continued need for effective HBV screening, testing and surveillance among immigrant populations. With the changing migration patterns in Canada and the increasing rates of chronic HBV in high endemic countries, it is essential to determine the rate of chronic HBV among immigrant populations in B.C. This will allow researchers to closely monitor the disease, develop preventive measures to decrease the number of advanced cases and liver cancer among immigrant populations as well as to assess current health policies."

It affects digestion and absorption of food, and elimination of waste. Its causes are unknown. After many studies, researchers have only been able to identify a few risk factors with certainty. They include family history of the disease and cigarette smoking. The causes of this disease are still unknown, but some researchers think that certain times in life could be more critical for the development of the disease. 

Our goal is to clarify the causes of disease, and identify which ones could be targeted by prevention program. We will study medical, lifestyle, and psychosocial factors from the time of birth until adult years. We will determine if they are linked to the development of the disease. These factors are for example: prematurity, breastfeeding, antibiotic use, diet, smoking, stress. We will also study carefully when these factors occur during a person's life. For this research, we will use a cohort of about 400,000 persons born between 1970 and 1974, in the province of Quebec, Canada. We created this cohort for a previous study by linking together some provincial administrative databases. Data on medical services and hospitalizations for inflammatory bowel disease were obtained until 2014 and will be used to determine who is affected by the disease. Then, we will ask about 2600 persons of the cohort to complete a web survey to obtain additional information. Among the participants, we will compare persons who have the disease to those who do not, and evaluate what are the key moments throughout their lives when these factors could increase the risk of the disease.

This research will help understanding which factors increase the risk of inflammatory bowel disease by detecting if there are certain times in a person's life that are especially important. We will produce crucial information to establish prevention programs."

Recent studies have suggested that it may also protect against COVID-19 and prevent mortality from this disease. These recent investigations were limited because they only looked at correlations between having a BCG vaccination program and COVID-19 mortality rates. Studies need to be conducted in populations where there are vaccination, disease and mortality registries, so that we know exactly who was vaccinated, who had the disease and who died. In the Province of Quebec, a BCG vaccination campaign took place between 1949 and the mid-1970s. The vaccine was offered for free to newborns and schoolchildren, and vaccination information is compiled in a registry. 

The goal of our study is to determine if BCG vaccination in early life is associated with decreased mortality and with risk of infections over the life course. We will study selected bacterial and viral infections, and also infections with SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19.

The study population consists of 400,000 persons. This is almost all individuals born in Quebec between 1970 and 1974. They are now aged 47 to 51 years old. Data was already obtained from provincial administrative databases until 2014, including BCG vaccination status, sociodemographic factors, and death if applicable. We will obtain data on mortality and on use of health services for infections from provincial databases until 2021. We will compare the rates of mortality and of infections (with bacterial and viral infections and with COVID-19 separately) among persons who received the BCG vaccine and those who did not. 

There are few places in the world where this type of study can be done. Our unique setting will allow us to answer several important questions on BCG vaccination, helping us understand its effects beyond tuberculosis prevention."

Le Québec a eu, à compter de 1949, un programme de vaccination à visée universelle ciblant les nouveau-nés et les écoliers. Le registre développé par Armand Frappier, numérisé pour les années 1956-1992, offre une opportunité unique de mesurer l'efficacité à très long terme du BCG, une question de santé mondiale qui sera cruciale le jour où d'autres vaccins seront disponibles et où il faudra repenser les stratégies de vaccination à travers le monde. 

Cette étude vise à mesurer l'efficacité à très long terme (15 à 66 ans post-vaccination) de la protection conférée par le BCG. On comparera les antécédents de vaccination avec le BCG pour des cas de tuberculose et des témoins indemnes de cette maladie, chez des gens âgés de 46 à 66 ans. Les cas seront identifiés grâce au fichier des maladies à déclaration obligatoire. Les témoins, de même sexe et même âge, seront tirés à partir d'un fichier de la Régie d'assurance maladie du Québec.

Nous escomptons trouver 400 cas de tuberculose qui seront appariés avec 2000 témoins. La vaccination antérieure au BCG (âge, nombre de doses) proviendra du registre BCG. L'analyse sera faite selon l'intervalle entre la vaccination et l'évènement, ce qui nous permettra de voir si l'effet du BCG persiste au cours du temps. 

Si cette étude confirme l'efficacité à très long terme du BCG, un hypothétique nouveau vaccin devra s'ajouter au BCG et non le remplacer. Ces résultats seront importants pour la planification des futurs programmes de vaccination contre la tuberculose, à l'échelle mondiale."
HIV Transmission and Criminalization: Can Science in 2010 Change the Law?,"['Routy, Jean-Pierre']","['Lebouché, Bertrand', 'Thompson, David']","['Criminalization Of Hiv', 'Hiv Transmission']",3000.0,208862,"The criminalization of non-disclosure may seem logical to many as it is the person's responsibility to disclose his or her HIV status. The HIV positive individual is privy to important information that affects the precise balance of risk inherent in unprotected sexual relations. Where non-disclosure is the result of deliberate, conscious deceit, criminal courts in Canada clearly favour harsher sentencing. However criminalization carries with it significant public health consequences: the risk of deterring individuals from seeking HIV testing by inducing fear of incarceration, an adverse effect on patient-provider relationships, a risk of lulling society into a false sense of protection by criminal law and the infringement of civil liberties. The fear of legal consequences may make individuals at risk less inclined to accept an offer of HIV testing, less inclined to seek the services of sexually transmitted infection clinics, and/or less inclined to discuss their HIV status with sexual and drug-injecting partners. In the criminal prosecution of HIV transmission/exposure there still remains the difficult issues of proof, knowledge, intent, and discriminatory application of the law. The definition of the requisite level of risk to secure conviction remains imprecise due to a wide variation in lower court decisions. The Canadian AIDS Society considers that the extent of responsibility can be mitigated by the degree of risk exposure(i.e. decresed level of responsibility when a comdom is used). We will have short presentations from experts and a question/answer period to critically examine the issues concerning the idea of antiretroviral therapy as HIV prevention, as it was recently shown that antiretrovirals decrease risk of transmission, and its potential role in changing HIV criminalization in the province of Quebec."
Personal stories of decolonization as education for social work practitioners,"['Rowe, Gladys L']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2150.0,315321,"Intergenerational implications of colonization upon the lives of Indigenous peoples in Canada have produced ruptures and disconnections from a sold foundation of identity and belonging. Sense of identity, cultural continuity, and belonging are critical to health and wellbeing. This paper will focus on research that explored experiences of individuals who possess both Indigenous (Cree) and non-Indigenous ancestry in the development of their identities. Natural conversations facilitated sitting with and listening to Cree Elders and engaging with mixed-ancestry Cree individuals about the stories of their identities. The overall goal of this research was to create a space for individuals to express the impacts of systems, relationships and the ways in which people come to understand their overall wellbeing and connection to ancestors through stories in personal identity development.

Elders shared stories of disconnection and intergenerational experiences that caused diversion from the natural progression of Cree identity development as impacts of colonization. From this they also shared their stories of re-connection and healing. Common experiences expressed by participants highlighted the impact of colonization on their understanding and expression of themselves as individuals and as members of larger community, the complexity that underlies their experiences of identity, and how their understanding of wellbeing is connected to healing. Stories shared processes of healing, decolonization and resurgence of Indigenous ways of knowing, being, and doing in reclamation of self. This presentation will outline the educational opportunities provided through personal stories of decolonization and healing for practitioners working in the field of social work."

The use of natural conversations facilitated sitting with and listening to Cree Elders and engaging with the stories of mixed-blood Cree individuals about the stories of their identities. 

Identity is the way that we answer the question who am I? It is a search for a place to belong, to connect to those around us in a way that can provide safety and meaning in how we understand who we are. Individual's search for belonging, membership and ultimately connection is a natural human desire linked to wellbeing and health. My research explored personal stories and those stories of our ancestors, to reconnect us with our essential and authentic selves. 

Elders shared with me stories of disconnection and intergenerational experiences that caused diversion from the natural progression of Cree identity development as impacts of colonization. From this they also shared their stories of re-connection and healing. Common experiences expressed by mixed-blood Cree participants highlighted the impact of colonization on their understanding and expression of themselves as individuals and as members of larger community, the complexity that underlies their experiences of identity, and how their understanding of wellbeing is connected to healing.

"Indigenous ways of knowing, being, doing, and feeling: Praxis for community driven research and evaluation","['Rowe, Gladys L']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2800.0,346566,"Community driven research has shown the potential to positively impact health outcomes for individuals, families, and communities. Considering historical, ongoing, and localized contexts for Indigenous families in Canada, additional impact may come from the inclusion of Indigenous ways of knowing, being, feeling, and doing into research. The implementation of these core principles in research can counter colonial structures, impositions, and assumptions that have perpetuated ""research as usual"". This presentation will share stories from the development and implementation of the Winnipeg Boldness Project, a social innovation initiative founded upon these principles. The project is working towards a Bold Goal: Children and families in Point Douglas will experience dramatically improved wellbeing in all aspects of self: physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual. Ceremony, relationships, and relational accountability have guided the direction of the project from the beginning. This includes in the use of iterative and responsive processes to design and use methodologies and methods that centre voices, experiences, and contexts of families and leaders in the community. For example, community processes to identify and define what success and wellbeing looks and feels like for children and families were a critical starting point for the research. We will consider key areas of learning and adaptation that have occurred in the design and implementation and will suggest how this could further build the field of community driven research founded upon Indigenous methodologies."

The presentation will outline processes incorporated to ensure a participatory framework, the Indigenous principles that provided the foundation for these frameworks, and ongoing activities that contributed to the participation of families as critical voices directing research across various health priorities in the city. Lessons learned include: how to hold space for families to lead the projects, whose voice is being heard, and what resources are being used to support the equitable participation of community members in designing strategies for knowledge gathering, production, and mobilization. Much of this work as used many arts-based methods including photo voice, a tile mosaic, and a starblanket, poetry, mandalas, and collages. These methods have been centred as mechanisms for sharing stories that facilitate connection and understanding. This is a key aspect that can contribute to social change. Reflections on the strengths and challenges posed in using Indigenous methodologies in participatory research in this context will be discussed and opportunities for future learning will be highlighted."

Today, in the wake of colonization, there is an unequal distribution of mental health services for individuals who reside in Ontario's rural, remote, and air access communities. These individuals also face increased mental health challenges for a variety of reasons including; geographic isolation, cross-generational impacts from colonization, discrimination, marginalization, and economic and social conditions that can negatively influence individuals and whole communities. Many First Nations communities across Canada are taking innovative and effective measures to address the mental wellness of members within their communities through community and family-based programs that offer local and culturally relevant approaches to wellness and resilience.  Through the use of an Indigenous research paradigm, this project aims to shed light on the Weeneebayko Area Health Authority's (WAHA) mental health system's response to MHA needs within the James and Hudson Bay regions for young adults aged 18 to 29. This project will incorporate a mixed-methods design. The three objectives of this work include: 1) Describing WAHA physician perspectives on the MHA care of patients who have been given a Form 1; 2) Determining the rates of Emergency Department (ED) visits for young adults in WAHA who have experienced a Form 1; and 3) Documenting the experiencing of providing MHA care to young adults from the perspectives of front-line workers who offer in-community MHA care and services."

Separation from their families and communities, job loss, and limited social and educational opportunities are adding to the sense of isolation many urban Indigenous peoples already feel. 

In response, the Under One Sky Friendship Centre in Fredericton, New Brunswick has been able to quickly develop and launch the Sakelemelsowaken Family Success Program, which consists of two pilot wellness initiatives to address the unmet and exacerbated needs of the regional Indigenous community: one is an Indigenous nursing outreach program to support the strengths and enhance the success of Indigenous families; the other, an Indigenous mental wellness counselling and referral program that serves everyone who seeks support. 

This research project will entail a community-driven evaluation of this COVID-19 related wellness program. The evaluation will help identify and assess priority goals and outcomes, from the point of view of the Friendship Centre, its clients, Elders and other stakeholders. This will inform adjustments in services in order to best meet the needs of Fredericton's Indigenous community; improve our understanding of the immediate impacts of COVID-19 on urban Indigenous populations, including any differences in impacts faced by men, women, children and gender diverse individuals; and provide much needed evaluation and improvement data for wellness services of this nature, which are common across Canada. Finally, it will build capacity within the Friendship Centre to better collect data and evaluate their own programming going forward."
"Depression, Intimate Partner Violence and Perinatal Health in Aboriginal Women and Infants","['Roy, Amrita']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal Health', 'Depression', 'Discrimination', 'Gender', 'Health Policy', 'Intimate Partner Violence (Ipv)', 'Manitoba)', 'Maternal', 'Perinatal', 'Pregnancy', 'Saskatchewan', 'Tri-Provincial (Alberta']",105000.0,185003,"Aboriginal women experience poorer physical and mental health, and more adverse pregnancy outcomes, than non-Aboriginal women.  The plight of Aboriginal women is further aggravated by compounded oppression involving race and gender. While intimate partner violence (IPV) is a serious issue in all populations, Aboriginal women experience abuse at considerably higher rates.  Victimized women are at much higher risk for physical and mental health problems, including depression. IPV often increases during pregnancy, and depression during pregnancy can have serious consequences for maternal and child outcomes. The associated continuous elevation of stress-related hormones can negatively impact the mother's physical and mental health, and can increase the risk of preterm birth and low birthweight. Our research goal is to understand the intersections of IPV and depression in pregnant Aboriginal women, so that healthcare policies and programs can better respond to their needs. We hypothesize that 1) the rates of pre- and post-natal depression will be higher in Aboriginal women than reported for other populations; and 2) Aboriginal women who report IPV will have higher rates of pre- and post-natal depression than those who do not, when other risks for depression are controlled. We propose to conduct a study following pregnant Aboriginal women in urban areas and on reserves in Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Through personal interviews and health record reviews, we will collect data on pre- and post-natal depression, IPV, risk factors for depression, and pregnancy outcomes for the mother and infant. The associations among risk factors for perinatal depression are presently poorly understood, especially in the context of IPV, and for Aboriginal women. A better understanding can lead to better strategies for detection, intervention and even prevention. Thus, this area of research holds potential importance for addressing intersecting problems in Aboriginal women's health."

Indigenous women experience poorer health relative to other women in Canada; this is related to colonization and ongoing social disparities, as well as challenges in accessing health and social services that meet needs. However, Indigenous women also hold remarkable strength, with traditional culture and
strong community serving as sources of healing. Good quality, diverse, and comprehensive data are required to support evidence-based development of policies, programs, and services that meet the needs of urban Indigenous women and families. Research on this topic should be community-driven, participatory, culturally appropriate, culturally safe, and centered in respectful collaborative research partnerships with Indigenous peoples. Research on this
topic should also create knowledge and data that will be useful for individuals, communities, healthcare and social service providers, and policymakers. This planning project will bring together key stakeholders to map out gaps in knowledge and data, and create a research action plan, to better understand and more effectively address perinatal mental health in urban Indigenous women in southeastern Ontario. Academic researchers at Queen's
University and University of Ottawa are partnering with local Indigenous peoples and with various community organizations in southeastern Ontario to do this project. In addition to producing a research action plan, the planning process itself will also bring together stakeholders and form a network for possible continued collaboration to improve Indigenous maternal-child health in the southeast Ontario region. Moreover, the insights gained and products created from this project can also be useful for understanding and addressing
perinatal mental health in Indigenous women in other parts of Canada."

High eye pressure is thought to be caused by both biological factors (like genetics and metabolites) and factors related to the environment (like smoking and diet). Recent papers have identified several genes and a metabolite, ascorbic acid, that are related to eye pressure. However, most diseases are multifactorial meaning there is more than one cause and the causes interact together. No studies have reported on how genes, metabolites, and environmental factors interact together to affect eye pressure. Using data from 20,000 adults in the CLSA Comprehensive Cohort, we plan to investigate this question. Better understanding of the genetic, metabolomic, and environmental causes of high eye pressure could help to further understand the causes of POAG, to prevent POAG, and to develop more effective therapies."

Ces associations ont été observées de nombreuses fois chez des enfants, des adolescents, de jeunes adultes et chez des adultes d'âge mûr. Or, malgré toutes ces recherches, très peu d'information existe en ce qui a trait à l'impact de l'image corporelle sur les comportements alimentaires des aînés et ce, même s'il s'agit du groupe de population qui affiche la croissance la plus forte au Canada.

L'objectif de notre recherche est donc d'estimer les proportions d'insatisfaction corporelle et de comportements alimentaires malsains (mesuré par une obésité ou une anorexie du vieillissement) chez des aînés canadiens et d'observer les associations entre ces variables. Pour étudier cette question, nous avons eu recours à 1793 aînés canadiens âgés de 67 à 83 ans. Dans cet échantillon, l'insatisfaction corporelle est de 46.2 % alors que la prévalence d'obésité et d'anorexie du vieillissement est respectivement de 25.3 % et 9.0 %. Nous avons finalement noté qu'une insatisfaction corporelle triple le risque d'être obèse chez les aînés canadiens.

Puisqu'une insatisfaction corporelle est associée à une augmentation du risque d'obésité et puisqu'elle est si présente chez les aînés canadiens, nous croyons qu'une action de santé publique doit s'attarder à cette problématique pratiquement inexplorée. Une action de santé publique pourrait comporter des bénéfices individuels du point de vue de la santé des canadiens mais aussi avoir un impact populationnel du point de vue des coûts associés aux soins de santé consommés par ces individus."

The specific objectives of my program of research are to: 1) Deepen the current understanding of the effects of labour force participation and psychosocial work conditions on health outcomes, access to care, and mortality of people with HIV; 2) Evaluate the demographic, health, work context and psychosocial determinants of return to work and job retention in people with HIV that will inform employment / health programs, services and policies; and 3) Work with stakeholders to implement and evaluate a rigorous knowledge-to-action strategy designed to improve workforce participation, employment rates, productivity and health outcomes for people with HIV and other episodic illnesses."

The proposed research adopts a multiple case study approach to systematically document provincial regulatory models for the implementation of cannabis policies, programs and practices, and the community concerns and intended strategies to adopt in response to the legalization of cannabis for non-medical use. Drawing on three distinct qualitative data sources (i.e., semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and policy documents), we will examine how a sample of provinces and Indigenous and racialized communities are viewing and responding to the impending cannabis regulatory frameworks and anticipated impacts. The provinces selected for this project are British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec. Specific communities that we will engage within these provinces include Indigenous (First Nations, Inuit, and Métis) and racialized communities (African Canadian, South Asian, East Asian, and Latino) due to the disproportionate impact drug policies have historically had on these populations.

We need to engage with these communities to promote and enhance health equity. 

Objectives include: 1) To give voice to and document IRER community members' experiences and perspectives on the relationship between cannabis and mental health; 2) To develop a greater understanding of IRER community members' mental health service interactions and utilization in relation to cannabis and mental health; and 3) To examine whether and how gender interacts with other social identities to influence perspectives and experiences with cannabis and mental illness. 

We will conduct a qualitative study with 80 members of IRER communities (e.g., Afro Caribbean, African, Indigenous, Latino, South Asian, and Southeast Asian) who have used cannabis monthly in the last year and accessed mental health/addiction services for a known psychiatric diagnosis in the past year. We will use purposive sampling and focus on the primary client base of the Centre for Addiction and Mental health (CAMH) and province-wide partners to include community agencies and remote locations.

Our objectives are to: 1) Qualitatively explore the relationship between cannabis and mental illness within priority populations who live with HIV and consume cannabis; 2) Identify opportunities to improve the experiences of priority populations when accessing mental health and addiction services; 3) Mobilize research findings through national partners to reach community-based agencies and HIV Service Organizations to support their programmatic needs; and 4) Solidify existing partnerships and develop new ones to seek additional funding for interventions that promote a healthier relationship with cannabis and optimizes policies, programs, and services that improve the lives of people with HIV. 

As part of a partnership between the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) and the Canadian AIDS Society (CAS)-including people with lived experience, national organizations, and peer networks-the overall goal of this community-based research project is to conduct a qualitative study with members of priority populations within the HIV community. We will conduct 8 virtual focus groups/talking circles and 40 one-to-one interviews to explore emerging themes and to accommodate participants' preferences. 

Our research team has considerable experience conducting collaborative research with people with HIV and people who use drugs, with a fundamental commitment to community engagement.

Outre les traitements, des facteurs psychologiques pourraient affecter le système immunitaire et prédisposeraient les patients à développer des infections, comme le suggèrent les nombreuses études ayant montré un lien entre le stress et un moins bon fonctionnement immunitaire. Les perturbations du sommeil, fréquentes chez les personnes atteintes de cancer, notamment chez celles ayant un cancer gynécologique (33 à 68%) et du sein (42 à 69%), influenceraient aussi le système immunitaire, mais les impacts de ces changements immunitaires sur la santé ont rarement été évalués.

The total number of Canadian Aboriginal people living with HIV (including AIDS patients) in 2005 was 3500, which by 2008 increased by 24% to 4900. The 2006 Census reported that Aboriginal people represented only 3.8% of the Canadian population, but in 2008 accounted for 8.0% of the country's prevalent infections. The disparities in HIV prevalence between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginals must be considered when evaluating the HIV epidemic in Canada. The objective of this project is to develop an informed epidemiological analysis of HIV status and testing in Aboriginal populations using information from the 2001 and 2006 Aboriginal Peoples Survey. The analysis will include all three main Aboriginal groups (North American Indian, Métis and Inuit identity or ancestry), excluding people living in settlements or on reserves. We also plan to analyze the unique characteristics of the HIV epidemic among female Aboriginal people, as compared to male. Factors associated with HIV positive and HIV negative people will be statistically compared, and changes between 2001 and 2006 survey periods will be analyzed. This research is being conducted in a contributing effort to that which is necessary to characterize the unique needs of the First Nations, Inuit and Métis populations, in order to identify and analyze culturally appropriate and effective approaches to HIV prevention, care, treatment and support."

Attending a pharmacy daily to receive these medications makes it difficult to reintegrate into the community, and is a main reason why individuals discontinue treatment. A new opioid addiction medication, extended-release buprenorphine (XR-BUP; trade name Sublocade) is an injection individuals receive once a month which considerably reduces the number of required clinic visits, and may therefore be beneficial for correctional populations. However, limited Canadian information exists on incarcerated individuals' experiences and perceptions of Sublocade, particularly in comparison to traditional OAT medications such as Suboxone, including barriers, facilitators, and any health, social, and community reintegration impacts. The current project aims to interview 80 provincially-incarcerated individuals in Ontario receiving either Sublocade (40 individuals) or Suboxone (40 individuals), both during and post-incarceration, to examine these outcomes. Equal numbers of men and women will be recruited and interviews will be analyzed to identify and compare/contrast common themes and experiences, including any sex/gender differences. The research will be conducted in collaboration with the Ontario Ministry of the Solicitor General and will take approximately 3 years. The information from this project will have important clinical, public health, and policy implications as improved treatment can result in reduced risks for overdose, and enhanced social, health, and community reintegration outcomes. Results will be widely shared with stakeholders through webinars, conferences, and social networks, as well as published in academic journals and used to fulfill my PhD dissertation requirements."

The current research used social capital theory - community trust and involvement - to study and evaluate age-friendly communities in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) that has been implemented by the Government of NL. A mixed methods approach to data collection included a) surveys of 23 communities, including surveys completed by 45 individual age-friendly committee members, b) census and health data, and c) qualitative focus groups or interviews with 35 committee members in 11 communities, and with 43 seniors in 4 communities. In total, 108 people and 24 communities participated in this research. Communities were small in population and were located in rural areas of NL. Communities who had higher income levels had lower social capital, and those experiencing outmigration rated low on sense of community, suggesting a complex interplay between community population variables and social capital. Qualitative findings indicated benefits for communities related to intergenerational programming, and for seniors, related to health, social support, and technological education. Outmigration both increased the need for programming given aging populations, and created a challenge for program development given volunteer burnout, typically addressed by community capacity building and maximizing social capital resources. Those communities who experienced lower levels of social capital typically had more problems developing this capacity. Overall, social capital moderated the success of community-based initiatives in rural or small-town Newfoundland and Labrador. This research demonstrated significant benefits for seniors' health - their overall well being, social support, and physical activity, and made recommendations to the provincial government to enhance the program and to expand upon identified health benefits for seniors."

Research has consistently shown that ageism carries with it serious psychological, social, and health ramifications for older people and can result in inequitable treatment in healthcare. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted and exacerbated the pervasive and serious implications of ageism on older peoples' basic human rights. However, Indigenous perspectives on aging, that value older adults/Elders and their contributions, offer a positive view on aging that fundamentally oppose the typically Western stereotypes, prejudices, and discriminations held against older adults. Further, Dr. Russell's research has shown that intergenerational connectivity can undermine the devastating health implications of ageism. This TCAS-led Café Scientifique will include three keynote speakers (an Indigenous Elder, an Indigenous Aging Researcher, and an Ageism Researcher) and a panel of two additional people (a Community Leader who works with older people, and a Trent Graduate Student studying ageism) to share research on understanding and reducing systemic ageism. Specifically, the event will disseminate research findings on Health and Ageism, Indigenous Perspectives on Ageism, and Intergenerational Perspectives on Ageism. Held in the Peterborough Public Library (A Gord Downie & Chanie Wenjack Fund Legacy Space), this accessible event will consider equity, diversity, and inclusion in many ways, especially by taking specific efforts to include older people in the planning, and to invite and hear from older community members from underserved groups at the event."

The long-term effects of concussion on mental health, criminality and social functioning are largely unknown. 

We will use Manitoba population-based data to find youth aged 10-18 years who have had a concussion and those who did not. We will follow them for at least 10 years and measure their mental health (depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, psychosis, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, substance abuse disorder, and suicide attempts), were involved with Child and Family Services, received income assistance, or were charged with a crime or a victim of a crime. We will also look for characteristics (for example, age, sex, repeat concussions, or family history of mental health diagnoses) that may increase the risk of having these outcomes. We will use data from Manitoba Health, Manitoba Administrative Health Database, Manitoba Justice, and Vital Statistics.

The results will provide population-based evidence about the relationship between having a concussion as a youth and future development of psychiatric disorders, criminal behavior, and needs for social assistance. Results will inform physicians and social workers about who is at risk after a concussion and thus better initiate referrals, treatment, and assistance by appropriate specialists."

Our goal is to describe the relationship between physical, mental, educational, and social outcomes in childhood and young adulthood among children whose mothers are exposed to IPV compared to their peers who have not been exposed to IPV.  We will also identify factors that may protect these children from experiencing worse outcomes.  
 
We will use existing data at the Manitoba Center for Health Policy to identify women who pressed charges for IPV before their child turned 18 years old. We will compare outcomes of their children to children of mothers who do not press charges for IPV.  Child outcomes will be measured for up to 20 years after IPV charges.  We will examine the child's risk of having a future mental or physical health disorders and determine how IPV exposure impacts children's school performance.  We will assess factors that may protect children from the harmful effects of IPV exposure, such as their mother not being diagnosed with a mental disorder or only pressing charges for IPV once.

Giving voice to the lived experiences of PEI's abortion access policies,"['Rutledge, Emily A']",['N/A'],"['Feminist', 'Health Care Policy', 'Liberation Psychology', 'Participatory Action Research', 'Qualitative', 'Reproductive Health']",17500.0,225120,"In Canada, access to abortion is guaranteed under the Canada Health Act. Despite this guarantee, access to abortion is compromised for many women. In PEI, the only province without abortion services, a number of policies limit women's ability to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. Provincial healthcare only covers abortion procedures performed before 14 weeks gestation and after women have had an ultrasound, with wait times often exceeding 15 weeks. These criteria may explain why over 60% of Islanders have paid out of pocket for a basic health care covered procedure in the past eight years (CBC News, 2010). Further compromising women's access is the cost of travel to the mainland and a lack of anonymity. Abortion services, previously available to women on the island, were discontinued when PEI's Protestant and Catholic Hospitals merged in 1982. Qualitative research is most effective when aiming to achieve rich understandings of lived experiences, while the first-voice experiences of those affected by existing policy provide insights to guide policy change. A qualitative study that systematically explores five women's first-hand experiences of the effects of PEI's policies surrounding abortion access will provide a better understanding of this issue, with potential to inform policy aimed at facilitating access to healthcare services.

The association of functional and structural social support with cognitive change in middle-aged and older adults: Results from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging,"['Rutter, Emily C']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Cognitive Function', 'Social Support']",977.0,476392,"While the COVID-19 outbreak has drawn attention to the importance of social support, and the consequences of social isolation, little is known about the long-term impacts of social resources on health. This is particularly true for cognition. Cognitive function refers to a collection of mental processes such as memory and executive function that allow an individual to complete both simple and complex tasks like planning and problem solving. Previous studies examining the role of social resources on cognition have largely depended on objective social support (e.g., marital status) rather than subjective measures (e.g., whether an individual believes they have someone to help with chores if they need it), which may more accurately assess available support. This, as well as incomplete, inconsistent and overlapping definitions of the various components that make up social support, mean the impact of subjective and objective social support on cognitive health is not well understood. This study will elucidate these relationships by investigating: 1) how subjective and objective social support are associated with cognition at baseline and over time, and 2) whether subjective support explains the relationship between objective measures of social support and cognitive health. Analyses will use data from over 30,000 participants in the Comprehensive cohort of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, an ongoing study of community-dwelling adults aged 45-85 at recruitment. Given the role that cognition plays in daily functioning and adaptation to change, cognitive decline is a major concern for many adults. A better understanding of the role that social support plays in preserving cognition is vital for the creation of effective policies and interventions aimed at minimizing age-related cognitive decline through reducing social isolation in mid- to late-life."
Precursors to and outcomes of mental and physical health problems: A 20-year longitudinal study.,"['Ruttle, Paula']",['N/A'],"['Adolescence', 'Aggression', 'Alcohol Abuse', 'Cortisol', 'Depression', 'Hierarchical Linear Modeling', 'Longitudinal', 'Obesity', 'Physical Health', 'Psychobiological']",10000.0,237006,"Mental and physical health problems are global phenomena that affect billions of people world-wide and place huge tolls on an individual's productivity and livelihood and cost the government billions of dollars annually in treatment and service fees.  Furthermore, these problems tend to co-occur, placing an even greater strain on at-risk individuals. Biological, psychological and social factors have been associated with both mental and physical health problems however these associations are typically examined concurrently.  The Wisconsin Study of Families and Work is a longitudinal study that has followed more than 400 individuals and their families for over 20 years. Extensive data has been collected during 15 waves of data collection from the prenatal period to age 18 years, typically at 1-2 year intervals. Various predictors measured at nearly every wave (e.g. income, parental depression, marital conflict, child temperament, parenting practices, etc.) will be used to simultaneously predict mental and physical health outcomes. Additionally, the role of stress physiology will be thoroughly examined in this model. Cortisol is a main by-product of the stress response and was measured at 4 time points between childhood and adolescence. Both diurnal and reactive measures of cortisol will be included in models to examine how altered stress physiology may act as a risk factor for the development of mental and physical health problems. Furthermore, advanced modeling techniques will be used to examine the co-occurrence of mental and physical health problems over time and to predict the likelihood of future health problems based on current health problems. In order to properly explore the progression of mental and physical health disorders, models that integrate psychological, social, and biological precursors at multiple points in time from infancy to late adolescence are needed in order to provide a comprehensive view of this complex process."

We will pay special attention to social isolation. Southwestern Ontario has a population of approximately 1.6 million people and almost 50,000 COVID-19 cases. This part of the province represents the diversity of Ontario, in its people, environment, economy and health. We will conduct three studies to address the objectives of the CIHR Operating Grant call: ""Addressing the Wider Health Impact of COVID-19"". Study 1 will use questionnaires, interviews, and electronic medical records to describe the impacts of the pandemic including social isolation. Study 2 will use questionnaire data and electronic medical record data from people in southwestern Ontario to identify how the pandemic has affected different groups of people, especially those at higher risk because of their social and economic situations. In Study 3, we will use what we learned in Studies 1 and 2 to design a way of delivering family physician care called the COVID-19 Patient-Provider Exchange in Primary Care (COPE_PC) to help patients and their family physicians talk about the risk of social isolation on their health."
