Long-term mental health outcomes of childhood hunger,"['Mcintyre, Lynn']","['Patten, Scott B']","['Children', 'Hunger', 'Longitudinal', 'Mental Health', 'Outcomes']",96182.0,229840,"Childhood hunger is an extreme manifestion of household food insecurity in Canada.  Since 1994 the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY) has followed a group of children who have experienced hunger and these children are now entering young adulthood.  In a previous analysis of this survey, we found that childhood hunger experience has long-term health effects and that girls seem to be more adversely affected than boys. This study will examine the long-term mental health outcomes of child hunger as well as the impact of hunger on educational attainment, work-related outcomes, and social relationships such as marriage and parenthood. We will determine if, and in what ways, the child hunger experience is particularly toxic for these outcomes independent of, and as part of a spectrum of child adversity.  If child hunger is damaging to mental health and associated outcomes of Canadian children then the call to detect such children and remedy their circumstances will be ever more convincing."
Facilitating knowledge translation and exchange within school health systems,"['McIsaac, Jessie-Lee D']",['N/A'],"['Chronic Disease Prevention', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Population Health Interventions', 'School Health Promotion', 'Systems-Level Action']",135000.0,302393,"Schools are an essential setting to promote healthy behaviours and many jurisdictions have adopted policies to guide school health. Knowledge translation (KT) is an essential component of health research. KT strategies can provide insight on changes needed to enhance policy decisions and practice change through encouraging collaboration between researchers and decision makers. Many KT activities related to school health are underway in Canada but there are a number of barriers that prevent the uptake of evidence including the competing cultures and priorities across policy and research settings. The Province of Nova Scotia (NS) offers a timely and useful case study for investigating and augmenting KT related to school health. I will capitalize on a partnership with the NS Departments of Education and Health and Wellness and work across research and policy settings to respond to KT research objectives. First, I will assess system-level barriers to KT and identify opportunities to enhance collaboration by engaging in policy discussions and gather knowledge from policy makers on school system issues. Second, I will contextualize evidence into KT tools to inform policy decisions and practice change by identifying emergent priorities of the school system that align with existing research evidence. This knowledge will be used to inform the development of accessible publications and contextualize existing evidence into KT tools. Finally, I will evaluate the impact of KT tools on policy and practice to understand factors influencing knowledge use using various policy and practice change indicators. My KT fellowship will inform subsequent research projects and help to bridge the worlds of research, policy and practice and advance school strategies to promote healthy behaviours."
Disseminating and contextualizing the results of the provincial assessment of healthy eating and active living policies and programs in Nova Scotia,"['McIsaac, Jessie-Lee D', 'Kirk, Sara F']","['McIsaac, Michael F', 'Blanchard, Christopher M', 'Kolen, Angela M', 'Poirier, Michelle', 'Rossiter, Melissa D', 'Storey, Kate E', 'Veugelers, Paul J', 'Williams, Patricia L']","['Childhood Obesity', 'Healthy Eating And Active Living Strategies', 'Policy Evaluation', 'Population Health', 'Primary Prevention', 'School Health']",17850.0,245658,"Childhood obesity is a major public health concern in Canada and schools are acknowledged as an essential point of intervention to support obesity prevention. In 2003, the Children's Lifestyle and School Performance Study (CLASS) demonstrated the extent of issue in Nova Scotia by identifying that 32.9% of Grade 5 children were overweight and 9.9% were obese. Over the past eight years, the provincial government has invested resources in policies and programs to support healthier behaviours among Nova Scotia children. In 2009, CLASS II set out to explore the impact of changes at four different levels: (1) Provincial Government; (2) School Boards; (3) practices across schools; and (4) characteristics of children and families. Over the past two years, we have conducted an inventory of policies and programs and successfully completed data collection in schools across the province. Over the next two years, we will focus on qualitative research, as well as disseminating and contextualizing the results.
To inform policy, practice and further academic inquiry, we will share the preliminary research findings in conjunction with two conferences in Halifax, Nova Scotia. The first event will target key Nova Scotia stakeholders, including representatives from our Provincial Government, school boards, district health authorities, schools and communities. The purpose of the first meeting is to focus on knowledge dissemination through key research findings relevant to policy and practice. The second event will include stakeholders representing research, policy or practice outside of Nova Scotia. The purpose of the second meeting will be to contextualize the research findings within the larger body of knowledge on the topic of school-based obesity prevention, thereby focusing on knowledge synthesis. Collectively, the dissemination events will provide an opportunity to disseminate and synthesize the implications of the research with knowledge users in research, policy and practice."

Early childhood programs often follow healthy eating guidelines that encourage responsive feeding principles but there are barriers that prevent this from happening. Past interventions that support healthy eating do not typically think about behaviour change across multiple levels. Our study aims to use theory in the development, implementation and evaluation of an intervention to create responsive feeding environments in the early years in the Maritimes. We will use a pre-post intervention design to evaluate an intervention for responsive feeding in selected early childhood programs. Through partnership with our collaborators, we will identify ways that our intervention can inform integration and scaling-up within current early years systems to create more responsive feeding environments for young children."
Transitions to a new normal: The health of young children in the Maritimes during COVID-19,"['McIsaac, Jessie-Lee D', 'Turner, Joan C']","['Janus, Magdalena', 'Rossiter, Melissa D']","['Child Health', 'Early Childhood Development', 'Family Support', 'Mental Health', 'Nutrition', 'Physical Activity', 'Prevention']",80000.0,430237,"The efforts of parents/caregivers are essential to control the spread of COVID-19 and to ensure supportive environments for young children's health. The states of emergency established in the Maritime provinces from COVID-19 have led to closures to many services for families with young children, the enforcement of physical distancing principles and abrupt changes to employment conditions and income; therefore, shifting the balance of responsibility on families. The level of risk associated with disruption to family life impacting children's health and development is unknown as families manage unpredictable challenges while following government and health directives. This research aims to understand how Maritime families with young children (0 to 8 years), are being impacted and manage family life during the COVID-19 global pandemic. 

Baseline data on family adjustment already collected provides a foundation for this proposed study that will explore adaptation to family life as the conditions of COVID-19 change to reflect unique timelines of the spread and management of the disease across three provinces. Followed by an initial survey of more than 2200 respondents, the second phase will include a repeat survey and opportunity for families to participate in telephone interviews designed to better understand the adjustments and adaptations to family life over time. The need to study family life during this changing time is critical to provide well-timed, relevant information on the resources needed to support early childhood development and health and mitigate the potential impacts now and into the future. Policy interventions targeting the needs of young families are necessary to ensure success of public health measures to prevent and manage COVID-19. Ongoing engagement with decision makers will advance the dissemination of the results and development of resources and supports for families with young children."

Many parents with young children access and prefer online support and resources, especially through social media.  However, there is a lack of evidence-based resources focused on early social and emotional health that are inclusive to diverse families, especially in the Canadian context. Through a planning and dissemination grant, we will co-design a social media strategy with a diverse family advisory committee with representatives from across Atlantic Canada to reflect experiences, across location, gender and parenting roles/structures, cultural/ethnic/language backgrounds, and accessibility considerations. The co-designed social media strategy will increase access to evidence-based information that meets the identified needs of diverse families related to early social and emotional health. We also seek to identify future research questions and priorities for families to support early social and emotional health. After multiple informative and collaborative meetings with the family advisory committee, we will bring families, policymakers, and practitioners together for a virtual symposium to discuss future priorities and possibilities to help build families' capacity to support their children's social and emotional health and long-term well-being."

Responsive feeding helps to encourage self-regulation in children by allowing children to communicate feelings of hunger and is followed by an appropriate response from the caregiver. Early learning and children care (ELCC) programs often follow healthy eating guidelines that encourage responsive feeding principles but there are barriers that prevent this from happening. CELEBRATE Feeding (Coaching in Early Learning Environments to Build a Responsive Approach to Eating and Feeding) is a CIHR-funded project using behaviour change theory to strengthen the feeding environment in child care environments. Dietitians are coaching educators at 8 child care centres in the Maritime provinces using behaviour change theory to inform intervention strategies. Early indicators suggest that this support is beneficial, but the specific intervention components that are feasible and important for scale-up need to be explored. 

Collaborators from research, early childhood, and public health, along with representatives from each participating ELCC program will be invited to join a one-day scale-up event hosted simultaneously in Charlottetown and Halifax. ELCC program representatives will be asked to submit pedagogical documentation material that represents their project's successes for the event. Following introductions and context-setting, ELCC program representatives will share their stories highlighting their key accomplishments while other participants will listen with intention. Smaller groups will be formed based on considerations for scale-up, reflecting on commonalities and unique aspects of the ELCC programs. These reflections will then be shared with the whole group through an afternoon session focused on identifying critical next steps to scale-up responsive feeding practices in ELCC programs."

We broadly refer to mobility, as the physical capacity of individuals to move themselves. Mobility is key to one's health and it is embedded into the activities we perform every day. Limited mobility is a significant risk factor for further physical disability, brain health impairments, and is associated with an increased risk of early death. Therefore, maintaining mobility is fundamental to healthy aging and to retaining one's independence for as long as possible. This is particularly true for men who are at high risk for diseases often born of inactivity (i.e., cardiovascular disease, diabetes).  ""Shape the Path: Targeting the health and mobility of older men through key community partnerships"" is a program of research that aims to answer three questions related to men's mobility:  What supports or stands in the way of men's mobility in three distinct settings (community, home, residential care)? What factors influence men's mobility and health across these settings? What factors influence government and municipal decision makers to implement best practices related to men's mobility and health? Our research team from across disciplines and community partners from across sectors are committed to use novel approaches to answer these questions. We will also call upon our vast network of partners to move our research findings into action to make a difference to the health of men in Canada and beyond."

A crucial element of mobility in aging is community design the built environment. The Institute of Aging's strategic focus on Mobility in Aging specifically mentions 'community design' and underscores the potential for it to 'profoundly influence the psychological, social and physical health of older adults'. 

Despite its importance, there has been little Canadian health research connecting the built environment and Mobility in Aging.  Our Emerging Team will deliver various research products including systematic and realist reviews, reports customized to stakeholders, policy rounds, manuscripts and joint grant applications. To do this we will engage diverse stakeholders.  

We will address our goals via 3 Research Themes and 8 'Key Activities'. The research themes relate to the disciplines that address (1) The Built Environment, (2) Mobility in Aging, and (3) Economic Cost and Quality of Life. 

Providing unifying activities across these Themes are 8 Key Activities. As a team, we will: (i) review the formal and informal evidence base for the field, (ii) engage appropriate stakeholders and their representatives at all levels from federal government to the community, (iii) refine research methods to advance the field as well as applied methods that can be used in the applied setting, (iv) intervene to improve mobility in by influencing individuals and policy makers, (v) partner nationally (engagement, above) and internationally to harness the wisdom of the world and to facilitate future dissemination of our research, (vi) embrace knowledge translation and exchange principles from the outset of the study, (vii) apply and advance the 'science of team science' to ensure that investigators become a high-functioning team and (viii) mentor trainees and junior faculty so that they can maximize their potential and contribute substantially to improving seniors' heal"

We define mobility as the physical capacity of humans to walk or move themselves within their communities.  Limited mobility predicts death in older adults and is a consistent risk factor for disability, social exclusion and poor quality of life. There is an increasing body of evidence linking the Built Environment (BE) (individual elements of how towns and cities are designed and the services and amenities they provide) with specific health problems in adults, but very few studies address these questions in seniors. Therefore, we propose research that evaluates how the BE is associated with mobility, social exclusion and quality of life in older adults. We have engaged key stakeholders  and continue to partner in an alliance to execute our research and implement and disseminate discoveries, tools and products. This proposal consists of 3 Research Themes. In Theme A, we gather and synthesize the existing knowledge related to our area of focus. In Theme B, we refine and create new tools to evaluate the 'walkability' (pedestrian-friendliness) and 'accessibility' (access to service and amenities) of different neighbourhoods in which older adults live. In Theme C, we evaluate the influence of the built environment on older adults' mobility and quality of life. In addition to these Research Themes, we have a 'key cross-cutting element' relating to knowledge translation and exchange. This refers to generating built environment research outcomes that have impact through creating new products, influencing policy, and effectively promoting mobility in aging."
Shape the Path: Targeting the Health and Mobility of Older Men through Key Community Partnerships,"['Mckay, Heather A', 'Herman, Matthew S', 'Sims-Gould, Joanie']","['Hoppmann, Christiane A', 'Lang, Ariella', 'Mackey, Dawn C', 'Miran-Khan, Karim', 'Phinney, Alison', 'Robinovitch, Stephen N', 'Winters, Meghan']","['Active Travel', 'Built And Social Environment', 'Home Care', 'Implementation', 'Knowledge Translation And Exchange', 'Masculinity', 'Mobility', 'Older Men', 'Physical Activity', 'Residential Care']",726709.0,317955,"Our project title 'Shape the Path' refers to efforts to pave the way for older men to maintain mobility in a range of ways (personal, social, health settings, physical environment).  Shape the Path aims to lessen the substantial burden of mobility-disability in older men. To do so we will examine factors (e.g. ethnicity, gender, environment, socioeconomic status) that influence older men's ability to 'go where they want to go, when they want to go there, and how they want to get there'. If one considers mobility as a 'capacity' then it facilitates older men's independence and their quality of life. We will assess capacity in a number of ways based on what men can actually do ( 'enacted capacity') and what they think they can do ('perceived capacity') across 3 distinct settings: community, home care and residential care. These settings represent different levels of mobility. 

We will use a variety of research methods to develop an in-depth understanding of men's experiences and other factors related to participation in physical activity as this is closely linked with their mobility. We will combine those new understandings with existing knowledge to intervene with a novel program that promotes (i) physical activity in community-dwelling older men. Next, we will determine the mobility characteristics of older men who receive home care support and intervene with a model that aims to enhance men's capacity (called re(ablement)) in home care. Finally, we will identify the mobility limitations of frail older men in residential care using novel sensor and video technology. This will be the basis for new strategies for promoting safe mobility for men in residential care. 

Importantly, we work closely with committed community stakeholders who guide the questions we ask. Together we deliver our findings back out to those who might benefit the most from what we learned, through dissemination of relevant programs, practices and policies."

However, given the challenges of scale-up, many interventions that improved the health of individuals are never rolled out on a broader scale.

Physical activity programs are among prevention strategies with many proven health benefits for older adults. Despite this, most older adults in Canada are not active enough to sustain their health. Therefore - we recognize a need to find effective ways to adapt and move physical activity programs that worked in smaller studies into more communities to benefit those who need them most. However, although we know what programs were effective, we still don't know how best to effectively deliver them across regions, provinces or the whole country.

Ultimately, our global goal is to enhance the mobility, health and independence of older adults in Canada. Therefore, for our meeting/planning grant our aim is to overcome the challenges of implementing effective health programs at large scale. To do so we will bring together thought leaders and scientists from around the world whose expertise is implementation at scale. Our proposal has three parts. First, we will review the world literature to see what has or has not worked when scaling up physical activity programs (focus on older adults) and the tools used to evaluate scale-up. Second, our international think tank' experts will present real world scale-up case studies that speak to the process of scale up and measurement of it to further inform what we learn from our review. Third, we will summarize our findings from the review and the 'think tank' in a document that identifies areas for further study and make recommendations for health prevention researchers whose aim is to implement and evaluate effective programs at scale."

Thus, healthy aging is a public health priority. Many older adult health promoting interventions have been implemented, yet few were scaled-up and none were sustained. CTM is an effective, adaptable health promotion program for older adults. CTM improved healthy aging indicators-mobility, social connectedness, and decreased loneliness of older adults. We are now scaling-up Choose to Move (CTM) across British Columbia (BC) with support from BC Ministry of Health. Community partners and older adults identified three elements essential to CTM success: program flexibility, social interactions, and trusted relationships between participants and activity coaches (who deliver CTM).

In this CTM sustainability (CTM-S) study we aim to determine if health benefits of CTM can be maintained. Therefore, we integrated the three essential elements into design of CTM-S and will assess three follow-up approaches: 1. activity coaches hold annual group meetings and call participants quarterly; 2. government service staff (HealthLinkBC) call participants quarterly; 3. we create a Facebook group for CTM-S participants and prompt participants daily. In a fourth group we will not actively follow-up. We will allocate 166 CTM programs (1743 participants) to follow-up arms. In our evaluation we will: 1) assess if during follow-up older adults' mobility, social connectedness/loneliness, physical activity and sedentary time across 12 and 24 months are maintained; 2) measure costs associated with each follow-up arm, program affordability and value to policy makers; 3) identify factors that support or inhibit implementation of CTM-S. Our team has expertise in older adult health promotion and implementation science research, trainee mentorship, economic evaluation and knowledge translation. We endeavour to generate strategies that can be used to implement and sustain effective health promotion strategies for older adults across Canada."

Despite this, only 11% of Canadian older adults are active enough to enjoy health benefits. To positively affect the health of populations, physical activity programs that demonstrate effectiveness on a small scale must be scaled-up and sustained. In our recent (unpublished) systematic review of older adult physical activity interventions, of 1364 studies less than 1% were scaled up and only 8% assessed implementation. Of these, only four studies assessed implementation at scale-up. Scale-up is often relegated to the 'too hard' basket, which may reflect the many partnerships that must be in place for scale-up to succeed, and the substantial cost. Therefore, we aim to identify strategies that can be used to adapt, implement and evaluate scale-up of effective health promotion interventions.

Our global goal is to enhance the mobility, health, and independence of older adults through enhanced physical activity. Thus, we propose to invite national and international experts in scale-up science and healthy aging, as well as key knowledge users, to Vancouver, BC. Our objectives for the meeting are threefold. First, we will develop an action plan to acknowledge and fill gaps in implementation and scale-up science research in healthy aging. Second, we will focus our action plan toward developing a CIHR Implementation Science Team Grant in Healthy Aging. Third, we will lay the groundwork for an opinion piece for the new Implementation Science Communications journal to highlight; i) the state of implementation and scale-up science in healthy aging (guided by our systematic review); ii) issues in implementation and scale-up science (e.g. inconsistent language, lack of standardized tools and measures); and iii) suggested ways forward. What we learn in BC can be applied to scale-up of physical activity interventions across Canada and the world."

However, 85% of older adults in Canada are not active enough to enjoy health benefits. Therefore, with our community partners we co-designed Choose to Move (CTM)-a flexible, community-based program that improved physical activity, mobility, social connectedness and diminished loneliness in older adult participants. CTM was scaled-up across 8 years to reach >6000 older adults in British Columbia (BC). However, our reach was primarily in Metro Vancouver. As northern cities face different challenges implementing health-promoting initiatives (e.g., dispersed geography, climate, isolation from metropolitan centres, transportation), 'what works' in southern urban centres may not translate to northern communities. To address this inequity, we aim to build capacity in the community-based seniors' services sector to enable them to adapt and deliver health-promoting programs (CTM) in northern BC.

Our objectives for this planning grant are to:
1. develop a specific plan of action to identify/fill gaps in capacity that would enable the community-based seniors' services sector to effectively implement health-promoting interventions for older adults living in northern communities;
2. develop a CIHR Project Grant in Healthy Aging that evaluates implementation and health benefits of CTM, adapted for older adults in northern BC.

To achieve these objectives, we propose to bring together researchers who work in healthy aging (in northern communities), physical activity and implementation science, sex and gender science, and key knowledge users representing community-based seniors' services organizations who engage with a diverse range of older adults living in northern communities, to Prince George, BC for a planning meeting. What we learn can be applied to adapting health-promoting interventions for northern BC, and other more remote geographies across Canada."

From small beginnings, CTM was scaled-up across 7 years to reach >6000 older adults in one province. However, CTM engaged primarily white older adults, most of whom were women. Our Implementation Science Team in Healthy Aging aims to address this inequity. We propose to adapt CTM for three more diverse groups of older adults who live in large- (Vancouver, Surrey) or medium-sized (Prince George, Waterloo) cities. Specifically, we will focus on older adults marginalized by one or more of: ethnicity, geography, sex/gender. We will work with community-based seniors' services (e.g., not-for-profits; cultural centers; neighbourhood houses) to adapt CTM for 'best fit' and to help organizations build the capacity (support and training) they need to deliver the CTM program. 

Our research objectives are to: 
1) describe how CTM is adapted to meet the needs of older adults of different ethnicities, older adults in northern BC and older men; (an engagement/adaptation outcome); 
2) evaluate factors that affect implementation (e.g., feasibility) (an implementation science outcome); and 
3) measure health indicators among older adults who participate in CTM (a health outcome). 

Our impact will be an implementation science research network, engaged community organizations, an evidence-based and more equitable intervention (CTM), a new generation of implementation scientists, and healthy, engaged and connected older adults."

Our objectives are two pronged. Our team will develop Elders' capacity through education on the social and clinical aspects of HIV/AIDS, including the need for early testing and adherence to treatment; Secondly, once Elders are familiar with the issues, they will share advice about feelings of loss, fear, stigma and addiction. 

The last decade has seen a dramatic increase in research finding the benefit and need for the inclusion of TCK into Aboriginal intervention programs. But, What is TCK, and does it have the capacity to discuss contemporary issues of sex, intravenous drugs and HIV/AIDS? 

Our research has found that Elders' advice is rich with suggested applications of TCK for intervention programming. It is also rich with specific coping mechanisms for stigma, fear and despair; optimistic perspectives on an individual's responsibility to the self and community, prayers and personal stories of overcoming addiction and trauma. Very often, the advice comes in the Hul'q'umi'num', Coast Salish language. These quotes will be translated to English, and included in a booklet with accompanying CD. These will be a useful tools for future intervention program development, such as would bring youth together with Elders. The audio and textual materials can be used to expand the capacity of a further pool of Elders. As critical as these materials will be to future intervention programmers, much will also be learned from the process of KT from Western clinical paradigms into traditional ones.  Subsequent translation of traditional advice into relevant information for the research community will be published in journals for this purpose."

This project seeks to determine: 1) What constrains and fosters Aboriginal women living in poverty's reproductive justice? 2) What changes to social and health services would increase Aboriginal women's access to reproductive justice? 3) What structural and cultural shifts would increase Aboriginal women's access to reproductive justice? In order to examine these questions, this project will collaborate with Aboriginal women living in poverty and service providers who work closely with them as co-researchers. This project will engage ethnographic approaches including qualitative interviews, photography, and field notes. This data will be supplemented by an analysis of the federal and provincial policies relating to reproductive justice. Together, the research team (the Principal Applicant and co-researchers) will determine how to disseminate the study's results and recommendations."

In an effort to assist this goal, early intervention services have been set up across Ontario. However, studies of these services suggest that there is a greater delay between developing symptoms of psychosis and getting treatment for people of African and Caribbean origin than European Canadians. These delays may lead to more severe illness with worse outcomes and more involvement of emergency services and the criminal justice system.

The ACE Pathways to Care project documented and compared the pathways taken to early intervention services for African, Caribbean and European origin Canadians living in Toronto and Hamilton. Furthermore, it looked at the different routes these ethnic groups took to getting care and why they took particular routes over others. The study results are now ready to be shared with healthcare providers, community agencies and policy makers in order to promote early treatment and better outcomes. 

By bringing together different stakeholders, this project will provide an opportunity for communities, clinicians and policy makers to learn about the key findings of the ACE Pathways to Care study and to engage in the subject in a public setting. To ensure the maximum impact of the study findings, knowledge will shared using two activities: A. Digital-Storytelling Workshops, where 3 minute digital movies will be created by study participants (e.g., clients and their family) as well as staff working in early intervention services. These digital stories will be used as a discussion tool during the forum, and; B. Knowledge Users Exchange Forum, a two-day meeting with the different stakeholders, which will form the basis of targeted interventions to increase health equity in Toronto and Ontario."

Evidence shows significant differences in the mental health of immigrant, refugee, ethnocultural and racialised (IRER) groups when compared to other people in Canada. The general path is for worsening mental health and higher rates of mental illness, suicide and substance misuse the longer groups have been in Canada. IRER groups do not receive an equitable response to their needs from health systems.  Health promotion and illness prevention initiatives may not be as effective in these groups.   
The Mental Health Commission of Canada has published a vision for a transformed mental health system.  A major focus is the move towards prevention and health promotion and away from simply producing more mental health services.  This offers an opportunity to decrease the rates of mental illness in IRER groups and bring them down to that of others in Canada.  But for this to happen we need better information on what prevention and health promotion strategies are effective in IRER groups  
We propose a program of research into the prevention of mental illness and the promotion of mental health in IRER groups in Canada. We plan to build the evidence on risk and protective factors for mental health problems and illnesses in IRER groups in Canada as well as identifying which prevention and health promotion strategies are effective. We will develop a method for adapting mainstream initiatives to meet the needs of IRER groups and investigate how to facilitate such initiatives being taken up by policy makers and communities. 
At present no single centre in Canada contains the expertise for this ambitious undertaking. We will develop a virtual centre including leading academic departments, policy makers and community workers across Canada. We will ensure that the perspective of both communities and policy makers instruct what happens in the research so that our findings are more likely to be used."

In this country, Indigenous people are more likely to test positive, be hospitalized and die from Covid than other Canadians. They are also more likely to be vaccine hesitant, reflecting longstanding harms by and suspicions of medical science and the government.

This proposed work builds on the activities of our Indigenous-led Kitatipithitamak Mithwayawin project as we work with Indigenous communities across Canada as they respond to Covid. Over the last year, we have built a social network of >2,300 followers on our project Facebook page. This network reflects the impacts of our ongoing communications and outreach (total >150,000 views) and the recent release of our digital App (Indigenous COVID-19). 

The App will be used by Indigenous communities across the country to provide local, holistic and community-controlled health data in real-time. 
In this proposal, we will use the App to further our work in 15 Indigenous communities across Canada and complement these activities with additional surveys and interviews. This work is grounded in both public health and in local cultural traditions. It will focus on vaccine and vaccine hesitancy in communities. Importantly, it will also assess any impacts of new variants, better serve ""long-haulers"" that continue to suffer adverse impacts, and assess what effects any pre-existing health conditions have on recovery. The data will be owned and controlled by each community and will help support local health directors. They will also help inform our own Covid-related communications, which will in turn help build community confidence in and uptake of public health measures. In so doing we will support communities as they recover from Covid and navigate an uncertain post-Covid future together."

The World Health Organization recently declared COVID-19 as a global health emergency. Studies on H1N1 and other pandemics show that Indigenous communities in Canada suffered most from these diseases. Responses to H1N1 were often inadequate and at worst created more harm than good. Communities had poor access to medical experts and supplies. Indigenous organizations were mostly excluded from decision-making. And misinformation generated much fear that still persists today. Yet, many Indigenous communities and organizations also responded effectively and, with others, eventually found ways to reduce the impacts of H1N1. The outbreak of COVID-19 thus represents a critical moment. On one hand the same mistakes could be made, with similar impacts. On the other hand, there is an opportunity to do things differently in ways that are grounded in the priorities of Indigenous communities and organizations. The goal of this project is to evaluate the implications of past and existing responses to pandemics with respect to Indigenous communities across Canada and to address any gaps in understanding and support related to COVID-19 and future pandemics. This collaborative project will focus on the past by documenting experiences with other pandemics and explore changes in response over time. It will focus on the present by assessing current state of community emergency planning and risk communication. Finally, it will focus on the future by assessing community responses to different possible scenario and ideas for moving forward. We will share our outcomes with Indigenous communities and organizations across Canada, all levels of governments, and the general public so that the health interests of Indigenous people are best served now and into the future."
Children's Movement in an Integrated Kindergarten Classroom: What Can Their Bodies Do?,"['Mclaren, Coralee M']",['N/A'],"['Built Environments', 'Children', 'Ecological Psychology', 'Education', 'Movement', 'Neuroscience', 'Philosophy', 'Physical Disability', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Rehabilitation']",110000.0,206437,"Moving about and playing freely in indoor and outdoor environments is important for children's physical, psychological, and social well being. Research from the field of cognitive neuroscience indicates that movement also enhances children's ability to learn and communicate. Very little is known about how children use their bodies' capacities for movement and how they interact with physical features of their everyday environments. This knowledge gap is particularly problematic for children with physical disabilities because gross and fine motor impairments restrict their ability to move. Exclusionary attitudes, safety concerns and environmental barriers also limit their ability to explore their surroundings. The purpose of this study is to describe how disabled and non-disabled children move, gesture and interact naturally in an integrated kindergarten classroom. Children's bodies are conceptualized using a philosophical premise that any body's potential is unknown until it is allowed to demonstrate what it can do. The integrated classroom is conceptualized using a theory of affordances, which posits that people and their environments are interrelated. Child-and disability-friendly ethnographic methods are used to study the class of 20 children through structured observations and semi-structured interviews. The findings will be relevant because they will increase understandings about environmental features that enhance or inhibit children's movement capacities. This knowledge could also be used to optimize environments that support children's right to move freely within them, interventions to develop their social, cognitive and physical capacities, and educational and rehabilitation strategies that encourage children to explore, navigate and shape their everyday environments."

We will do so by comparing Calgary and Edmonton, which are the two largest cities in Alberta and are well-matched in terms of size and demographics. On May 18, 2011, drinking water fluoridation in Calgary was discontinued after having been in place since 1991. Meanwhile, municipal drinking water remains fluoridated in Edmonton. High-quality, pre-intervention data are available from population-based oral health surveys conducted by former health regions in Alberta during the 1990s and 2000s. 
Most research on drinking water fluoridation and oral health is from fluoridation initiation studies, and is now outdated. Research on fluoridation discontinuation (the currently more common circumstance) is limited. The discontinuation of fluoridation in Calgary presents a research opportunity that should not be missed. 
We seek funds to collect post-intervention data in 2013/14, to supplement funds already committed from Alberta Health and Wellness (AHW) for a study of more limited scope. Since approval of our original proposal by AHW in late March 2012, stakeholder input and policy needs have prompted two modifications to our methods, which means a larger sample size than funded by the Alberta government. The present funding opportunity is the only one that is viable, time-wise, to accommodate these adaptations.
This study has local, national, and methodological importance. We will: 1) create knowledge of the short-term impact of fluoridation discontinuation in Calgary during a time frame when the decision could still be reversed; 2) generate information for other Canadian municipalities that are currently revisiting their fluoridation status; and 3) establish a methodological foundation for future waves of data collection which will permit monitoring of trends over time and comparison with national data."

Recently, it has been suggested that the population strategy of prevention may inadvertently worsen socioeconomic inequities in health.

Oral health problems are common. People with oral health problems may have trouble eating, speaking, and interacting with others. Pain and infection from oral disease can cause physical discomfort. 

Many oral health problems are preventable. One option for prevention is appropriate exposure to fluoride, including via community water fluoridation. Fluoridation is the controlled addition of fluoride to a public drinking water supply to prevent tooth decay. When it comes to research on fluoridation and oral health, there are some important knowledge gaps. First, much of the evidence is out of date. In a recent systematic review, most of the studies were published before 1975, and there have been important changes since then. Second, almost all research focuses on children, with limited attention to other population groups. 

In Alberta, we have a unique opportunity to address these limitations. First, we will examine the association between community water fluoridation and children's tooth decay. We will take advantage of the research opportunity provided by Calgary's decision to stop fluoridation in 2011. In previous work, we studied children's dental caries in Calgary 2-3 years after fluoridation was stopped, and compared it to Edmonton where fluoridation continues. We will build on that earlier work by 1) conducting a longer-term follow up (7-8 years after fluoridation was stopped), and 2) conducting an economic analysis, to understand whether or not the benefits of fluoridation are greater than the costs. Second, we will expand our work to consider another population: seniors living in long term care facilities. Seniors in long term care facilities are vulnerable to poor oral health, but they have not been well studied. We have an established research team that includes experienced university researchers and dental public health decision-makers."

Epidemiological Correlates of HIV Phylogenetic Diversification Rate in British Columbia,"['McLaughlin, Angela M']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,399960,"Identifying HIV transmission risk factors can inform the prioritization of treatment and prevention services. The analysis of patients' HIV sequences can illuminate transmission activity beyond what is visible by traditional epidemiology methods alone. Although identifying clusters of similar HIV sequences is routinely performed to evaluate patient characteristics associated with high transmission activity, using cluster membership alone over-simplifies the range of transmission activity across a population. We introduce an alternative method to investigate HIV transmission risk factors in British Columbia (BC), Canada, based on patients' viral diversification rates. For 8,103 people living with HIV (PLHIV) in BC in March 2018, we recovered the oldest available HIV protease and RT sequences from the BC Drug Treatment Program database. We applied phylogenetics to infer the family history of viral sequences across the population of PLHIV, and then for each viral tip in the tree, we calculated its diversification rate as an estimate of its transmission rate. Patient attributes significantly associated with high viral transmission were evaluated using a generalized linear model. High HIV transmission activity was positively associated with being younger, using injection drugs, having hepatitis C virus, having a high recent viral load, and residing within the Northern BC Health authority.  In contrast, having ever had AIDS and identifying as black were both significantly associated with lower transmission activity. By identifying risk factors associated with HIV transmission using the viral diversification rate among PLHIV, we can confidently recommend prioritized provision of treatment and prevention services for key groups. Additionally, these analyses highlight that HIV diversification rates can illuminate differences in individuals' transmission activity, regardless of phylogenetic cluster membership."

Treatments result in significant negative side effects. Physical activity (PA) is safe, beneficial, and feasible for children with cancer to help mitigate these side effects, yet most remain inactive. The international Pediatric Oncology Exercise Guidelines (iPOEG) were created to provide guidelines and recommendations for movement in this population. iPOEG Toolkits, to support guideline implementation, are being co-created with end-user groups (children and adolescents affected by cancer, families/caregivers, healthcare providers, qualified exercise professionals, community-based organizations) for dissemination. Research Questions: 1) Track the dissemination and reach specifically of the iPOEG Toolkit resources across Canada; 2) Work with the iPOEG Core team (n=9 international experts from 6 countries) to develop and translate iPOEG Toolkit resources to their local setting; and 3) Assess the impact of implementation efforts, nationally and internationally, on user physical activity levels and patient-reported outcomes. Methods: The iPOEG Toolkit will be distributed to key stakeholders, and tracked using the RE-AIM framework. Reach is the number of individuals who receive and download the iPOEG Toolkit; adoption is the number of organizations who implement/use the Toolkit in care; implementation includes documenting modifications made to the iPOEG Toolkit based on local needs (e.g., language); and maintenance is tracking reach and effectiveness markers over time. Effectiveness includes impact on PA levels and patient-reported outcomes over time. Conclusion: This project will bring the iPOEG Toolkit resources to practice, nationally in Canada and internationally through the iPOEG network. Ultimately, the iPOEG Toolkit will be used to foster development of tailored exercise oncology programs, in-hospital and community-based, enhancing the well-being of children and adolescents with cancer."

In British Columbia, the restaurant and hospitality sectors have remained open throughout most of the pandemic with reduced hours, masking and restricted capacity. In August 2021, by order of the public health officer, patrons of licensed restaurants, pubs and other establishments were required to show proof of vaccination with a first dose by September 13 and a second by October 24. Businesses were required to check for vaccination status and deny services to those not meeting this requirement. 
Women, racialized persons and youth are overrepresented in the accommodation and food service sector and in lower paying positions and are at high risk of harassment and violence at work. Workers are often precariously employed and are at a power disadvantage with employers and customers. Growing evidence suggests that COVID-19 working conditions, including the requirement to enforce COVID-19 workplace safety protocols, puts these workers at a greater risk for harassment and violence as well consequent negative physical and mental health outcomes. 
This project is a mixed-method study that has three aims: First, it will conduct key informant interviews in the restaurant and hospitality sector to understand the experience of violence and harassment working under COVID-19 restrictions. Second, a survey of restaurant and hospitality workers from the Metro Vancouver and Central Okanagan regions who have experienced violence or harassment will be conducted to understand the broader contexts and the determinants and outcomes of their experience. Third, facilitated work will be conducted with community-based organizations, employer and worker associations, and WorkSafeBC to develop recommendations and guidelines to prevent and mitigate harassment and violence in the workplace due to public health measures."
Injection drug use is associated with food insecurity in HIV-hepatitis C virus co-infected individuals in Canada,"['McLinden, Taylor']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,342793,"BACKGROUND: In HIV-positive populations, food insecurity (FI), which refers to ""limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways"", is associated with poor HIV treatment adherence and adverse health outcomes. Among HIV-hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infected populations, injection drug use (IDU) may be a particularly important risk factor for FI. This study examines the relationship between recent IDU and FI among HIV-HCV co-infected individuals in Canada. METHODS: This analysis used data collected biannually from questionnaires (N=642 in 17 centres across 6 provinces, November 2012-March 2015). FI in the past 6 months was measured using a tool developed by Health Canada and categorized as: food secure; marginal, moderate, or severe FI. Recent IDU (in the past 6 months) was self-reported. Statistical models were used to estimate the effect of recent IDU on FI. RESULTS: Among 642 participants, 31% recently injected drugs and 64% (7% marginal, 23% moderate, 34% severe) experienced FI. Recent IDU was significantly associated with FI; the odds of experiencing FI were 39% higher in those who engaged in recent IDU, compared to those who did not recently inject drugs, after considering other factors such as: age, sex, province, Aboriginal status, housing, education, employment, income, previous IDU (beyond the past 6 months), other substance use (recent alcohol, cigarette, or marijuana use), other modes of recent drug use (snorting), recent anxiety or depression, and self-described health state. CONCLUSIONS: Recent IDU is a significant risk factor for FI. Given a high prevalence of IDU, substance abuse treatments and the integration of food supports in harm reduction programs (e.g., opioid substitution programs and supervised injection services) may mitigate FI and its impacts on health in this vulnerable sub-set of the HIV-positive population."
Examination of a Brief Enhanced Mobility Intervention for Older Adults with Limited Mobility,"['McMahon, Casey J']",['N/A'],"['Cognitive-Behavioural Interventions', 'Mobility In Older Adults']",850.0,346573,"We wish to determine if self-regulatory mobility cognitions (i.e., self-efficacy) and corresponding mobility can be improved by engaging older adults in a brief, mobility exercise plus counselling intervention that targets everyday mobility tasks. The study involves the comparison of two treatment arms: a treatment group (mobility task plus brief cognitive behavioural counselling: Mob-EX) with a mobility exercise plus education condition (Walk-ED). Each group will be pre and post-tested.  
The significance of a brief intervention focused on enhancing mobility and social cognitions in older adults is with respect to (a) persuading older adults who are not inclined to exercise to do a specific form of exercise that promotes their ability to remain independent in regard to being independently mobile and (b) intervention scalability. If both mobility and social cognitions were improved with only 2-weeks of participation it would have great implications for providing inactive older adults with similar programs as a step towards being more active. It may be a way for older adults to gain some confidence in their mobility abilities and be able to see the relevance of doing specific mobility exercise and its importance to their daily functioning."

Several emerging economies have, however, been able to actively participate in the field of RM, producing new knowledge and promising clinical trials. This study explores how China, Brazil and India have built up capacity in RM, and how regenerative medicine can be harnessed to address their local health needs.  Case studies are conducted using face to face in-depth semi-structured interviews as a primary data source. In each country, experts on stem cells, tissue engineering and gene therapy were interviewed from different sectors including research institutes, hospitals, firms, educational institutes, government, policy makers, and bioethicists. Interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis and triangulated with other results, including from bibliometric and patent trend analysis. The results of this research will include societal, cultural, regulatory and ethical issues that affect the development of RM in each country. The conclusions of this research can help inform policy that supports the generation of affordable solutions to local health needs and will help formulate overarching lessons for the development of high tech biomedical innovations in low resource settings. This research is of importance to a wide variety of stakeholders, including researchers and entrepreneurs interested in global biotechnology advances as well as for international policy and development groups."

Their use, however, is not without controversy. Some of the present controversy centres around claims that they are over-prescribed, in part for diagnoses other than depression. Further controversy evolves from claims that their effects are due to their capacity to engender beliefs on the part of patients that they are receiving an active treatment rather than to their direct influence on brain chemistry. Reports of these claims have received wide-spread coverage in both academic articles and the popular press. I propose to investigate how members of the following groups define and make sense of the evidence for the use and effectiveness of antidepressants and how they negotiate important issues raised by current controversies: (i) family physicians; (ii) patients who have received a prescription for an antidepressant for a diagnosis other than depression; and (iii) pharmacists. Questions that will be explored include how health professionals decide what to disclose to patients about the evidence for the use and effectiveness of antidepressants and how patients with diagnoses other than depression account for their physicians' decisions to prescribe and their own decisions to use antidepressants. This research will contribute to a better understanding of the complex interactions that transpire between patients and health care providers when evidence-based practice is challenged, and will inform evidence-based medicine and the quality of service delivery."

Currently, the housing crisis in Vancouver and elsewhere in the province is overlapping with the provincial overdose crisis. In response, novel harm reduction and addiction treatment interventions are now being implemented in housing environments. Building upon our extensive experience in examining social-structural influences on drug-related risks and harms, we are requesting funds to support a four-year program of community-based participatory research to address the following objectives: (1) To examine the implementation and impact of overdose-focused interventions within housing environments and their impacts on overdose-related outcomes; (2) To examine how intersecting social, structural, and environmental forces within housing environments shape overdose risk environments among people who use drugs; and (3) To explore the dynamics of peer and tenant involvement in the implementation and operation of overdose-focused interventions within housing environments"

Increasingly, health researchers have expressed concern regarding the risks associated with obese women's reproduction, and research is beginning to show that, as a result of these concerns, obese women are routinely denied fertility care. This denial is based in medical research that cites complications for both the woman and her (potential) fetus, including miscarriage, prematurity, and autism. At the same time that health risks have been emphasized by researchers, some scholars have instead focused on the stigma, or discrimination experienced by obese people, and have argued that obesity stigma, too, has negative health effects relating to the high stress levels associated with discrimination. Researchers have also found stigma within the healthcare setting, where preconceived notions about the obese on the part of healthcare workers can lead to misdiagnosis and the denial of care. What is missing from such research, however, is an analysis of obesity stigma within the fertility healthcare setting in particular. Obese women are considered ""risks"" to both themselves and to their children and, as a result, believed to be ""bad mothers""; how does this belief impact the healthcare of obese women attempting to conceive? This research answers this question by interviewing women and their experiences of receiving fertility care, healthcare workers about giving this care, and policy makers about setting guidelines about reproduction and obesity. The study will have 3 sites - Winnipeg, Toronto, and Montreal. In focusing nationally the research will contribute to ethical and effective care in Canada via provincial comparison and collaboration, and to suggest, through the education of health professionals, more ethical ways of approaching obesity in the healthcare encounter."
Setting the research agenda for addressing weight-related issues in children with physical disabilities: a consensus building workshop.,"['Mcpherson, Amy', 'Krog, Kim E']","['Ball, Geoff D', 'Cairney, John', 'Maltais, Désirée B', 'Swift, Judy A']","['Consensus', 'Disability', 'Nutrition', 'Obesity', 'Physical Activity']",21671.0,299036,"Childhood obesity is a major health problem, with 25-30% of Canadian children now overweight or obese. Children with disabilities are 2-3 times more likely to be overweight and obese than their nondisabled peers. They are also often less physically active with poorer diets. This is alarming because obesity has negative consequences for all children, but in children with disabilities, it can cause serious additional problems, such as pressure sores, pain and severe muscle loss. This makes it harder for a child to be active which puts them at greater risk of obesity, which in turn reduces independence and increases the burden on caregivers and healthcare services. Despite this, children with disabilities have mostly been excluded from health promotion programs and research. To address this inequality, we will hold a 2-day workshop in Toronto with the goal of promoting collaborations between Canadian researchers and clinicians around childhood obesity and disability. Workshop attendees (researchers, clinicians and families) will discuss existing research and hear personal experiences from families and youth. Gaps in current knowledge will be identified by attendees, and through consensus discussions, the group will select 4-5 of these gaps as priorities. Within each area, specific research questions will be formulated using a structured framework, to be pursued post-workshop. Outcomes of the workshop include a published document summarizing the discussions; a research network with a website where members can indicate their expertise and interests with a view to collaboration; one special issue of a journal dedicated to the topic of childhood obesity and disability; and a workshop at the 2015 Canadian Obesity Summit to showcase the new research network's activities. At least one grant application will be submitted based on the topics identified at the workshop, with the expectation of long-term collaboration between the attendees and others in the research community."

Obesity in childhood has been linked with a range of potentially life-threatening conditions and greater chances of being bullied and excluded. Healthcare professionals are in an ideal position to talk to children and their families about healthy weight management as they grow up, and to help them establish the foundations for a lifetime of good health. However, a number of problems have been reported by healthcare professionals, including a lack of training, time pressures, and worries that they will upset the family or trigger an eating disorder in the child by communicating in the wrong way. Furthermore, there are no guidelines around how healthcare professionals can effectively and sensitively talk about weight and obesity with children and families. The intent of this scoping review is to gather and summarize information from a range of sources to capture what is known about this topic. The scoping review will use an established sequence of steps to search, select and summarize previous research and other relevant information to understand how conversations about weight and obesity can be conducted in the best possible way (called 'best practices'). Parents and healthcare professionals working in child weight management will be involved throughout the entire review process. We will also talk to children/youth and other experts to discuss their views on what we find and how they think we can best communicate these findings to different audiences. This might include children, parents, healthcare professionals and those who write guidelines about clinical practice. The outcomes of this process will be a better understanding of what evidence exists on this topic, guidance on how healthcare professionals might best talk with children and families, and the identification of where more research needs to be done."

While we have shown the long-term impacts of the Residential School system in relation to health and wellness, there remains a large gap in understanding the health impacts of other collective traumas such as the Sixties Scoop and the continued inequities within the child welfare system. During the Sixties Scoop, large numbers of children and youth were removed from their families and the practice of taking Indigenous children and youth from their families and communities continues today. As a result, family units and connections to Indigenous culture have and continue to be impacted, however, the empirical evidence on health and wellness are largely unavailable. The current proposal addresses this gap by taking a mixed methods approach to understand the risk factors of child welfare involvement within communities and the effects of the Sixties Scoop and child welfare system on Indigenous health and wellness. In the current project we will work with large national survey data to examine the individual-level and community-level factors associated with child welfare system involvement and the impacts on health. We will also work together with the 60's Scoop Legacy of Canada, a non-profit organization focused on healing and wellness for Sixties Scoop Survivors to conduct a quantitative survey across Manitoba. Broadly we will examine experiences within the child welfare system, and the direct and intergenerational impacts of the loss of culture and community on Indigenous health and wellness. It is expected that this work will help promote an understanding of the long-term outcomes and healing opportunities required for Indigenous peoples who have been affected by the child welfare system. This work will also help provide evidence informed policy changes related to child welfare practices for Indigenous children."

Suite à une recherche-action réalisée par l'Institut de recherche pour le développement (IRD) sur les traumatismes liés aux accidents de la route au Burkina Faso, un atelier délibératif a été organisée en novembre 2015. Le but était de réunir tous les acteurs impliqués dans le domaine de la sécurité routière pour leur présenter les résultats de la recherche et de formuler un plan d'action concerté pour améliorer la situation. 

Afin d'évaluer les effets possibles de l'atelier, un questionnaire d'évaluation a été distribué aux participants et 14 entretiens qualitatifs avec plusieurs acteurs ont été réalisés 2 mois après l'atelier. Les résultats montrent que l'atelier a permis l'apprentissage de nouvelles connaissances, la création de collaborations entre les acteurs et l'opportunité d'apprendre les uns des autres.

Health educators in Education and Public Health are charged with the important task of addressing health topics with children and youth that relate to the promotion of healthy eating, active living, healthy weights, mental health wellbeing, and positive body image. Surveys of teachers from Canadian schools and anectodal reports from public health practitioners reveal that they require additional training from experts in mental health to enhance their existing health promotion expertise. Research is required to identify how best to prepare these professionals to implement optimal instructional practices that cover these important health topics, using the most up-do-date prevention practices, without triggering weight-related disorders. This requires reflection on how personal values, attitudes and interpretations of mental health, nutrition, and weight on behalf of professionals can influence their teaching practices. The proposed pilot study involves the development, implementation and pilot of a unique experiential professional development model that (1) focuses on reflective professional practice, (2) responds to two recently released mandated policy guidelines in Ontario in the sectors of Education and Public Health that relate to the promotion of healthy weights by offering timely and accessible curriculum implementation support to health educators by mental health experts, and 3) is feasible and sustainable through the long-standing collaborative relationships forged between key stakeholders on this project (Sick Kids, Public Health Managers, Nutrition Resource Centre, Ophea, Cancer Care Ontario)."

To ensure the public health workforce is appropriately knowledgeable and skilled in communication they should meet a set of competencies set out by the Public Health Agency of Canada. The pandemic and subsequent public health reports highlight the importance of communication in public health contexts. In turn, these show the public health workforces' competencies in the practice of communication are essential.  Little is known about how current and future Canadian public health professionals are trained in communication and the extent to which this training aligns with core competencies. In addition, the communication core competencies have remained the same for many years despite many changes in public health and communication, especially as we move through and past the current COVID-19 pandemic. To address these challenges, our research team will determine: how public health training in Canada supports communication competence of the current and future public health workforce; and what evidence and experts show to be new, stronger communication competencies for public health. Together, this information will help address the gaps highlighted in the Chief Public Health Officer Annual Report."

Given rising temperatures and an increase in extreme heat events, shade is especially important in the context of climate change and health. Despite its benefits and importance, there is not enough shade in many public places, including urban streetscapes, parks, and playgrounds. The lack of shade is even more pronounced in neighbourhoods with low socioeconomic status, making shade an important health equity issue. The public health importance of shade provision, and the design and implementation challenges it presents, makes for an exciting and timely opportunity for interdisciplinary public health action. Our three research objectives include: 1) determine the extent, scope, and nature of the literature on shade provision and synthesize the evidence to move knowledge into practice; 2) develop evidence-based shade design guidelines to inform interdisciplinary collaboration and intersectoral action; 3) produce visuals of creative shade design solutions to inspire action. This project lays the necessary groundwork to improve our cities' shadescapes as a form of public health action on climate change."

Designed through a community-engaged process and founded in partnership with private landowners and other local organizations, we accomplish this by installing vibrant pop-up public infrastructure that facilitates social capital and a sense of community, increases access to shade and exposure to nature, and encourages active transportation by providing on-site infrastructure. Our participation in the Copenhagen workshop, and our Toronto knowledge mobilization events, will catalyze policy change and robust collaboration between key city departments (e.g., transportation, planning, public health), resulting in an action plan for translating findings from Copenhagen to Toronto and a policy roadmap for converting places for cars to places for people."

Student-Led and Gender-Equitable Active School Travel Interventions: An Exploratory Qualitative Study,"['Medeiros, Alina']",['N/A'],"['Active School Travel', 'Elementary School', 'Gender', 'Qualitative']",1500.0,418225,"Active school travel (AST), such as walking, cycling, and rollerblading, improves children's health, air quality, and road safety. However, fewer North American children today, than in previous generations, use AST. While interventions promoting AST show improvements, the results also highlight gender inequities. At both baseline and post-intervention, boys are more likely than girls to have higher rates of AST. This research uses qualitative methods to explore children's preferences for AST interventions and identify how they differ among genders. 
Grade 5 and 6 students from two schools in London, Ontario were invited to participate in this study. In gender-based groups (n=30 groups, 5 students per group), students led researchers on a walk through their school neighbourhood (within 1 km). Throughout the walk, students took pictures and videos using Collector for ArcGIS to document their perceptions of barriers and enablers to AST. Students then used the five E's of road safety (i.e., education, encouragement, engineering, enforcement, and evaluation) as a guide to design an intervention targeting a barrier identified from the walk. Focus groups were then conducted, in which they explained and reflected on their intervention strategies. Focus groups were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and thematically analyzed in NVivo 12. 
Themes related to student-developed AST interventions will be discussed with a gender-focused lens. Girls tend to recommend interventions that aim to increase AST-related skills and change infrastructure in their environment. Whereas boys were more likely to suggest strategies addressing the social aspects of AST such as recreational facilities along the route. This research aims to address gender inequity by informing child-led and gender-based AST interventions. As AST interventions are gaining momentum and support, it is important to ensure that the interventions and programs being supported are effective and equitable among genders."

My M.A. thesis, A Cross-cultural Comparison of Illness Narratives of Seropositive Women in Kenya, Africa, and New Brunswick, Canada, demonstrated that the absence of gender-specific services and changes in HIV/AIDS policy will have negative effects on the lives of people living with this disease. My research showed that current community-based HIV programs in Atlantic Canada continue to focus on the social or behavioral needs of men living with HIV/AIDS and fail to provide services that address growing rates of infection among women. According to the Public Health Department report of HIV/AIDS in New Brunswick, 76 women are living with HIV/AIDS in the province. I propose that the effect of these changes include reduced access to appropriate healthcare services of sexual and reproductive nature, increased rates of sexually transmitted infection or disease co-infections, and continuing societal stigmatization associated with HIV infection. I will conduct semi-structured interviews with community-based HIV agencies and women living with HIV/AIDS (n=100) in the Atlantic Provinces to examine the shifting provincial health policies and evaluate the appropriateness of current HIV/AIDS healthcare services. All interviews will be facilitated from the offices of AIDS Service Organizations. I will use NVivo transcribing software to identify, organize, and code interview data. The results of my study will be made available to participants and policy makers through community workshops, pamphlets, and academic publications. These findings will also serve as a model to inform policy makers, healthcare professionals, and community-based HIV agencies about the status of HIV/AIDS across Canada, and lead to the development of gender appropriate services."

They can result in fetal deaths, newborn and child deaths, and life-long disability. Folic acid supplementation is an important intervention to prevent neural tube defects. While Health Canada has consistently recommended 0.4 mg per day (standard dose) for women at
low risk, Canadian guidelines for high doses (5 mg per day) have varied considerably over time. These variations are due, in part, to a lack of strong evidence of additional benefits of 5 mg per day folic acid. Folic acid doses higher than 1.0 mg per day are only available by prescription and are therefore exclusively initiated by physicians. Following over seven years
where high-dose folic acid was recommended widely for many potential risk factors, revised 2015 Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) guidelines considerably restricted the recommended indications for 5 mg per day folic acid. However, the impact of these more restrictive guidelines on physician prescribing practices is unclear. Furthermore, given that many women in Canada and around the world have taken high doses of folic acid,
evidence is urgently required on any potential risks and benefits associated with the use of 5 mg per day folic acid. We will use prescription claims data from British Columbia and Manitoba to study the effect of revised 2015 guidelines on 5 mg per day folic acid use among pregnant women. We will use electronic health record data from the United Kingdom to compare women who receive high and standard dose folic acid with regards to their chances of developing breast cancer later in life or having a baby with neural tube defects. This study will provide information to help inform the public and the medical community about the use of high-dose folic acid to prevent neural tube defects in Canada and the risks and benefits of high-dose folic acid supplementation."

In Canada, one in five older adults feels socially isolated. Social isolation is a known risk factor for several poor health outcomes, including disability, chronic diseases, depression, and cognitive decline. However, it remains unclear whether or not frailty worsens the effect of social isolation on health. To address this gap, the objective of my research study is to examine the effects of social isolation on frailty and poor health outcomes and to explore how this relationship varies according to different levels of frailty among older adults in Quebec."

However, the COVID-19 pandemic provided an opportunity to use innovative technologies in the creating of at home exercise opportunities for older adults.  My doctoral research investigates how technology can increase older adults' physical activity at home, especially when access to in-person exercise programs and support is limited. To do so, I use both quantitative and qualitative methods to explore how virtual reality games can encourage at-home physical activity in older adults and benefit their health and well-being.

Using a multidisciplinary approach, the proposed research study aims to assess the socioeconomic impact of 22q11DS and to test the effects of an easy-to-access online coaching intervention designed to help reduce this impact for families. First, we will conduct an online survey with 500 parents of children with 22q11DS, aged 3-15 years. In the survey parents will be asked to provide information about their own and their children's psychosocial wellbeing, barriers to care, and 22q11DS-related costs. For more in-depth information we will directly interview a subset of the parents. We expect that at least 200 parents completing the survey will indicate that their children's psychosocial wellbeing is impacted by 22q11DS. Those parents will be eligible to be included in a trial. Specifically, the 200 parents will either receive an online coaching intervention designed by the research team or standard services as usual. If proven effective, the online coaching intervention will be an important addition to the health care services already in place for these families. This intervention model will also serve as a paradigm for how to best integrate online solutions into care for other rare diseases, helping to reduce their impact on families in general."

Furthermore, from an Indigenous perspective, language is born of a specific place.  It serves to describe with powerful accuracy all the particular life existing therein, and all the sacred histories and events that happen thereupon.  Place and language thus provide the context and source of knowledge by which a person can identify or communicate social constructs of identity including gender, community and governance.  Those who do not know the language of a particular land are impoverished; without knowing place and language they are challenged to fully identify themselves as that land.   Interruption of this connection through colonization has profoundly and negatively impacted Indigenous peoples' ability to articulate a healthful, holistic identity. Indeed the disrupted connection has become a general marker of ill health. 
The purpose of this project is to develop land, language, and community-based activities in an Indigenous context to support reclamation of wellness based in local understandings of identity and health. Developing established relations with three Coast Salish Indigenous partner entities, this project will utilize funds to create meaningful community programs to support the engendering of Indigenous identity for wellbeing."

A holistic Indigenous worldview shapes the process of creating that identity. Transmotion and the Peoplehood Matrix provide theoretical and methodological points of reference for studying this process.  In ""transmotion"" Indigenous people work through and across the events of life, and live life as change. The Peoplehood Matrix, comprised of four interactive elements-language, sacred history, place/territory, ceremonial cycle-constitutes a group identity and ensures the persistence of a people.  Community-based, action-oriented activities aspire to revive, reorient and renew the expression of the Matrix where a healthy Coast Salish identity, including gender, can be re-imagined.
Wellness indicators focus on improving identification and recognition of, respect for and access to culturally relevant and holistic pathways to creating a healthy identity.  
In an Indigenous planning process, Indigenous people hold their proper governance position.  Consensus decision making and community capacity building (spiritual, sovereign, linguistic, skills oriented, administrative)-especially for youth-are central.
The proposed action plan is rooted in three basics: personal, local, small. Identity in an Indigenous community context is rooted in personal, local and small activities that engage substantively with elements of the Peoplehood Matrix.  Some proposed activities include a cross-community Elders Gathering, production and community premiering of short documentaries of community Elders teaching Coast Salish values, and language immersion day camps for youth. Later possibilities include an herbal medicine Family Camp, ceremonial transfer of salmon fry, and rebuilding of the community Pit House used for life stage ceremonies."

This will include working with HIV stakeholders (e.g., healthcare professionals, social services, CBOs) to identify gaps and barriers in healthcare services and to develop recommendations for the improvement of healthcare services that impact the quality of life for APHA. SIMFC has identified health as an important priority in developing service capacity that meets the needs of their HIV positive clients. Previous research in Saskatoon, and across Canada, has found that inequities exist in the amount and type of access to healthcare that APHA receive compared to the general population; leading to greater risk for HIV transmission, less access to treatment, and more complex health issues leading to poorer health outcomes. By working with community members to define and outline health service needs, this proposed research will be used to inform, support, and improve services provided to the APHA population."

Our reliance on such caregivers as the main providers of care will continue as the population ages and rates of dementia increase. Although family caregiving is associated with better outcomes for care recipients and most caregivers want to continue caring for as long as possible, providing dementia care and navigating available services can be challenging. In general, dementia caregivers are highly stressed and experience negative physical, social, emotional, and financial consequences. However, some caregivers thrive and maintain or improve their health, suggesting that providing care can have positive health effects under certain circumstances.
We propose to study what leads to strength in times of adversity (i.e. resilience) among dementia caregivers. By identifying resilience contributing factors and processes, we aim to improve the health and wellbeing of both dementia caregivers and those living with dementia. To do this, we will bring together dementia caregivers; renowned resilience, aging, and dementia researchers; and community stakeholders to discuss what we know about caregiver resilience, where gaps in knowledge and support provision lie, and how best to meet caregivers' needs. We will compare Nova Scotia and Ireland, as this will allow us to identify universal and contextual resilience processes between areas with similar demographics but different health and social care systems.
At our meeting, knowledge-users and researchers will be equal partners. Researchers, service providers, and dementia caregivers will discuss the latest research, policy, and practice in this area. Our collaboration will strengthen international research ties and will result in a CIHR Project Grant proposal.

Motherhood, for example, is a unique role that more than 70% of women entering addictions treatment programs fulfill. Consideration of this role is essential as these women experience increased parenting challenges and high levels of stress in relation to meeting the needs of their children. Women seeking treatment are motivated to enhance their parenting capacity, yet entering treatment can engender feelings of guilt, shame, and stigmatization that hinder engagement and positive outcomes. In response, 30 treatment programs have been locally developed across Ontario to address the complex needs of these women and their young children. As programs enter their second decade of operation and funding is being allocated to their further development, there is a need for clarifying optimal models of service delivery and evaluating outcomes. Recent research established a working model that defined services and processes underlying effective treatment for pregnant and parenting women with addictions and their children. The present research will explore the component of the model that was rated by stakeholders (clinician, research, administration, policy) as most important: Holistic and Empowering Care for Mom, Baby, and Dyad. This component defined the patient population as well as the vision and values that underlie ideal service delivery. The proposed study will examine the comparative impact of two prominent service delivery models operating in Ontario on parenting and child outcomes, and explore how child (e.g., gender) and maternal (e.g., trauma history) factors influence these relations. This work will contribute to our understanding of effective models of care for pregnant and parenting women with addictions and inform best practice guidelines for the provision of services to a marginalized and understudied population."

As such, it has been documented that older adult living in mainly Francophone regions of New-Brunswick have worse general health profiles (physical and cognitive) than those of people in mostly English-speaking regions. Sustainable prevention and management strategies delivered in rural settings, where Francophone seniors live, are therefore needed to address health disparities between French older adults and their Anglophone counterparts. Improvements in healthy living behaviours, such as uptake of a regular physical activity program is generally associated with improvements in physical function, mental health and improvements in cognition in older adults. In New Brunswick, access to such physical activity programs is of particular concern for seniors who are Francophone as they are more likely to live in rural settings and to cumulate multiple chronic conditions. A logical target for addressing these inequities is to facilitate an uptake of physical activity among Francophone seniors living in rural regions of New Brunswick. Targeting this behaviour therefore has the potential to help overcome the physical and cognitive challenges faced by Francophones living in a rural setting. The objectives of this project are to:1)Engage partners and community members in the development and delivery of a 16-weeks 'community-tailored' physical activity program in underserved rural francophone regions (Village de Memramcook), 2)Adopt an inclusive approach to encourage and facilitate engagement of community members from underserved groups, who can take part in a physical activity program and 3) Understand the role of a community physical activity program on physical and cognitive well-being in francophones (males and females) living in rural NB."

The role of IPHAs in developing these wellness interventions, however, has received little attention. The Weaving Our Wisdoms (WoW) project, designed by IPHAs, Indigenous and allied researchers, is developing land-based interventions rooted in Indigenous perspectives of wellness and guided by the wisdom of Indigenous knowledge holders who have been living long-term with HIV. In this presentation, we introduce the concept of HIV Olders, a phrase coined by WoW project IPHAs to refer to IPHA leaders, and outline the characteristics of an HIV Older.

Study Design and Objectives: The WoW project engages four complementary research approaches: community-based research, Indigenous knowledge, decolonizing methods, and two-eyed seeing. Our objective is to develop land-based HIV interventions that are ""woven"" from Indigenous perspectives of wholistic wellness and the wisdom of HIV Olders. The team's goal is to develop these interventions to support IPHAs in building their leadership and self-care. 

Preliminary Results: A land-based team meeting in Bella Bella, BC explored the concept of HIV Olders and land-based healing. Discussions were recorded and combined with field notes to identify key themes including the qualities of an HIV Older, the value of peer-to-peer engagement in the IPHA context and ways that traditional knowledge and ceremony can optimize HIV wellness. This presentation will share these findings and introduce our next phase of research; a Gathering of IPHAs to co-develop a strategy to integrate land-based healing with HIV wellness. 

Conclusion: HIV Olders is a living concept; one that will grow alongside our understanding of HIV, the resources available to support wellness living with HIV, and the reconnection to teachings about wellness through the land and through culture."

Youth in Canada are experiencing the fastest growing rates of opioid use disorder and mental illness; we know that youth who are marginalized based on their sex, gender, sexuality, race, poverty, Indigeneity, and/or have experience with the child welfare system are overrepresented in these numbers. Yet, few resources exist that integrate diverse youth voices into substance use and mental health service design that meet their unique needs. This community-based research project will address this gap, by working with youth who have lived and living experiences of substance use and mental health challenges. 

We will first establish a leadership circle that will engage a diverse group of youth including Indigenous, non-Indigenous, immigrant and refugee, LGBTQIA+, and pregnant and parenting youth, who received services from our local community partners. We will use the arts-based 'cultural probe' data collection method to create mixed-media diaries that respond to questions like 'How do you access services in your community? What barriers do you encounter?' and 'What resources would you like that will help you be healthy?' and invite the youth to discuss their diaries during interviews. 

Together we will co-create a collective vision for more meaningful and accessible substance use and mental health services, grounded in each person's own experience and recommendations. This vision will be translated into an intervention to pilot, implement, and evaluate at the Victoria Youth Clinic (Foundry Victoria) - and will inform implementation strategies for the ten other Foundry Centres across British Columbia."

Support from a CIHR Planning and Dissemination Grant and a Vancouver Foundation Convene grant has allowed the formation of a strong team of harm reduction leaders from rural and remote communities including people with lived and living experiences (PWLLEs), representatives from health authorities and community-based organizations, and academic allies. This project involves 6 virtual Working Group meetings to share knowledge, provide mutual support, and bring forward community priorities. The Working Group will then come together in person for a research planning meeting to act on the priorities laid out through the virtual meetings.  

The engagement and enthusiasm for this Working Group has been above and beyond the expectations and scope originally proposed for this work and speaks to the importance of this work for communities. The Working Group has grown to include 26 members with 10 peer leaders including Indigenous harm reduction advocates, geographically isolated PWLLEs and other underrepresented groups in research. This Café Scientifique funding would allow us to bring the additional group members to the in-person meeting and ensure that representation include key members of the public and be as diverse as possible. Given the drug poisoning crisis, research showing the overrepresentation of overdose deaths in rural communities and the unique barriers and harms experienced, it is essential and urgent that these voices are supported to come together and lead research priorities moving forward.  

This Café Scientifique meeting will benefit from the momentum of the established Working Group and provide research priority setting outside its original scope. It will also support actioning the priorities identified by this collaborative process of leaders in harm reduction in BC."

The timing of treatment initiation, however, is the subject of debate. Immediate ART after HIV diagnosis, also known as ""treatment as prevention"" (TasP), is highly effective at reducing HIV incidence among heterosexual HIV-serodiscordant couples. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding its effectiveness in real-world settings and among key populations such as men who have sex with men (MSM). In China, as HIV incidence among MSM is increasing, provision of immediate ART is under consideration by public health authorities. Given the lack of evidence globally for TasP among MSM and the need to recommend a course of action in Shanghai, this Planning Grant will be used to develop a study protocol for a prospective observational cohort among MSM in same-sex male, serodiscordant relationships in Shanghai that would investigate acceptability, retention-in-care, adherence, viral suppression, and prevention of new HIV infections within couples. To this end, the main objectives of the present grant are to: (1) discuss study feasibility, and identify key stakeholders; (2) review current work in order to identify scientific gaps and query research needs; (3) identify and evaluate recruitment modalities and sources of background data; (4) establish a joint Project Steering Committee; and (5) draft and submit a grant application to an appropriate CIHR competition. Phase One of this work will include a 10-day face-to-face workshop with members of each collaborating institution in Shanghai to make key decisions regarding the study protocol. Phase Two will consist of protocol finalization, budget, and submission. This Planning Grant is essential for the development of a study that has the potential to make a significant scientific contribution to the global evidence-base for HIV prevention in China and globally."

What impact the growing senior population will have on society in general and the health care system in particular has generated considerable debate. Although current cohorts of seniors tend to be healthier and live more independently longer as compared to previous cohorts, the likelihood of health problems increases substantially with age. Moreover, certain groups of older adults are most vulnerable to experiencing health problems, such as low-income seniors, those socially isolated, and those with intellectual disabilities who now live longer than ever. As the number of older adults increases, it becomes imperative to focus on health promotion and disease prevention in order to promote optimal health into old age. The question of how health can be enhanced and health inequities can be reduced among older adults by creating ""age-friendly"" environments is at the heart of the proposed program of research. In our research, we will systematically examine whether and under what context making communities more age-friendly improves health and reduces health inequities among older adults."

A challenge is to identify individuals at risk of, or who are experiencing social isolation or loneliness. This creates a major barrier to connect individuals with resources or supports. In this study, we aim to examine how socially isolated or lonely Canadians are in different areas in the country; that is, are there certain neighborhoods, towns, or rural areas in the country where people are more socially isolated or lonely than in others? We will also examine whether personal factors (e.g., age, health), as well as environmental factors, or factors related to where people live (e.g., rural vs. urban place of residence; relatively poorer vs. more affluent places of residence) are related to social isolation or loneliness. The study will be based on data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging and will include Canadians aged 45 to 85 years old when they were first recruited into the study."

Despite knowing this, we don't fully understand how different combinations of these early adversities affect depression in late life.

We are also exploring the complex relationship between ACEs and interactions of various socio-demographic factors in late-life depression. Social support plays a vital role in mitigating the negative effects of ACEs. We aim to identify specific types of social support that can protect different groups of people from the impact of these childhood experiences.

Our study will take a thorough approach to examine these relationships and consider how they can inform public health policies. We hope to gain valuable insights that can guide targeted interventions. Ultimately, our goal is to promote health equity by addressing the effects of early adversities and advocating for the right kind of social support.

We aim to determine the effects of carbohydrate quality on MRI assessed brain imaging and related changes to cognitive function, and to serum risk markers that will indicate potential mechanism.

Background
Because of major concerns over the health effects of unhealthy highly processed carbohydrate foods as a time when the public are advised and to eat healthy carbohydrate foods (e.g., fruits and vegetables), we plan to assess the association of the type of carbohydrate food consumption with the development of brain damage assessed by MRI indices since no studies have been carried out to assess the effects of differences in carbohydrate on brain damage and mental ability.

Methods
We will study the 11,701 participants in the PURE MIND and ALLIANCE cohorts (coming from Canada, Poland, China, India). Participants will have comprehensive measures at baseline including diet (FFQ), MRI brain scans, and mental ability testing and blood measurements as part of a metabolomic scan. We aim to collect repeat assessments in 4150 people at six years. With this information, we will have sufficient numbers to detect significant differences between different groups defined by MRI associated changes and, importantly over time, to relate MRI changes with carbohydrate quality.

Anticipated results
At baseline we believe that the degree of brain damage determined by MRI will relate to the quality of carbohydrate and over the 6-years will relate to the decline in cognitive function which will also relate to the quality of the carbohydrate. We believe blood measures (e.g., raised blood glucose) will provide an indication of mechanism.

Implications
These data will indicate the brain damage associated with aging. The link with carbohydrate quality will identify an important lifestyle change to slow this brain damage and contribute meaningfully to dietary advice for the public, and clinical practice guidelines, with changes in government subsidies and agricultural practice globally."

A cornerstone of TB control is treating TB while it is still dormant or latent, before it causes illness. The current standard treatment of latent TB is isoniazid for 9 months (9INH). This lengthy treatment is burdensome, and can sometimes cause serious side effects, so is often not taken. A potential alternative is 4 months of rifampin (4RIF), which is more rapidly effective than isoniazid - allowing the shorter duration of treatment.  A blood test that tested whether treatment of latent TB infection was effective could make it much easier to study new drugs or combinations of drugs to prevent TB, and to indicate when an individual could stop latent TB treatment. The blood tests that are most promising are measures of the immune response to TB.  We have begun a randomized trial to compare 9INH with 4RIF for the treatment of latent TB infection in almost 6,000 adults. We propose to measure results of immune response tests before, and at the end of 4RIF and 9INH. We will determine whether reduction in these immune responses is greater in persons who complete the standard treatment (9INH), or complete 4RIF, and if changes occur more rapidly with 4RIF. These results in turn will be compared to the effectiveness of the two drugs for preventing TB. Finally the most promising results will be re-tested in stored samples of blood that were gathered in an independent study of INH treatment of LTBI. This will act to confirm (validate) our results. This proposal is a unique, cost effective opportunity to compare the effect of each of these two drugs on the immune responses to TB. If these results can be correlated with the effectiveness of treatment, it could be used as a measure of treatment effectiveness for future clinical studies, allow them to be conducted more quickly, with fewer patients, and much lower costs."

TB kills more people than any other contagious disease, including AIDS. People get TB from breathing in the germs of a sick person's cough. TB is curable, but it can be difficult for people living in poverty to reach clinics to get tested or treated. We will work with churches in 4 communities to further develop a faith-led strategy to help connect people with TB symptoms to clinics and provide a supportive setting for people with TB. Church leaders helped us develop a draft strategy with 3 components:
1.         Church leaders talk about TB in weekly sermons to teach congregants about TB symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment
2.         Churchgoers with TB symptoms would meet with a health worker who also attends the church to determine if they should go to the clinic for a TB test
3.         A group of volunteer congregants are trained as ""TB Champions"" in order to help support congregants and their families who are affected by TB

To prepare to test this strategy, we will undertake the following activities:
·  Meet to discuss the scientific considerations to test the strategy
·  Work with a local faith organization to identify and select 3 congregations in each community where the strategy would be implemented
·Write grant applications to help fund the implementation and testing of the strategy
·Visit each community to meet with community leaders, clinic staff, and other partners to determine the details of the strategy that are appropriate to the local context
·Run a workshop with the leaders of the selected congregations to determine how best to implement the strategy in each church
·Attend community meetings and faith activities to help build awareness and refine the strategy
·Provide opportunities for South African collaborators to strengthen their skills in order to lead the test of the strategy once funding is secured."

To achieve the goal of ‘ending TB’, announced by Health Canada and the World Health Organization, two major problems must be addressed:1) Latent TB infection (LTBI) It is estimated that 2 billion persons world-wide have dormant or latent TB, of whom less than 1% are treated now; without treatment approximately 200 million of these will develop active TB in the next 20 years.2) Drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) is steadily increasing in all countries of the world and the emergence of highly resistant strains raises the spectre of a resurgent and untreatable epidemic. Despite occurrence of more than 1 million cases of INH resistant TB annually, there is astonishingly little research to improve the current inadequate regimens used nowMy research programme over the next 7 years will investigate pragmatic solutions to two major public health problems, using innovative methods. The first theme is how to increase the detection and treatment of LTBI to prevent TB disease. A multi-centre stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial is planned in Canada and 5 other countries. This will start with a Cascade of Care analysis – to evaluate barriers to LTBI diagnosis and treatment encountered by close contacts of TB patients. Operational modeling analysis will be used to inform selection, from a ""public health tool-kit"", of effective interventions identified in a systematic review. These interventions will then be applied in a stepwise and randomized order at participating sites, to measure the impact on contacts identified and treated successfully. Findings will inform the global roll-out of LTBI diagnosis and therapy – part of the WHO post-2015 end-TB planThe second major theme is to improve treatment of INH resistant-TB. In the first 3 years modeling studies, systematic reviews and individual patient data meta-analyses will examine treatment options for INH resistant TB, including two new drugs – Bedaquiline and Delamanid, plus Linezolid and fluoro-quinolones. This will inform selection of regimens for a multi-arm, multi-stage randomized trial among patients with INH-Resistant TB in Years 4-7.

Each of the nine Cree communities has been encouraged to get together to decide what their health priorities are and how they can be met. While many of the identified health priorities are directly related to youth (under 25 years of age), the discussions and evaluations thus far have not engaged the youth themselves, nor asked them what they think or need. The goal of this project is to give a voice to the Cree youth: to firstly review the evidence of best practices to engage Indigenous youth in health research, and ultimately to co-design a strategy to engage Cree youth in IAMP. Accordingly, we would like to ask James Bay Cree youth three questions: What do you believe to be your role in your health research and planning? What are the facilitators and barriers to such participation? And what are your priorities for change in your own health? We will adopt a community-based participatory research approach, which features the inclusion of youth as equal partners in the study. Through focus groups and individual interviews, we will gather information together with youth from the Oujé-Bougoumou Cree community who have already shown strong interest in youth involvement in health planning. This project builds upon a strong existing partnership between the Cree Health Board and McGill research team. The results will fill the missing knowledge gap for James Bay regarding what Cree youth believe to be the best strategies for engaging and gathering young 'voices' about health and healthcare, and preliminary insights on priorities."

In the 1970's, the Medical Service Branch of Health Canada (MSB-HC) undertook a surveillance program to assess First Nation's mercury exposure; blood or hair samples of 38, 571 persons from 514 First Nation communities were analyzed. The highest concentration (660µg/L) was in blood from Asubpeeschoseewagong Netum Anishinabek (ANA), also known as Grassy Narrows, whose rivers and lakes had been contaminated in the 1960's by a choralkali plant that dumped 9 tons of mercury into the Wabigoon-English river.

Although some persons from Grassy Narrows receive compensation for ""signs and symptoms similar to mercury poisoning"", based on 1985 guidelines, very few have undergone complete neurologic examinations, with therapeutic follow-up.  Minamata Disease, a progressive neurological disorder resulting from high mercury concentrations in marine fish is well documented. But, unlike marine fish, freshwater fish do not have high concentrations of nutrients (selenium and omega-3 fatty acids), which counteract some of the effects of mercury.  We have created a unique, merged database with historic longitudinal mercury biomarker data (blood, hair and cord blood), collected in Grassy Narrows between 1970 and 1997.  The objectives of this study are to describe chronic health sequelae in relation to prenatal and cumulative post-natal mercury exposure from fresh-water fish consumption, with a view to developing diagnostic tools to describe the continuum of mercury related deficits and disorders and recommend appropriate therapeutic follow-up, based on a knowledge translation and exchange approach. A total of 176 persons from Grassy Narrows will undergo a general medical examination, a  neurological examination and neuropsychological and neurophysiological tests. Persons who require further follow-up, including psychological assessment, will be referred.  Blood will be sampled and analyzed for specific nutrients and disease indicators. The results, coupled to integrated knowledge translation and exchange, will allow us to: (i) develop a comprehensive and appropriate protocols for diagnosis of mercury poisoning;  (ii) identify early signs and symptoms of mercury poisoning; (iii) propose adequate rehabilitative follow-up and care; (iv) alleviate some of the harmful consequences."

Creating Connections:  Innovative transportation solutions for older adults,"['Mérida, Walter']","['Mckay, Heather A', 'Sims-Gould, Joanie']","['Connectivity', 'Health Benefits', 'Mobility', 'Older Adults', 'Physical Activity', 'Safety', 'Transportation']",10000.0,378455,"Canadian census data released in 2016 reported that for the first time in our history there are more older adults (>=65 y) than children (<=14 y) in the general population. The proportion of seniors is projected to exceed 30% by the year 2050.

Older adult independence is limited by physical and mobility challenges. Mobility is ""the best guarantee of retaining independence ..."" and limited mobility predicts disease, disability and mortality. The transportation needs of older adults will shift with this aging and increasingly low-activity demographic. In 2009, 200,000 Canadians aged >85 held a driving license. Transportation immobility contributes to a cascade of negative effects, as increased reliance on others for transportation and inadequate transportation services (e.g. HandyDart) limits access of older adults to family, friends and community based and health care services. This in turn may negatively impact their physical, emotional and mental health -- including their ability to stay socially connected.
Given the importance of improving seniors' health in Canada, there is a desperate need for blue sky intervention strategies that offer Canada's oldest citizens accessible, affordable transportation alternatives. Ideally, these alternatives would integrate mobility, physical activity and social connectedness with safe, transportation services while considering new and renewable sources of energy. 
We propose to convene a group of experts and stakeholders to enhance the health of older adults at the population level by cultivating innovative scalable 'rideshare' transportation strategies. We will synthesize and evaluate existing evidence on transportation and health for older adults and host a catalytic think tank event. By providing a conduit for discussion, ideas, synthesis and action we ultimately aim to create and implement a sustainable, environmentally friendly transportation solution that promotes the health and social connectedness of older adults."

Predictors of Emergency Caesarean Births to Low-Risk Migrant Women,"['Merry, Lisa A']",['N/A'],"['Determiants Of Health', 'Emergency Caesarean Birth', 'Health Services Research', 'Migrant Women']",2500.0,331681,"The high number of caesarean births performed in High Income Countries (HICs) is of concern due to associated costs and health risks. Recommendations to reduce caesarean rates include preventing emergency caesareans (i.e., unplanned caesareans) among low-risk women (i.e., head down, one baby, term pregnancy), particularly for reasons that are subjective (e.g, prolonged labour). 

Pregnant migrant women (i.e., women born abroad) from low or middle income countries (LMICS) represent a growing population and might have specific health or social needs that could affect pregnancy and childbirth. The objective of this study was to identify medical, migration, social and health service predictors associated with emergency caesareans in low-risk migrant women from LMICs.

Results showed that migrant women who were admitted to the hospital in early labour, had a high body mass index or gained excessive weight during pregnancy, had poor general health, had lived in Canada less than two years, or were from Sub-Saharan Africa/Caribbean, were more likely to have an emergency caesarean than a vaginal birth. Among migrant women who lived in Canada less than two years, women who were refugees or were applying for refugee status, or had no official immigration status, were also more likely to have an emergency caesarean birth.

Strategies to reduce caesareans in migrant women need to consider medical and non-medical factors. For example, weight control pre- and during pregnancy needs to be addressed and more vulnerable migrant women, including recently-arrived, and those with a ""humanitarian"" status may need more support during labour. Early admission to hospital should be discouraged to avoid unnecessary or early interventions that may slow labour and lead to a caesarean."
Host factors associated with HPV Infection in Inuit Women of Northern Quebec.,"['Metcalfe, Stephanie']",['N/A'],"['Human Leukocyte Antigen (Hla)', 'Human Papillomavirus (Hpv)', 'Inuit Women']",1698.0,262820,"Background: The Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) complex, which is a set of genes involved in the identification of foreign antigens and activation of the immune system, has been proposed as a possible cofactor in HPV infections. 
Objectives: The frequencies of HLA alleles and haplotypes in a cohort of Inuit women in Nunavik, Northern Quebec will be described as well as their association with HPV prevalence and cytological abnormalities.
Methods: A cohort of Inuit women seeking routine care and living in four different communities of Nunavik was assembled. Cervical specimens were taken at each visit and tested for HPV-DNA. The HLA alleles were typed using DNA extracted from cervical samples taken at cohort entry using the PCR-SSP method. Using PGMY 09/11 primer set, HPV genotypes were classified by oncogenic potential as well as by alpha-papillomavirus species. Cytology was classified using the Bethesda system. Overall HPV prevalence was defined as testing positive for any HPV type, at any time over the study period. Odds ratios (OR) adjusted for age were calculated using unconditional logistic regression.
Results: We obtained complete data on 515 women. Respectively 94.6% and 91.3% of the population had the HLA-DQB1*03 and HLA-E*0103 allele. Other common alleles in this population were HLA-E*0101 (55.5%), HLA-G*010101 (52.2%), HLA-G*010102 (28.7%), and HLA-G*010401 (57.7%). HLA-G*010102 (OR= 0.64, 95% CI 0.42-0.98) and HLA-DRB1*1501 (OR= 0.36, 95% CI 0.13-1.00) alleles were significantly associated with overall HPV prevalence. HLA-E*0101 was significantly associated with prevalence of either a Low or High Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (LGSIL or HGSIL) (OR= 1.65, 95% CI 1.13-2.41).  Further analysis on HPV incidence, persistence and multiple HPV infections will also be presented.
Conclusion: The distribution of HLA alleles in Inuit women of Nunavik differs greatly from that observed in Caucasian and black populations."
Host Factors Associated with HPV Infection in Inuit Women of Northern Quebec,"['Metcalfe, Stephanie']",['N/A'],"['Human Leukocyte Antigen (Hla)', 'Human Papillomavirus (Hpv)', 'Inuit Women']",2500.0,268646,"<<<   OBJECTIVES   >>> 
The association between Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) alleles, haplotypes and genotypes and HPV period prevalence, persistence, and Squamous Intraepithelial Lesions (SILs) in a cohort of Inuit women in Nunavik, Quebec will be investigated. The HLA complex, which is a set of genes involved in the identification of foreign antigens and activation of the immune system, has been proposed as a possible co-factor in HPV infections. 
<<<   METHOD   >>> 
A cohort of 548 Inuit women seeking routine care and living in four different communities of Nunavik, Quebec was assembled. Cervical specimens were taken at each visit and tested for HPV-DNA. HPV genotypes were classified by alpha-papillomavirus species: alpha group 1 includes low risk (LR) cervical species, group 2 includes high risk (HR) cervical species, and group 3 includes LR vaginal species. The HLA alleles were typed using DNA extracted from cervical samples taken at cohort entry. All odds ratios were adjusted for age. 
<<<   RESULTS   >>>  
HLA-G*010102 was associated with a significantly decreased risk of overall (OR=0.64 95% CI=0.42-0.98) HPV period prevalence. HLA-G*010101 (and its homozygous and heterozygous genotypes) were associated with an increased risk of LR alpha groups 1 and 3. The homozygous HLA-G*010401 genotype was associated with a decreased risk of LR alpha group 3 infection. No HLA alleles, haplotypes or genotypes were significantly associated with HPV persistence. The HLA-DRB1*13 allele was associated with an increased risk of any SIL and LGSIL.
<<<   IMPLICATIONS AND IMPACT   >>>   
Several alleles (G*010101, G*010102, and G*010401) were significantly associated with HPV period prevalence, but no alleles were significantly associated with HPV persistence, which suggests that HLA polymorphisms may play a greater role in the acquisition of an HPV infection rather than virus clearance."
Investigating the Contextual Effects Associated with Intimate Partner Violence and its Negative Health and Economic Consequences in Toronto: Longitudinal Analyses of the Neighbourhood Effects on Health and Wellbeing (NEHW) Study,"['Metheny, Nicholas']",['N/A'],"['Contextual Effects', 'Healthcare Costs', 'Intimate Partner Violence', 'Neighbourhood Effects']",90000.0,397147,"Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a major health concern in Canada, with more than 20% of women experiencing physical, sexual, or emotional violence from a male partner. Indigenous Canadians, those in same-sex partnerships, and transgender people often experience IPV at much higher rates. IPV is associated with negative health outcomes such as anxiety, depression, sexually-transmitted infections, and suicide. Considering IPV is a social problem, it stands to reason that some of the risk of experiencing IPV stems from the characteristics of where a person lives. However, research into which aspects are associated with IPV and how best to mitigate them is still relatively new. Known as contextual effects, these factors consist of neighbourhood characteristics (i.e. community wealth, neighbourhood safety, access to healthcare, greenspace) and the social norms prevalent in each community (i.e. gender and cultural norms).  We propose to use individual- and neighbourhood-level data from a 2011 survey of 2,412 Toronto residents to examine the aspects of a person's environment that are associated with IPV. By combining this data with respondents' Ontario Health Insurance Program number, we also follow respondents' health outcomes and expenditures from 2011-2018. This allows us to investigate which contextual effects are associated with patterns of reporting IPV to healthcare providers since 2011, as well as how IPV is associated with long-term health outcomes and costs in different environments. A novel analysis will be able to examine not just whether IPV is associated with health outcomes and increased costs, but the rate of the increase- something never done in the Canadian context. A better understanding of the contextual effects pertinent to IPV, as well as how these are associated with health outcomes and healthcare costs, can focus policies and interventions aimed at reducing the toll IPV places on individuals, neighbourhoods, and the healthcare system in Canada."

Anti-mask rallies, blatant disregard for restrictions related to social gatherings and circulation of disinformation regarding vaccine safety and efficacy suggest there is public distrust in social institutions, particularly with regards to the management of the pandemic. Through interviews and a national survey, we will identify the nature and extent of Canadians' trust in social institutions, particularly as it relates to the acceptance of measures to reduce COVID-19 transmission (e.g. vaccine uptake, social distancing, lockdowns, wearing a mask). Drawing on these data, we will develop tailored strategies to (re)build public trust in social institutions as a means for increasing public acceptance of measures. Through our established infrastructure for dissemination, we will target public health decision-makers, communication specialists and community leaders nationally. Our strategies will be promoted to individuals across social institutions involved in pandemic management, from high level government officials to individual public health units. Importantly, we will take a targeted approach to translation, identifying knowledge users as data illustrate populations where strategies to build trust are most needed.

This video is intended for elementary school-aged children and is designed to promote physical activity by describing the physiological effects of exercise on bone health in an age-appropriate manner. The setting of the video takes place in a classroom during science period, where three children named Mai, Arjun, and PJ engage in a thought-provoking conversation about bones with their science teacher, Ms. Z. They begin by asking how exercise makes them grow, after which Ms. Z explains the role that exercise plays in bone growth. The children also learn about the importance of exercise-induced molecules, which Ms. Z refers to as exercise messengers, in relaying messages from different organs in the body to cells that are found in bone tissue. These cells, called osteoblasts and osteoclasts, respond to these messages by breaking down and forming new bone tissue, all of which contributes to the growth of bone. Ms. Z also emphasizes to the children the importance of engaging in an active life style so that exercise messengers and bone cells continue to work together to build healthier and stronger bones. By the end of the lesson, the children are motivated to move and suggest to play a game of tag, inviting Ms. Z to play along with them. 
Exercise Messengers was created as an end-of-grant knowledge translation chapter of a doctoral thesis project, which investigates the effects of exercise on physiological regulators of bone in children and adults. The development of this video at a graduate level exemplifies the prioritization of knowledge translation initiatives at the early stage of knowledge generation. Furthermore, it builds a generation of researchers who prioritize public interest throughout all stages of their work, which leads to improved child and family health outcomes across the country."

Les données sont collectées auprès de 250 enfants d'âge scolaire (8-14 ans) qui ont participé au Nunavik Child Development Study (2005-2010). Nous avons effectué des mesures de poids et de taille et évalué les concentrations plasmatique de ces acides aminés, du glucose et de l'insuline. Nous avons réparti la population d'étude en 3 groupes selon le statut pondéral. Et nous avons étudié la variation de la concentration des marqueurs métabolomiques selon les groupes d'étude. Les prévalences du surpoids et de l'obésité ont été respectivement de 20.3% et 6.6%. L'augmentation des concentrations de 2 de ces acides aminés (la valine et la tyrosine) a été fortement associée au statut pondéral.

It is a major cause of babies' death in Canada. CHD can cause severe disability. Patients with CHD may require life time cardiac care. Previous studies have shown that the chance to have babies with CHD among poor families and certain minority groups is higher than that among rich families or other ethnic groups. However, results are vague and inconsistent. There are substantial limitations in previous studies, which make the results biased and difficult to interpret. In Canada, at least 50,000 children are born into poverty, and one in every 100 infants are born with CHD. Considering that Ontario consists of 39% of Canada's population and one third of Ontarians are visual minorities, health inequity would be a major concern in prenatal health if pregnant women from poor and vulnerable families or minority groups have an increased risk of CHD in offspring. Therefore, we plan to study if mothers from a minority group or who live in poor, less educated, or socially deprived neighbourhoods have an increased chance to have babies with CHD. We are going to link several big data sources, including the BORN Information System (BIS) birth registry data, the CIHI data, and the Census data collected by different organizations and equity index scores developed by experienced Canadian researchers. All databases are available. Therefore, no extra cost on data collection is needed. Findings from this study will help us better understand the causes of CHD and further develop strategies for the CHD prevention. The results of this study could have important recommendations for health policy to improve health inequity in Canada."

It involves ""the conditions in which they are born, grow, play, work, live, and age""- what are known as the Social Determinants of Health. Together these conditions provide the resources children need to have their basic needs met. Yet, we can have all of our basic needs met, but still be far off from living meaningful and enjoyable lives. 

Having the conditions and opportunity to develop a healthy spirituality is a strong determinant of human flourishing. The spiritual dimensions of life shape how people see the world and their place in it and give meaning to personal and collective experiences. The goal of this project grant is to generate new evidence about how spirituality operates as a social determinant of health in young Canadians. A specific focus will be to explore how socioeconomic marginalization shapes the opportunity to develop a deep sense of spirituality in children.  

Using both survey data and gathering young people's own stories, we want to understand how socioeconomic contexts shape the development of spirituality in the lives of young people and in turn, how spirituality shapes the health experiences of young people. To answer these questions we will bring together new analyses of national and international health surveys with information from a series of interviews with young Canadians. Integration of all study findings will help to establish spirituality as a positive social determinant of health, inform interventions and the development of culturally responsive and accessible approaches to supporting health, and enrich the evidence base for health policy. The involvement of young people throughout will enrich our project. We hope to open up alternatives for thought and action by re-imagining the social determinants of health to include spirituality as a condition that empowers young people to live flourishing lives."

En effet, des données récentes indiquent que pour chaque heure de sommeil perdue, l'efficacité au combat diminue de 15 à 25%. Outre la diminution de l'efficacité, le manque de sommeil accroit également le risque d'accidents liés au froid, augmente la fatigue, diminue les performances physiques et cognitives et affecte l'humeur. Afin d'optimiser leurs performances et atténuer l'impact des missions, les militaires participent à des formations d'environ deux semaines, se déroulant dans des environnements hostiles, tels que l'Arctique. Nos travaux de recherche ont révélé que les recommandations en matière de sommeil sont inatteignables en raison des conditions de travail. Actuellement, environ 60% des forces armées américaines dorment moins de six heures par nuit. Ce manque de sommeil n'affecte pas seulement les missions en cours, mais aussi la phase ultérieure. Par exemple, des militaires se préparant à un déploiement de six mois en Afghanistan signalent souvent une somnolence diurne et une mauvaise qualité de sommeil avant leur départ. Dormir moins de six heures avant une mission augmente aussi le risque de développer un trouble de stress post-traumatique, entraînant des coûts estimés à plus de 3.1 milliards de dollars par an. Malgré l'adaptation progressive visée par ces formations, la problématique du manque de sommeil persiste. Alors que la littérature existante repose principalement sur l'évaluation subjective du sommeil, les études utilisant des mesures objectives du sommeil dans ces environnements sont rares. Ainsi, notre objectif est d'évaluer objectivement l'impact du sommeil sur la santé et les performances des militaires. Nous anticipons que les militaires ayant un sommeil régulier dans les semaines précédant l'entrainement conserveront des performances élevées et présenteront moins d'accidents liés au froid par rapport à leurs pairs dont le sommeil est irrégulier."

In March 2019, however, the Canadian government declared its intention to ""work with provinces and territories towards creating a National School Food Program"". 
School food programs and policies are largely developed in isolation across health, education, research and community partners. This isolation has limited data sharing, capacity building, and knowledge mobilization, and slowed progress towards equal health outcomes for all children and youth. Programs that exist are usually targeted at children perceived as ""needing"" them, and not delivered in accordance with the best evidence approach of universality. Families struggle to introduce healthy foods for a variety of reasons; universal programs contribute to supporting the health of all children and youth when they ensure the needs of marginalized populations are met, and programs are offered, stigma-free. This project supports good nutrition for Canadian children and youth, including those marginalized, through bringing together key partners to mobilize knowledge and policy towards school food programs that meet the needs of all children, youth and families."
Do genetic and social factors modify associations between sensory impairment and cognitive decline? An analysis of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging,"['Mick, Paul', 'Campos, Jennifer L', 'Gan-Or, Ziv', 'Phillips, Natalie A', 'Pichora-Fuller, Margaret K', 'Wittich, Walter', 'Young, Terry-Lynn']",['N/A'],"['Apolipoprotein E', 'Cognition', 'Epidemiology', 'Genetics', 'Hearing', 'Senses', 'Social Isolation', 'Vision']",70000.0,410730,"Sensory loss and cognitive problems are very common in older adults. Importantly, vision and hearing loss are correlated with cognitive decline, above and beyond what is expected due to aging alone. The reason(s) remain uncertain, and not everyone is affected equally. On average, people with higher levels of sensory loss have a greater likelihood of experiencing cognitive decline, but there are exceptions to the rule. 

Our research aims to understand if genetic and/or social factors affect the degree to which hearing and vision are associated with cognitive decline. The results may help clarify underlying mechanism(s), and identify individuals with sensory loss who are most at risk, who might be targeted for interventions that aim to slow cognitive declines. 

First, we will determine if genes that cause both sensory loss and cognitive decline explain the associations. We will investigate the apolipoprotein E gene, since having the epsilon-4 version of the gene is a major risk factor for cognitive decline, and may also increase the risk of hearing and vision loss. 

Second, we will assess if social isolation affects the association. Social interaction is thought to stimulate the brain and protect it from cognitive decline. Hearing and vision loss, however, may disrupt communication and social participation and lead to isolation and loneliness. If our hypothesis is correct, the association between sensory loss and cognitive decline would be mediated by social isolation. 

The study will use data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, which includes 30,000 participants from across the country who have health measures collected every 3 years. We will have access two sets of data for every participant: Their baseline data (collected in 2012-2015) and their 3-year follow-up data (collected in 2015-2018). Sensory, social and genetic information will be ascertained from the baseline data, and change in cognition will be assessed using data from both time points."
Predictors of Healthy Cognitive Aging in the Oldest Old,"['Middleton, Laura E']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Cognitive Impairment', 'Cognitive Performance', 'Dementia', 'Prevention', 'Risk Factors']",150000.0,177171,"People aged 85 years or older are the fastest growing segment of the population, described as the ""oldest old"". Up to 50% of oldest old have Alzheimer's disease and more have other forms of dementia. Although the incidence of dementia increases with age, it is not an unavoidable part of aging. Some people maintain cognitive health despite extreme age. However, there is little research to indicate the factors that are most likely to lead to dementia or, alternatively, healthy cognitive aging in the oldest old. If we can identify lifestyle and other factors that are associated with the healthy cognitive aging, we may be able to develop interventions to maintain cognitive health in people who are at high risk of cognitive impairment based on age alone. 

In these studies, we will examine how lifestyle variables and physiological indicators are associated with the risk of cognitive impairment in the oldest old. With the results of these studies, we aim to develop strategies to prevent or treat dementia in the oldest old."

The goal of the intervention is to improve the following health outcomes: body mass index (BMI), abdominal obesity, total cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and exercise tolerance. We will test the following hypotheses: 1) A community-based program, with an inter- professional team will effectively improve the health and well-being of adults at high risk for cardiovascular events in both rural and urban setting; and 2) Adults at high risk for cardiovascular events will have better nutritional, exercise and self-efficacy outcomes when participating in a program that includes a goal setting component. This quasi-experimental study involves a 12-month intervention: the first 6 months involves exercise under the guidance of Certified Exercise Physiologist (CEP), a nutritional component under the guidance of a Registered Dietician (RD) and half of the group will be taught to goal set under the guidance of a psychologist. The intervention will be evaluated in both a rural and urban community environment. The last 6 months of the intervention consists of assisted self-management for the participants."

Although the cancer mortality rate among young adults is substantial, the majority survive the experience and go on to live long lives. Many young adults with cancer face physical, social and psychological challenges because of their age at diagnosis and the subsequent late effects caused by cancer treatments.  Some of the specific issues young adults with cancer face include: fertility and sexuality problems; interrupted education and work careers; relationship difficulties; and the inability to secure proper health and life insurance policies.  
The Canadian Strategy for Cancer Control (CSCC) has identified the need for a national model of cancer follow-up/supportive/rehabilitative care, particularly for young adult cancer survivors, so that their survivor years can be lived with minimal levels of illness and other problems. The CSCC argues that evidence-based follow-up (supportive or rehabilitative) care guidelines should incorporate psychological and sociological needs. 
The proposed research project focuses on young adults diagnosed with cancer between the ages of 18 and 34 in Atlantic Canada.  The overall goal of the research is twofold: 1)To  identify the gaps in the current model of  cancer follow-up care for young adults in Atlantic Canada; 2)Based on the knowledge gained, to modify the current model of cancer follow-up care to include psycho-social issues. 
This project would be the first step towards an evidence-based follow-up care model in Atlantic Canada. We seek to interview between 50 to 60 young adults in Atlantic Canada and learn about their physical and psycho-social needs in follow-up care."

The team developed an intervention based on moderate physical activity, nutritional education and goal setting, over a 12 month period, for two rural and two urban groups of people with obesity. The good news is that the active six month intervention was successful and participants' health outcomes improved considerably. The not so good news is that after the six months of self-management many of the participants' health outcomes reverted back to base-line. The bad news is that the intervention had a high drop-out rate. From the study we learned that it is difficult for many people living with obesity to make lifestyle change, but it is not impossible and is worth doing.

It has recently been reviewed that there are several key areas of research involving the development of human neurons and toxicity from industrial chemicals that require investigation.  Early in fetal development, there are no neurons but only neural stem cells and immature neural progenitors; neurons emerge later in gestation.  Since these neural stem cells and progenitors ultimately give rise to neurons in the developing embryo, it is important to assess toxicity in these cell types and analyze the effects of environmental agents on central nervous system (CNS) development. In this study, the effects of environmental chemical exposure on the function of cultured embryonic neural precursors or mature embryo-derived neurons will be determined.  The three main goals are to test whether environmental chemicals a) alter the function of embryonic mouse neural precursor cells, b) trigger axonal degradation of mature neurons and c) disrupt redox-mediated molecular signaling in embryonic mouse neural progenitor cells. The results of this study will help analyze the effects of environmental agents on CNS development, which will allow for a possible answer to a growing concern in human health: the effect of environmental chemicals on the developing brain."

These technologies utilize environmental and person-based (i.e. body-worn) sensors, and communications networks to provide important information on the health and care needs of seniors. As well as clinical applications, ICTs offer huge opportunities for gerontological research, particularly in respect to the collection of real-time data on the daily lives and health behaviours of older individuals.

The goal of CLSA-TECH will be to exploit the research opportunities afforded by ICTs through a partnership with the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) to collect a longitudinal real-time data set that will include both sensor and health data from the homes and communities of older people.  This data set will be collected, developed, and stored with the intention of it becoming part of the CLSA platform that researchers can use in their own research programs.  

Preliminary discussions with various groups and researchers involved in the ICT field, gerontology researchers, and current members of the CLSA have indicated strong interest and support for the idea of CLSA-TECH.

FASD affects nearly 1% of Canadians and the rate is even higher in many Aboriginal communities in Canada. This proposed research project aims to improve the personal health of people with FASD who live in First Nations communities and to improve the health of the entire FASD population living in Canada. 
This project will take place in a First Nations community that is working to lower their extremely high rates of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Our previous work with this community has shown that FASD is contributing to their high STI rates, and that the community wants to help those community members with FASD. 
We need to find out what the sexual health of people with FASD looks like, and how we can improve the sexual health of Aboriginal people with FASD though research and intervention.
This study will administer a survey to collect information about sexual health, like condom use and risky sexual behaviours, from people with FASD living in our collaborating First Nations community. Then we will do interviews with people with FASD, their health care workers and family to find out how we can create a sexual health intervention for people with FASD living in the community.
This project will help the collaborating community begin to heal the STI problems they face. Also this project is important for people with FASD across Canada and the world, because it will bring attention and resources to studying and improving the sexual health of people with FASD."

finish school, avoid drug problems, and have productive family lives and careers as adults. For some children with ADHD, even though they are receiving other treatments such as medication or therapy, they still have difficulty with their peer relationships.

We have found, however, that parents may be able to help their children with ADHD to make better friendships. This study tests a new treatment to train parents to be ""friendship coaches"" for their children with ADHD when their children are in elementary school. We are examining the ways in which parents can help their children with ADHD to learn better social skills, to choose the right friends, and to develop good bonds with peers.

Our hope is that this treatment will help children with ADHD to get along better with their peers, which will lead to these children having happier and healthier lives as teenagers and adults. If the treatment is successful, then we will be able to offer this service to families of children with ADHD in the future."

Breastfeeding rates are lowest among vulnerable mothers, such as those of low socio-economic status, lower education level and younger age.  The Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program (CPNP) operates through community agencies to improve the birth outcomes of vulnerable mothers.  The CPNP has been successful in increasing breastfeeding initiation rates in this population, but sustained breastfeeding requires ongoing postnatal support which is not routinely provided.  This research will therefore study the effects on breastfeeding practices of providing postnatal breastfeeding support for vulnerable mothers as an extension to the CPNP at two sites in Toronto.  The intervention will include access to a professional lactation consultant and a high-quality breast pump.  Data on infant feeding practices will be collected from study participants at regular intervals over the first six months of infant life.  CPNP staff and study participants will be interviewed to learn about their experiences with the intervention and its strengths and limitations.

Although these conditions mostly affect adults, their origins can be traced back to early childhood, infancy and even before birth. Signs and symptoms that precede these serious conditions include obesity, abnormal cholesterol and high blood pressure, and are often referred to as cardiovascular disease (CVD). The causes of CVD are unknown, but many risk factors have been proposed, including mothers' health and poor nutrition. The role of the fathers in the origins of CVD is understudied. Since prevention might be possible if early signs and risk factors can be addressed, it is critical to understand the role of fathers in the origins of CVD.

The objective of this project is to evaluate the contribution of fathers' health  to CVD risk factors in children (from birth until the age of 8 years) in the CHILD Cohort Study. 

The CHILD study has followed many Canadian children and their families, from when the mother was pregnant until the child turned 8 years of age, to collect information about the health, diet and experiences of the parents and children. In this project, we will use this information to determine fathers' impact on children's health. We propose to analyze existing data to calculate a father's scale of CVD and relate those to children's CVD risk factors from birth until the age of 8 years. 

This study provides the unique opportunity to directly determine whether periconception modifiable factors, such as paternal health, are related to cardiovascular health in children after accounting for maternal factors (e.g., health & diet). 
Our research will inform evidence-based recommendations for preconception paternal health and contribute to new strategies for preventing these serious conditions in future generations of Canadian children."

Supported by evidence that suggests many adolescents in South Africa experience transactional sex, sexual violence, lack of control over condom use and multiple concurrent sexual partnerships, emerging trends propose a dramatic rise in HIV infection rates at the age of sexual debut. This is especially true for young women.  Notably, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria has recently noted the gap in HIV research involving adolescents, and the associated missed opportunities to link HIV prevention with sexual and reproductive health services for adolescents. However, few studies have attempted to explore HIV vulnerability among adolescents through research that, actively engages young people in the research process to develop and implement programs and policies that reflect their lived realities. More significantly, research proposes that the lack of acknowledgement of the concept of adolescence in addressing the needs of SA youth is an underlying factor associated with adolescent sexual health messaging. Needed is a youth-driven research tool that breaks down the stigma associated with sex; especially at an age where conformity is the norm. 
The proposed research project involves the development of an innovative, participatory arts-based research tool for meaningful engagement with adolescents at high risk for HIV transmission and who live in a culture of sexual censorship. Its objectives are: 1: to adapt the art and therapeutic tool of Body Mapping into a qualitative research tool for engaging adolescents in HIV prevention research; 2: to use Body Mapping to explore adolescent knowledge and attitudes related to HIV vulnerability, testing, and prevention; 3: To utilize Body Mapping to explore the use of youth-driven research methodologies to inform best practices for HIV prevention among youth"

Moreover, epidemiological evidence regarding vulnerability to these three conditions among young Aboriginal women suggests that historical traumas may be colluding with more recent traumas including homelessness, sexual abuse and survival sex work. However, there remains a dearth of evidence regarding effective drug prevention programs and policies for adolescents generally, and much less for young women who may be coping with multi-layered traumas. The proposed research seeks to address the paucity of young Aboriginal women's voices in drug use prevention by building on a unique and strong Aboriginal research partnership in British Columbia, Canada to contribute new evidence regarding risk and resiliency to injection drug use among at-risk (defined as using illicit drugs in the previous month other than marijuana) Aboriginal adolescent (aged 14-19 years) women. To accomplish this we will utilize ethnographic methods to qualitatively explore the following 4 objectives; investigate the relationships between trauma, resiliency and transitioning to injection drug use; examine the intersection between cultural safety and harm reduction; explore the role of specific drugs and their respective transition trajectories and; synthesize the evidence to develop a framework for action towards the prevention of injection drug use for at risk adolescent Aboriginal women. This research will generate much needed evidence to inform drug prevention policy targeted towards those most at risk in Canada."

The current discussion will begin with an overview of anxiety, which includes the various causes and symptoms of childhood anxiety, as well as how to detect problematic levels of anxiety. Anxiety disorders are related to a variety of personal and social difficulties, including higher rates of depression, adolescent suicide, increased use of tobacco, alcohol misuse, poor social relationships, lower academic achievement, school avoidance, and impaired family cohesion and functioning (Ost & Treffers, 2001). When mental health problems are left untreated, the cost-of-illness, both to the patient and society, are high (Bodden, Dirksen & Bogels, 2008). The burden of illness attributable to mental disorders accounts for 15% of the total disability-adjusted life years associated with all illnesses, second only to cardiovascular illness (Joubert, 2001). These staggering figures may be reduced if mental health difficulties are identified, diagnosed and treated early in life. The current Café Scientifique forum will invite discussion about detecting and preventing anxiety in early childhood."
Dietary carbohydrate quality and brain health in diverse populations,"['Miller, Victoria E']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Biochemistry', 'Cognition', 'Dementia', 'Epidemiology', 'Global Health', 'Nutrition', 'Population Health']",90000.0,454914,"Dementia and cognitive decline are major health problems in low (LIC), middle (MIC) and high-income countries (HIC). Lifelong nutrition is believed to be important for brain health, but most research has focused on other chronic health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and few studies have investigated the effect of diet on cognitive function and brain injury. The quality of carbohydrate intake (fiber, whole grains, food glycemic index) has been shown to have a significant influence on overall health and risk of stroke, but has not been well studied in relation to cognition and brain health. Nutrition research is challenging as diet is difficult to measure accurately, changes over time and is influenced by socioeconomic factors. In addition to traditional nutritional science methods, contemporary laboratory approaches that include measuring metabolites (metabolomics), proteins (proteomics) and using information from genetic markers (genomics and Mendelian randomization) are useful for providing deeper knowledge of the pathways from carbohydrate quality to brain injury and cognitive function. This project will take a critical step toward investigating nutrition and brain health in an international cohort of 4,150 adults from Canada, Poland, China and India. First, I will investigate the association of carbohydrate quality with cognitive function, MRI indices of brain damage and both with the metabolomic and proteomic signals of glycemic control and inflammation. Second, I will examine whether carbohydrate quality is associated with changes in cognitive function and anatomical new brain injury during a 6-yr follow-up period. Together, these findings will help to address an important gap in advancing the evidence for the role of carbohydrate quality on neurodegeneration and dementia."

We will document recent trends in life-expectancy and healthy ageing inequality by income, gender and other socio-economic backgrounds. We will use administrative data to bring together information on income, occupation, residence and death records and construct detailed measures of mortality inequalities, and assess how these have changed across recent cohorts. Using survey data on health at older ages, we will estimate inequalities of healthy ageing by gender and socio-economic background .  

We will also study how the looming increase in care needs generates additional inequalities for carers and those needing care. We will analyse how the gender gap in informal care - elderly care is overwhelmingly provided by women - is related to labour market and pension inequalities."

Residence in privately-owned SRA housing has previously been linked to increases in HIV risk behaviors. However, over the past decade, governments have increased investment in SRA housing by converting buildings into social housing to respond to health crises experienced by unstably housed persons (e.g., PWUD). Low-income housing stock available to PWUD now includes SRA encompassing diverse operating models (e.g., abstinence-based, harm reduction) and varying conditions (e.g., newly-renovated, slums), which have significant implications for HIV prevention and treatment. Perhaps nowhere is this issue more pressing than in Vancouver, British Columbia's Downtown Eastside neighbourhood, which is home to approximately 3,000 SRA housing units and overlapping HIV/AIDS and drug use epidemics. In response to concerns of peer-driven organizations regarding potential influences of evolving SRA housing environments on HIV prevention and treatment, we propose to build a novel community-based participatory research study upon an existing program of ethno-spatial epidemiological research to explore the influence of social, structural, and physical conditions in SRA housing on HIV prevention and treatment among PWUD. The project team is a collaborative partnership between the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, Pivot Legal Society, and peer-driven organizations in the Downtown Eastside. Affected community members have contributed to the development of this project and have joined our project team as Knowledge Users.

People addicted to illicit drugs, especially those who use them via intravenous injection, suffer high levels of preventable morbidity and mortality from a variety of causes. Although much research to date has focused on interventions to prevent new cases of HIV and HCV, the determinants of access and adherence to treatment for these infections remain poorly investigated. Understanding ways to optimize treatment outcomes among drug users is becoming increasingly important, especially in light of new efforts to eliminate new cases of HIV through improved testing and care, such as the United Nations' recently announced 90-90-90 initiative, based on the Treatment-as-Prevention (TasP) approach. Over the next five years, my goal is to continue to develop my programme of rigorous and consequential research that contributes to efforts to reduce the extremely elevated rates of morbidity, mortality and associated healthcare costs among people addicted to illicit drugs. The objectives of my research programme are to identify contextual barriers to optimal HIV care; map areas of elevated levels of uncontrolled HIV infection and investigate their causes; evaluate new efforts to improve HIV/AIDS treatment outcomes, like harm reduction-based services; and evaluate knowledge and attitudes towards new treatments for hepatitis C virus infection. I will address these objectives using data from the ACCESS study, my ongoing prospective cohort study of approximately 900 HIV-positive people who use illicit drugs living in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside.

Our team has documented some benefits of cannabis use among people who use drugs. The benefits include reductions in the frequency of crack cocaine use, and engagement in opioid addiction treatment among others. However, little is known about the type of cannabis, route of administration, dose and dosage that people who use illicit drugs are using for harm reduction, the rates of problematic cannabis use among them, as well as other social and legal consequences of using cannabis. In light of these important gaps in knowledge, we propose to collect data from among marginalized people who use drugs taking part in our studies and catalyze new lines of inquiry into the links between cannabis use, cannabis use disorder, the harms from other drug use, and cannabis legalization in a setting with a community-wide opioid overdose crisis."

The impacts of this policy framework among emerging adults (EA) and structurally-marginalized people who use drugs (PWUD) are of particular concern given high rates of cannabis initiation and use, as well as vulnerability to drug-related harm among these populations. The uptake of cannabis products from regulated sources is an important measure of the performance of Canada's public health framework for cannabis since products from the unregulated market (e.g., high-THC edibles, synthetic cannabinoids) can exacerbate the risk of cannabis-related harms. Characterizing patterns of cannabis access, identifying barriers to using regulated products, and investigating links with cannabis-related harms and potential benefits among members of high-risk populations will help inform measures to promote transitions into the regulated market and increase engagement with the public health framework.
In light of these knowledge gaps, we propose to address the following research questions:
1.What are the barriers and facilitators of accessing regulated cannabis markets?
2.How do cannabis access patterns promote or reduce the risk of cannabis-related harms?
3.What are the links between cannabis access patterns and outcomes from cannabis substitution and other therapeutic uses of cannabis?
Our team of established and emerging investigators has extensive expertise in epidemiology and public health, drug use and addiction, psychology, and the translation of research findings into public policy and clinical practice. In collaboration with our knowledge users, our proposed activities will leverage existing data sources from two sentinel populations (four ongoing longitudinal cohorts) to produce novel policy- and practice-relevant evidence to maximize the benefits of the legal and regulated cannabis framework."
Using social network theory to explore nutritional risk in community-dwelling older adults in Canada,"['Mills, Christine M']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Longitudinal', 'Nutrition', 'Nutritional Risk']",,443313,"One-third of Canadians over the age of 65 who live at home, in their communities, are at increased nutritional risk. Nutritional risk is the risk of poor food and beverage intake. The consequences of increased nutritional risk include increased frailty, decreased quality of life, increased hospitalization, and higher mortality rates.

Many social network changes occur with aging that can affect dietary intake and therefore nutritional risk. Some changes may involve living circumstances (for example, living alone), widowhood, participation in community activities, and support from others. While there have been studies examining the social network factors associated with nutritional risk, there is a lack of studies investigating the social network factors associated with changes in nutritional risk. Also, few studies have looked at whether a program designed to improve social network connections can improve nutritional risk. This research will attempt to address those gaps.

This study, therefore, aims at discovering the social network factors associated with nutritional risk and changes in nutritional risk, and whether a program designed to improve social network connections can also improve nutritional risk. It will examine the social network factors associated with nutritional risk in two groups: older adults in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) a national cross-Canada group of older adults, and older adults from Oasis Seniors' Supportive Living (Oasis), a program that delivers services to older adults living in natural retirement communities, such as an apartment building. The study will also examine the social network factors associated with changes in nutritional risk using data from the CLSA. Finally, the study will investigate if participation in Oasis improves nutritional risk.

This study's results should help design programs, policies, and services aimed at improving the nutritional risk status of community-dwelling older adults in Canada."

Exploring Differential Impacts of Chronic Condition Self-management Policies and Interventions on Disadvantaged Populations in British Columbia: A Health Equity Assessment,"['Mills, Susan L', 'Mcquillen, Kelly']","['Fong, Maylene', 'Geber, Joan', 'Goldsmith, Laurie J', 'Greaves, Lorraine J', 'Pederson, Ann P', 'Ponic, Pamela L', 'Young, Lynne E']","['Chronic Conditions', 'Disadvantaged Populations', 'Health Equity Analysis', 'Policy Research', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Self-Management Policies And Interventions']",74950.0,191738,"More than 13 million Canadians report chronic conditions. But some individuals, particularly disadvantaged women experience worse consequences than others from having illnesses. This is partially due to the fact that the living conditions are not optimal for managing long term challenges or promoting health for disadvantaged groups (e.g., living in poverty or isolation). Interventions (called 'self-management' programs) have been developed to help individuals better manage their chronic conditions by learning healthier behaviours. Governments and communities across Canada are widely implementing these programs and related policies in hopes that they reduce risks of complications, improve health, and reduce the use of inappropriate health care services. Recent studies suggest that self-management programs and policies may be serving the needs of wealthier and more educated individuals rather than less fortunate individuals who need it most. To understand the impacts of self-management programs and policies on women living in disadvantaged situations more fully, we propose a pilot study in British Columbia that uses interviews to explore: 1) how women living in difficult situations feel about self-managing their chronic conditions and the kinds of programs they want to improve their health; and 2) how the nature of government environments where decisions are being made impacts self-management policies and programs. We will also collect provincial and regional policy documents and information on who is currently participating in self-management programs in BC. The study findings on the impacts of self-management initiatives on disadvantaged women in BC can be used to develop new policies and programs in Canada that work towards reducing differences in the consequences and outcomes of living with chronic conditions for disadvantaged populations."

The conditions brought on by COVID-19 have increased the possibility of separation, isolation, and reduced social support, as well as education, mental health, and physical health services. Thus, children and families are at heightened risk for trauma reactivation and deteriorating family conditions. Workers are also challenged in their efforts to rapidly change practices to respond to increasing demands and the growing complexity of cases, to ensure the safety and well-being of children and families. Thus, in close consultation with existing and new partners, we will undertake a rapid, month-long knowledge scan, synthesis, and subsequent mobilization initiative related to child welfare and COVID-19, geared to child-serving organizations from across the Canadian Prairies. We will use a variety of mobilization outlets, including an innovative Digital Connections Hub, which will be organized into policy, systems, and best practice responses to meet the mental, physical, and social health needs of children, families and workers. We will focus on the unique needs of Indigenous peoples, females, and others at risk of the compounding effects of COVID-19 on existing inequalities. Through an established infrastructure, affiliation with several research centres, and a well-connected research team, our initiative will contribute significant benefits by providing a forum for access to synthesized, vetted research and accessible resources to increase knowledge and support for child and family services providers. This will in turn improve the physical and mental health and well-being of vulnerable children and families during COVID-19, and beyond."
Barriers and Challenges in Delivering Forensic Services to Mentally Disordered Offenders in Rural British Columbia,"['Milne, Teresa E']",['N/A'],"['Forensic Mental Health', 'Interviews', 'Mental Disorder', 'Northern British Columbia', 'Provincial Court', 'Rural', 'Service Delivery']",17500.0,201600,"The over representation of those those suffering mental disorder in the criminal justice system has been attributed not only to substance use and treatment compliance issues, but also to larger factors such as homelessness and disorganized community services. The influence of the provincial court and forensic mental health systems on the health of those living in northern British Columbia is drastically under-researched.

The Forensic Psychiatric Services Commission is responsible for the operation of six regional community clinics in addition to the main Forensic Psychiatric Hospital in Vancouver. Five of these clinics are located in the lower third of BC. The final clinic, in Prince George, is the closest site for forensic assessment and inpatient treatment for the remaining two thirds of the province. This clinic serves approximately 630,000 square kilometers of British Columbia.

This study uses a grounded theory approach to explore the barriers and challenges in effective delivery of forensic mental health services to rural areas surrounding Prince George. Specifically, this research will examine the following questions: Do northern mental health clinics have the capacity to effectively assess and reintegrate offenders who live in remote communities? Do the policies concerning diversion, best practices, and psychological assessment that are created in urban areas continue to work in rural areas?

Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with staff at the regional clinic, provincial judiciary, local health authorities (a doctor, community counsellor, and local mental health agency) to evaluate the perceived challenges of each service provider in effectively treating those offenders with mental disorder. Themes that emerge during these interviews will be compared to recently suggested best practices for criminal justice diversion to determine their feasibility in rural BC."

Despite lofty claims about the benefits to be reaped through smart city technology, significant questions remain about the actual health impact of these advances, and how these impacts are distributed within the Canadian population. Smart Prevention is our new term to describe how smart city approaches can be applied to chronic disease and injury prevention in cities, and promote health equity. Our project aims to: 1) build on our team's smartphone health intervention work to examine how different local neighbourhood area environmental exposures are linked with health outcomes within diverse populations living in 4 Canadian cities; 2) document and analyze the process of how smart prevention projects engage different stakeholders - industry, municipalities, researchers, community groups, and the broader public - and how smart prevention projects are implemented in different cities; and, 3) to scale up lessons from 1 and 2 to create a web-based dashboard system for city leaders, supporting their real-time operational decisions and strategic planning to improve health outcomes and health equity in Canadian cities. We will do this by assembling our multi-sector, interdisciplinary team of experts to: identify research sites; make context-specific adaptations of our existing smartphone data collection app, and; develop specific research protocol and collaborative research program teams for each city."
Urban environments and youth mental health: examining how adolescent mental health indicators are associated with urban design and cognitive architecture in a mid-sized Ontario city,"['Minaker, Leia']","['Dean, Jennifer', 'Doherty, Sean T', 'Ellard, Colin G']","['Built Environment', 'Cognitive Architecture', 'Healthy Cities', 'Mental Health', 'Planning', 'Youth/Adolescence']",100000.0,442936,"Background: Youth mental illness is a significant and growing societal burden. Urban environments impact youth mental health via natural settings that can aid cognitive and emotional development and built settings that may induce stress. However, existing research uses crude measures, focuses almost entirely on adult samples, and deprioritizes prevention.
Goals: This mixed-methods project will examine relationships between youth mental health indicators and 1) specific urban (built, natural) designs and 2) cognitive architecture principles (concepts linked to mental states) in a mid-sized city. Our research questions are: 1) how do youth understand pedestrian- and transit-oriented designs and cognitive architecture features? 2) what mental health phenomena do youth associate with specific designs? 3) are pedestrian- and transit-oriented designs and cognitive architecture features associated with distinct mental health indicators among youth?, and 4) do observed links vary across demographic subgroups? This research will promote health equity and seek to inform inter-sectoral solutions that support mental health in urban design.
Methods: This project has two phases: 1) Qualitative go-along interviews, where participants (n~40) ages 10-16 will walk with an interviewer along a predetermined route featuring seven distinct natural and built urban settings, viewing particular features, and answering questions regarding their present emotions and moods in each setting. Analysis will use a thematic approach incorporating deductive and inductive coding techniques. And 2) A repeated-measures design, where participants (same age, n~100) will travel the same route, be prompted to view specific visuals and architectural examples, and answer questions on tablets about mental health indicators. Mixed-effects models will be used for quantitative analysis. 
Outcomes: Results will inform urban design practice and policy recommendations in Canada to improve youth mental health."

To date, few studies in Canada has examined where people eat and how eating out is associated with dietary intake and weight outcomes. In 2009/2010, we surveyed a large, population-based sample (n=4102) of residents in Southwestern Ontario on food purchasing and dietary behaviors, reasons for selecting different restaurants, and weight-related outcomes. About 30% of residents reported eating fast food at least once per week, and almost half (49%) ate at a coffee shop. Popular reasons for eating at fast food outlets were: lack of time; convenience; taste. Diet quality and fruit and vegetable consumption were poorer among those who frequently ate fast food, and body mass index and waist circumference was higher in this group as well. Fast food outlets and coffee shops might be particularly relevant for health promotion interventions."

Our team partnered with Statstics Canada to pilot the novel use of the Business Register (BR), a high-quality, central repository of baseline information on all businesses (including retail food outlets) currently in operation in Canada. This database has huge potential for filling research gaps in a number of healthy city topic areas. This project will be the first to use existing microdata from the BR to develop and validate new RFE data, and develop data visualization products for examining Canadian RFE. We will also address critical contextual questions related to scaling up of evidence-based RFE interventions in Canadian cities. We aim to test the validity, sensitivity, positive predictive value, and representativity of Statistics Canada's BR data compared to Google Street View, DMTI Spatial, and Open Street Map. Second, we will develop data visualization products and measures for presenting and comparing Canadian RFEs. Third, we will conduct qualitative interviews with RFE researchers, municipal planners, public health practitioners, and federal and provincial nutrition leads to explore 1) potential applications of the data visualization products for different audiences, and 2) how contextual issues affect product uptake between different knowledge user groups and different geographic jurisdictions and settings (e.g., urban/rural).

Many Canadian regions are directing high-density housing development towards urban growth centres. However, high-rises (high-density housing with at least 5 storeys) are not built for youth. Youth are especially vulnerable to effects of poor housing and neighbourhood characteristics, and are excluded from participating in planning and development decisions. No extant research has investigated youth perspectives on how high-rise neighbourhoods affect their health, and what specific urban designs they suggest as solutions. This is a major gap given that high-rise housing stock will continue to grow to meet demand.

This equity-focused research will support an emergent research focus on youth health and high-rise living. We will: 1) undertake a series of focus groups with youth in Toronto, the Region of Waterloo, and London, Ontario to explore how youth think different urban design features are linked to their physical and mental health and what urban design and placemaking solutions they propose; 2) Engage in participatory mapping exercises in which youth will identify areas in their neighborhoods where they engage in physical and mental health-related behaviors, and 3) Undertake go-along interviews in high-rise neighborhoods to more deeply explore these themes. Participants will be recruited to maximize diversity in terms of gender, race/ethnicity, and type of neighborhood where they live to ensure diverse viewpoints are represented in our sample.

High-rises are unique social and physical environments, and international literature suggests mixed associations between living in high-rises and various health outcomes, including potential negative effects on mental health. Canadian research has been stymied by a lack of national data to identify high-rise residents or locations. Our research will do three things. 1) We will build and validate an open-access dataset of high-rise address locations and postal codes in Canadian urban areas. 2) We will use these data, linked to multiple datasets from the Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research Consortium, to explore the extent to which high-rise areas are associated with environmental conditions linked to health (e.g., local greenness) in those neighbourhoods. 3) We will explore associations between exposure to high-rise living and physical and mental health outcomes, using Canadian Community Health Survey data linked to our high-rise dataset using historical postal codes from respondent tax data. We will produce novel, nation-wide results that can directly inform urban planning policy interventions, high-rise housing policy, and community design guidelines with the purpose of improving urban health and health equity.

'Place' has been increasingly recognized as a public health issue in the last 20 years; however, there is a paucity of literature pertaining to the health contributions of the school environment, and the ability for schools to mitigate the influences of the residential neighbourhood. 

Research Question: This research looks at 1) the social and environmental determinants at the neighbourhood, and school levels that independently affect mental health outcomes in school-aged children; 2) their mediating processes - pathways of effect that can inform areas of intervention. 

Methods: Schools in Toronto will be sampled from strata defined by the concentration of students living below the low-income cut-off. Up to 50 students, aged 8 - 17 will be sampled from each school. Multilevel models predict that individual and contextual factors are inherently interdependent, and will thus be used to analyze the independent influences of health determinants across levels. Children's internalizing symptoms and externalizing behavioural outcomes will be assessed. Both GIS and self-reports will be used to characterize the distribution of built and social features in participants' neighbourhoods. Organizational and compositional determinants at the school-level will be quantified from student/teacher surveys, and school records. Individual-level determinants of mental health and confounders such as age, gender, and family income will be accounted for.

Impact: By elucidating the mechanisms of action for social determinants at the school and other contexts, this research will inform the planning and the delivery of site-specific interventions that address mental health inequities affecting children in urban Canada."

Yet while social inequalities in mental health occurs in all high-income societies, the extent of inequality and its impact on future employment varies substantially. These cross-national differences imply that the children's mental health and their later employment outcomes are not attributable solely to health selection, but are related to the political and economic institutions that define health and labour market entry.

Studies show that exposure to precarious work increases the risk of mental health problems including depression and suicidality. Because women make up a higher percentage of those in precarious work than men in both Canada and the US, the growth of precarious work in these countries has great implications for gender disparities in mental health. 

Few studies have linked the growth of precarious work and its associated gender-inequalities in mental health to the labour market and social policies that shape both how people work and its health effects. Evidence on the gendered experiences of precarious work and mental health for populations who face multiple adversities, such as poverty and substance use disorders, and who are commonly socioeconomically marginalized, is especially lacking.

This research program has two aims: (1) compare the extent that precarious work contributes to gender-based inequalities in mental health in Canada and the US between 2000 and 2018, and (2) examine this relationship from the lived experiences of individuals who are socioeconomically marginalized. Aim 1 will be examined with comparable samples from the US Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the Canadian Community Health Survey. Aim 2 leverages survey and in-depth interview data from three ethno-epidemiological studies of socioeconomically marginalized individuals in Vancouver. Using quantitative, qualitative, and cross-national analyses, this research produces evidence on the gendered distribution of precarious work and its effect on mental health; the modifiable aspects of gender-based inequalities that can be linked to the policies shaping precarious work; and, the mechanisms driving gendered experiences of precarious work and mental health for marginalized individuals."

Water distribution systems are crucial for public health, delivering treated water from treatment plants to consumers. However, these systems often face challenges such as microbial contamination, corrosion, disinfectant byproducts, and physical integrity issues that can degrade water quality.
BC faces challenges, including microbiological quality issues, funding constraints, infrastructure complexities, drought, and regulatory framework issues. These challenges can lead to breaches within water distribution systems, which then impact potable water quality, resulting in external contamination, pathogen growth, and biofilm formation. Heavy metal contamination due to pipe corrosion or accumulation from source water also poses a risk.
There is a lack of consistent provincial guidance among health authorities for assessing and monitoring the integrity of water distribution systems. This project aims to fill this gap by developing guidelines for the BC Ministry of Health, to be used by health authorities in BC. The project will seek to understand the current state of water distribution systems across BC, identify gaps, develop guidance for these gaps, and develop recommendations for inspection processes. The findings may be published if appropriate. This work will contribute to ensuring the safety and quality of BC's water supply."

Post-Ebola recovery plans were put into place centered around strengthening systems-level resiliency to buffer against structural shocks like future pandemics. When COVID-19 hit the country in 2020, this post-Ebola health system strengthening was tested. Our team, a partnership between scientists Sierra Leone and Canada, proposes to examine the wider impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on essential health services in Sierra Leone. First, we will measure the extent to which the COVID-19 epidemic changed the delivery/uptake of essential services and led to negative health outcomes in infectious diseases (HIV, tuberculosis, malaria), childhood vaccination, maternal health. We will compare this wider health impact against that of the Ebola epidemic. Second, we will examine how differences in public health measures and SARS-CoV-2 vaccine coverage over time and geography (districts) influenced service disruption, and the extent to which adaptive service reconfiguration (adaptations and enhancements) may have mitigated the wider health impacts of the COVID pandemic. Results will be used by stakeholders and service providers, including the National COVID-19 Emergency Operations Center and the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation, to inform ongoing program adaptation in the context of future waves of COVID in a region with limited SARS-CoV-2 vaccine supply to date."

Community-based participatory modeling of HIV transmission among men who have sex with men in Kenya,"['Mishra, Sharmistha']","['Lazarus, Lisa', 'Tahmo, Nancy']","['Community-Based', 'Hiv', 'Kenya', 'Men Who Have Sex With Men', 'Participatory Modeling']",19700.0,499688,"Global progress has been made in HIV prevention, yet challenges persist, especially among marginalized populations. Despite a 38% decline in new infections since 2010, an estimated 1.3 million people acquired HIV in 2022, with 51% in Sub-Saharan Africa and heightened risks among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM). Gaps in access to prevention and care persist due to stigma, discrimination and structural violence. With dwindling funding, there is a crucial need for research to identify local HIV risk drivers, leading to tailored programs and resource prioritization.
Mathematical models play a crucial role in guiding global and national responses to the HIV epidemic. Organizations like UNAIDS and Health Ministries use these models to inform policies and interventions. However, developing accurate models requires addressing complex socio-behavioral factors and ensuring community relevance. Traditional models have often labeled individuals based on risk, but we propose a novel approach by considering sexual network typologies among MSM, acknowledging that network-level characteristics influence HIV transmission.
Challenging conventional modeling norms, we aim to move beyond hierarchical research structures and engage community organizations and MSM directly in co-designing a mathematical model. Participatory modeling involves stakeholders in every decision-making step, democratizing knowledge creation. This method not only enhances community ownership and governance but also captures community dynamics and improves model relevance. Our multi-disciplinary team proposes to meet virtually and in person (in Kenya) over a year to solidify the partnership, review existing participatory modeling methods, and co-design a work plan to do this work. Our proposal stems from concerns raised by the MSM HIV Prevention Network in Kenya, reflecting a commitment to community-centered HIV prevention strategies through innovative and inclusive research practices."

Applying effective indicators to promote interdisciplinary knowledge translation in dengue control,"['Mitchell-Foster, Kendra L']",['N/A'],"['Community Health', 'Dengue Virus/Dengue Fever', 'Health Policy', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Mosquito Control', 'Sanitation', 'Vector-Borne Disease', 'Water Management']",105000.0,184674,"Dengue fever (DF) is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease affecting humans with 50-100 million cases annually worldwide, and its prevalence is being aggravated by trends of climate change, urbanization and poverty. Increasingly, DF control efforts are focusing on the links between humans and their biophysical, social and economic environments while incorporating community involvement and interdisciplinarity in interventions. The effectiveness of such approaches in linking involved disciplines and stakeholder bodies (researchers, policy and decision-makers, communities, individuals) remains unexamined.  To evaluate how well evidence is being applied to implement actions and policy to improve people's health, I will apply a four-dimensional Knowledge Translation (KT) model and the Mayan Index (MI), a a tool for measuring DF transmission risk that combines hygiene (refuse management) and mosquito breeding risk (water management) indices, to assess DF transmission risk at the community level. MI scores will be used to initiate and evaluate participatory community interventions based on improved community-level and domestic water and refuse management. Following this data (pre and post-intervention MI scores, impact of intervention(s) on DF transmission risk) through the public health decision-making process will illuminate strengths and weaknesses in KT at the community, local and regional scales. I will use lessons learned from interdisciplinary dengue management projects in Cuba and Ecuador and apply these to the dengue crisis in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Although dengue interventions have been numerous in both Latin America and South East Asia, very rarely do they exchange successful lessons in either field work or policy initiatives. This project will establish an international community of practice (Canada, Bangladesh, Ecuador, Cuba) in DF and water management and new ""East-West"" (Bangladesh/Latin America) partnerships within that community of practice."
Obesity in Canada: Historical and Critical Perspectives,"['Mitchinson, Wendy L']","['Ellison, Jennifer E', 'McPhail, Deborah']","['Diabetes', 'Equity', 'Ethics', 'Gender', 'Health Activism', 'Health History', 'Inuit', 'Nutrition', 'Obesity', 'Obesity Stigma']",20940.0,257781,"In Canada estimated obesity rates have risen over the course of the twentieth century, though the measurement and criteria for being obese have also changed during this time. Particular groups in Canada, notably low income people, are more likely to be labelled obese, and yet newspaper, magazine and television coverage of obesity indicates that fatness and staying slim are the preoccupations of the middle class. In 2003 the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that almost all countries around the world were experiencing an obesity epidemic as a result of increasing industrialization, mechanization and urbanization.  WHO's report legitimized escalating fears that the world's population was growing fatter and provided a focus for more general concerns about normal body weight and shape.

Left out of the dominant ""obesity epidemic"" discourse is a discussion of the implications of naming and targeting the ""obese."" As a result, a critical literature on the obesity epidemic has emerged that asks: How do we measure health? How do our attitudes toward obesity develop? What are the consequences of not measuring up? In recent years scholars in the sciences and social sciences have queried the statistical base on which the concern about obesity resides, challenged the dire health future faced by those who are obese and suggesting that physical fitness is more beneficial and attainable than the goal of reaching an ""ideal"" weight. This critical literature has argued that obesity is a culturally and historically contingent concept, one that is not simply a biological condition but a discursively constructed category. The book emerging from this planning meeting will help to fill gaps in knowledge around the stigma experienced by obese people, particularly those belonging to equity seeking groups and vulnerable populations, in primary and community-based health care."

Preventing people from initiating injection drug use would reduce the burden of overdose mortality and prevent transmission of HIV and other blood-borne infections. However, to-date, few interventions are known prevent injection drug use initiation. Opioid agonist treatments (OAT), including methadone maintenance treatment and buprenorphine/naloxone, have demonstrated range of benefits, including reductions in injection drug use and HIV risk behaviours. Preliminary studies have likewise demonstrated a protective effect of OAT engagement on the provision of injection initiation assistance by people who inject drugs (PWID) to injection-naïve persons. However, gaps in evidence remain related to the feasibility of this approach across various subgroups of PWID. This is an important gap in understanding given the use of OAT modalities for preventing injection initiation may vary in effectiveness across diverse populations. In particular, some PWID experience complex, overlapping forms of social and economic inequities, increasingly recognized as underlying drivers of drug-related harm and barriers to accessing health and social services. This proposed multisite research program aims to a) examine the extent to which groupings of socioeconomic factors shape injection initiation practices in distinct settings, and b) assess OAT's potential role in preventing injection initiation across marginalized subgroups of PWID. It will employ a comparative approach with data from multiple cohorts of PWID based in Toronto, Canada and the binational metropolitan unit of Tijuana, Mexico/San Diego, USA. It is anticipated that the proposed work will provide insight into how effective and adaptable the approach to ""Addiction Treatment as Prevention"" is for preventing injection initiation across diverse settings and populations of PWID, thus mitigating upstream drivers of drug-related health disparities in Canada and abroad."

Many of the city's most disadvantaged people, who struggle with addiction, mental illness, and other health issues, find their home here. In the mid-1990s, high rates of drug injection use and HIV/AIDS led to the declaration of a 'public health emergency'. Thanks to programs and services introduced at this time, much progress has been made -- but new challenges have emerged. People are living longer, but living with many chronic diseases such as HIV, Hepatitis C, diabetes etc. They need to access a range of health and social services, many of which are poorly coordinated with each other. To tackle these new challenges, Vancouver Coastal Health (VCH) has developed the Second Generation Strategy (2GS) for the DTES. Our research will evaluate the implementation and outcomes of this strategy. The research will use a Developmental Evaluation approach, which is suited for complex projects implemented into changing environments, where many different stakeholders are involved. We will produce 'real-time' information that allows for on-going program improvement and the continuous refinement of indicators for success.

The research includes 3 parts. First, managers and service providers will be asked in interviews about their perceptions of service integration, and how different agencies and programs might best work together. Second, we will draw upon existing data to develop and track measures of integration, service use, and outcomes for disadvantaged groups. The third component will consist of developing a priority setting framework drawing on data inputs from the first and second parts of the research in order for VCH decision makers to determine how best to spend the available resources to achieve a successful full roll-out of the 2GS."

Researchers describe the crisis in the US as unfolding across four waves starting in the 1990s. Due to the stigmatized nature of illicit substance use, responses to the crisis from governments and policy makers have not been uniform across US states and counties, contributing to ongoing barriers to the implementation of public health strategies to prevent drug overdose. These dynamics affect, for example, whether governments and policy makers choose to prioritize policing, drug treatment, or harm reduction policies. Each wave of the crisis also coincides with significant political, economic, and social events (e.g., 2008 Economic Recession, and Trump vs. Clinton 2016 Presidential Election). Yet, historical studies of the past thirty years of the drug overdose crisis, including research on the political drivers of overdose fatalities, are scarce. Guided by the ecosocial theory, which offers a framework to study how changing political, social, and economic contexts over time interact to affect people's health, my research will develop measures of key contextual factors of the past thirty years of the drug overdose crisis. Specifically, I will examine contextual factors in the domains of healthcare, public health, criminal justice, politics, and the economy, which ecosocial theory suggests interact to produce varying degrees of overdose risk and harm. My research will further identify when and where clusters of overdose deaths occur in relation to these contextual factors from 1989-2021 across US counties and states, and examine which racial and gender groups are most affected. This research will inform policy and public health efforts by increasing our understanding of how changing politics, social contexts, and economics impact fatal drug overdose risk, and by revealing overdose inequities across geographies and population groups."

Overdose prevention services (OPS), where people can use drugs in an observed setting, have struggled to meet physical distancing rules, and visits to OPS sites have fallen by 35% since COVID-19 began. At the same time as this recent spike in fatal overdoses, more people have been dying from smoking drugs in BC since 2016. Many people think that their risk of having an overdose is lower if they smoke opioids than if they inject, but this is not actually true. Also, it is more difficult for people who smoke drugs to use OPS, because many sites do not allow smoking, or if they do, have smoking areas outside that are hard for staff to monitor. During COVID-19, there has been a greater drop in people coming to OPS to smoke drugs than to use drugs in other ways, in part because OPS are not set up well to meet the needs of people who smoke. 

This study will introduce continuous oxygen monitoring at partnering OPS for people who come to smoke opioids or ""down."" We will train peer researchers at these sites to enroll participants, and to gather information from them. While smoking opioids, participants will attach a wrist monitor that will read and transmit their oxygen levels to iPads available to OPS staff. We will train OPS staff to check on participants if their low oxygen levels trigger an alarm. We will examine whether people who smoke drugs and OPS staff find our continuous oxygen monitoring protocol useful. We will also look at how and when oxygen levels change when people smoke opioids.

We will use our findings to develop harm reduction messaging for people who smoke drugs, to expand monitoring to other OPS and private locations like supportive housing across BC, and to develop oxygen monitoring apps that allow people who use drugs alone to do so more safely."

Immigrants experience profound change in all aspects of their lives, none more so than their food environment.  The ""healthy immigrant effect"", an overall decline in the health of immigrants after living in their host country for some years, is well documented in Canada.  Reasons for the decline are partially attributed to the adoption of the host nation's lifestyle.  Diet change is one of the implicated factors; indeed there is evidence of increased obesity among immigrants, as well as higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.  What is lacking is an understanding of how dietary change among immigrants occurs - does it vary by family, ethnic, age or gender group?  What are the processes by which diet change occurs - are families with school children more influenced by media, schools, and peers?  What are the benefits versus the drawbacks of maintaining a traditional diet in Canada?  Is food insecurity a significant barrier to healthy eating?  An understanding of these processes is important because rather than viewing the deterioration of nutritional health as an inevitable part of migrating to Canada, there may be interventions that could improve immigrant nutritional health.  We propose a landscape analysis of dietary change among immigrants in the City of Hamilton, Ontario.  To this end we will engage in a process of consultation and planning/development with knowledge-users (KUs) including,the YMCA (provides newcomer services in Hamilton), immigrant community leaders, and The Heart and Stroke Foundation.

The World Health Organization estimates that worm infections occur in about 130 countries worldwide and that approximately one billion schoolchildren are at risk of these infections. Infection occurs either by ingesting water, food or other items contaminated with fecal material, or when worm larvae, present in contaminated soil, directly penetrate the skin. Having worms in the gut can impact health in many ways, especially in children. Since worms exist in areas where poverty and malnutrition are highest, children have a double burden. Their growth can be stunted, they are more likely to have anemia, they are absent from school more often and they do not have the opportunity to play like non-infected children. The consequences of worm infections in childhood last a lifetime. There are drugs that can be used to treat worm infections. However, drug programs can be expensive and the effects are only temporary. In order to have a more lasting effect on reducing worm infections, my research proposal aims to study the impact of adding specific information on worm prevention practices in grade schools. In addition, I would like to study if boys and girls use this information in different ways. The study would be conducted in the schools of a poor area of Peru called Belen, where it is known that most schoolchildren are infected with worms. The results of this research would benefit not only Peruvian schoolchildren but all schoolchildren who live in areas where worm infections occur."

Research to evaluate intervention strategies can help decision-makers to identify the type and intensity of control measures needed for containment. We propose to investigate the severity and healthcare resource utilization during potential outbreaks, estimate the transmissibility and the percentage of the population that could be affected, and predict clinical outcomes and critical care demand. We will use modelling and simulation for nearly real-time estimates of public health and healthcare interventions in Canada, the US and India. Our specific research objectives are to:
1) Predict the scope of disease transmission, potential outbreaks, and clinical attack rates.
2) Project what hospitals will require for isolation, ambulatory services, emergency and hospital admissions, and critical care of symptomatic patients.
3) Assess the potential effects of various non-pharmacologic interventions, including quarantine, self-reporting and isolation, and school closure.
4) Evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a COVID-19 vaccine and determine best scenarios to distribute a vaccine based on population age and risk of disease severity.
To achieve these objectives, we will develop new and adapt existing mathematical models to simulate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in outbreak scenarios. Our team has access to a number of databases including daily reports on incidence of confirmed and suspected cases, hospitalization, and deaths attributed to COVID-19 in China. Using demographics of the Canadian, US, and Indian populations, we will evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination strategies, hospital surge capacity, and social policies such as quarantine and closing schools."

Predicting risk of osteoradionecrosis of the jaw in head and neck cancer patients using machine learning approaches,"['Moharrami, Mohammad']",['N/A'],"['Artificial Intellegnce', 'Head And Neck Cancer', 'Machine Learning', 'Osteoradionecrosis Of The Jaw', 'Predictive Modeling', 'Risk Assessment']",105000.0,475629,"About 5-15% of head and neck cancer patients who undergo radiotherapy develop a serious condition called ""osteoradionecrosis of the jaw"" marked by exposed bone in upper and lower jaws that do not heal after a period of three months. These bones get infected and painful, and eventually die and must be removed. To date, many of the risk factors associated with this condition such as radiation dose, tumor location, smoking habit, oral health, and dental extractions have been identified. However, a comprehensive tool is not yet available to screen and predict the risk of bone death after radiotherapy for each individual/group. One solution to address this shortcoming is to implement novel statistical methods such as machine learning, which can improve our estimation and help to more accurately calculate personalized risk and severity of bone death. In this study, we aim to use data from Princess Margaret Cancer Center to develop a risk assessment tool tailored specifically for the Canadian population. Having such a tool, we can modify treatment before radiotherapy to minimize the risk of bone death. For example, the radiation dose can be adjusted and extractions can be provided beforehand. After radiotherapy, knowing the risk of bone death, oral health care practitioners can also modify their treatment accordingly to refrain from invasive treatments and provide necessary hygiene education to high-risk individuals. Also, by having an accurate risk assessment tool, patients will be better informed about the risks of radiotherapy and can choose accordingly from their available treatment options."

However, despite their availability, many older adults decide to either never acquire such technologies, or abandon them shortly after purchase. Although addressed sparingly within the literature, some research suggests that the preservation of 'self-image' is an important factor in this decision-making process. As such, this critical ethnographic study, theoretically framed by identity theory and critical gerontology, will explore how the decision-making processes of older adults with ARVL, as it relates to technology adoption, is influenced by the negotiation of identity. Two novel methods will be used to accomplish this goal. The first method will involve a video-recorded home technology tour, which focuses on learning how older adults with ARVL make decisions to use technology within the private sphere of the home. The second method will involve accompanying participants in their local environments with an audio recorder, using the 'go-along' method, in order to better understand how technologies are used in public spaces, how older adults decide to use technology, which occupations are supported by technology use, and what challenges are encountered in the absence of technology use. This study will make important methodological contributions by combining innovative research methods that aim to understand technology adoption patterns in both private and public spheres, while also placing senior's decision-making processes within the broader social context."

While existing evidence has been comprehensively assessed and analysed in our recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses, the extent of measured social equity parameters were extremely heterogeneous, precluding definitive conclusions concerning the course and prognostic factors of cognitive function after TBI. Longitudinal studies are costly and difficult to conduct, however, analysis of the data acquired over years of longitudinal research in TBI, if transformed into a data repository that is formatted for analysis, can provide important insight and a foundation for future scientific exploration on brain injury and brain health, and can help generate countermeasures for brain injury. This proposal addresses the need for continuous curation and uptake of longitudinal TBI data on the nature and course of cognitive changes. We propose development of protocols to organize data from our existing systematic review and new data published since the systematic review was completed to serve as a comprehensive source of evidence on brain injury-induced changes, taking into account any social equity parameters studied. On completion of the analysis, the findings will inform knowledge mobilization activities with the ultimate goal of advancing brain injury and brain health scientific and practice agendas."

Who supports these vulnerable and marginalized populations as their health is getting worse and they are approaching the end-of-life? Studies I have coordinated found that people who are vulnerable are cared for by many people that we would not traditionally think of as caregivers. These included people like ""street family"" rather than people's biological family. But there is little description of who these ""street family"" caregivers are, what they do, how caregiving affects them, and what supports they might need. As part of a larger study working with inner city palliative care teams in three Canadian cities to examine who ""family"" is in this context, I will focus on ""street family"" to understand what they do in relation to their roles. With these caregivers' consent, I plan to observe them in their community settings and interview them. I will explore what influences their capacity to give care and document what impact caregiving has on them. My goal is to provide a detailed description so that we can figure out how to best provide supports to them in order to reduce negative health outcomes including emotional distress, trauma, grief and burnout."

Early intervention and support is needed to reduce the risk and impact of PTSI. Mobile technology such as a smartphone app, coupled with online peer support, is a promising approach to early intervention due to potential for increased accessibility (less barriers due to geography or scheduling), timely access to support and the opportunity to customize to the needs of groups of users. Active engagement of service users throughout the development process is needed to ensure the product is relevant and responsive to their unique needs.
This project will bring together researchers, Ontario PSP (""end-users""), and representatives from their professional associations, unions, health and safety providers, and mental health service providers (""stakeholders"") to co-design, implement and test a mobile app designed to provide information and links to support to PSP who may be at risk for PTSI.

A major challenge for long-term well-being is the transition from pediatric to adult healthcare, which means adapting to a change in medical team, system and resources. Lack of transition preparation often leads to poor medical follow-up. Thus, preparing pediatric patients for this transition is an important goal. Typically, « transition readiness » skills refer to autonomy related managing medication, keeping appointments, keeping track of health issues, interacting with healthcare providers, and managing daily activities. A Transition Readiness Assessment Questionnaire (TRAQ) is available to assess transition readiness skills but is underused in routine clinical care. 
This project proposes to study the integration and impact of transition readiness screening using the TRAQ in routine care for pediatric cancer survivors at CHU Sainte-Justine, the largest pediatric oncology center in Québec. We will be consulting pediatric cancer survivors, their caregivers, and healthcare professionals at each step of the TRAQ integration process. They will help determine the best way to integrate TRAQ during yearly medical follow-ups and will also be consulted to identify and solve difficulties with its integration. Following TRAQ, transition resources will be offered for the pediatric cancer survivor. The project will evaluate if integrating TRAQ in routine care leads to greater transition readiness, satisfaction with transition care, and awareness of resources for their transition.
Results of this project will help create a manual, that will facilitate the integration of TRAQ and improve transition readiness in other sites across Canada. Since better transition readiness influences adult treatment adherence, we expect this project to reduce the morbidity and the death of pediatric cancer survivors."
"""When you follow your heart, you provide that path for others"": Indigenous Models of Youth HIV Leadership","['Monchalin, Renee J']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2500.0,324340,"In recognizing the potential for the critical consciousness raising, resistance and resilience of young leaders in the HIV/AIDS movement, we examine how a group of Indigenous youth leaders take up the notion of leadership in the context of HIV prevention.

Taking Action II is an Indigenous community based participatory action research project. Eighteen Indigenous youth leaders (including myself) were invited from across Canada to share their narratives about their passion for HIV prevention through digital storytelling. One-on-one semi-structured interviews were conducted with youth leaders after they developed their digital stories, and then again several months later.

The youth told stories about the reasons for their passion for HIV prevention, leadership, activism, and engagement. Importantly, the youth had alternative definitions of leadership that moved away from mainstream ideas of power, status, and individualism.

In contrast to dominant mainstream ideals, Indigenous youth have different ways of thinking about leadership that are linked to relationships with their families, communities, histories, legacies and health. Cultivating and supporting Indigenous youth leaders is an important part of the solution to tackling the devastating HIV statistics and making positive change within our communities."

As a result, we lack a specific profile of data on Métis Communities. In order to respond to the HIV/AIDs epidemic, creativity is needed to respectfully engage all of our Peoples, and adopting a pan-Aboriginal approach may obscure important cultural differences. 

This proposed research will be nested in the national Sexy Health Carnival (SHC). The SHC is a series of interactive booths and fun educational games that were created by and for Aboriginal youth.

To improve the health status of Indigenous peoples, embracing effective approaches to health promotion requires decolonizing practices. Decolonization does not mean a complete rejection of all Western knowledge. Rather, it is about centering Indigenous concerns and worldviews within a health promotion context. This presentation is based on a peer-led, community-based action research project by and for Indigenous youth on the pow-wow trail in southern Ontario. The research illustrates how moving away from conventional public health approaches and towards a decolonizing approach can empower Indigenous people, and improve Indigenous peoples' health outcomes. Quantitative data was collected using an offline iPad survey administered to 154 Indigenous youth in southern Ontario aged 16 to 25. The aim of the survey was to quantitatively test the feasibility and cultural appropriateness of an Indigenous youth lead, sexual health promotion intervention in powwow settings, and evaluate the appropriateness of the strategy. The survey responses were exported to SPSS for statistical analysis, including examining means, frequencies, and standard deviations.  This project provides preliminary evidence that supports decolonizing public health approaches that encompass Indigenous ways of knowing and doing, implemented by and for Indigenous peoples in a local context. By acknowledging colonization, this presentation demonstrates why and how moving away from a conventional public health approach can improve Indigenous peoples' health. Decolonizing health promotion that is centered around Indigenous ways of knowing, can transform understandings and outcomes of Indigenous peoples' health and wellbeing in Canada, and internationally."

These gaps are problematic given the severe disparities in health determinants and outcomes that Métis Peoples experience compared to non-Indigenous Canadians. 

To address the Métis health service gap, this research will engage with the original Métis community health experts, Métis women. Traditionally, Métis women were central to the health and well-being of their communities. However, due to decades of colonial legislation and forced land displacement, female voices have been silenced, and Métis identities have been fractured. This fracture has had direct implications on the health of Métis People, and what health services they feel safe accessing.

Guided by a Decolonizing Praxis, this research will follow an Indigenous methodology centered around storytelling to engage urban Métis women in the Western provinces. Through a combination of conversations and sharing circles, this research will explore the question: How do the ways in which urban Métis women experience and conceptualize health services reflect their cultural identity(ies)? 

Transcripts will be coded, undergo an ethical review process, and a thematic analysis will be conducted. The results will be translated through: 1) Articles for peer reviewed publication; 2) Presentations in community/ academic conferences; 3) A co-developed dissemination strategy for the Métis communities; 4) Fact Sheets for urban health service providers; and 5) An urban Métis community feast in each city to honor the women and their stories."

Beginning in 2008 a group of HIV positive Canadian women and girls participated in a study and were given the HPV vaccine. These women were followed over time to understand if the vaccine provided a similar level of protection as in HIV negative women and girls. 
Preliminary information from this group suggests the vaccine is safe for use in HIV positive women and girls. In this HIV positive group almost 100% responded to the vaccine but protection levels were not as high as in HIV negative women and girls and the immune levels of protection began to decrease more rapidly in a shorter period of time. New infections of the HPV types in the vaccine were also seen in this group, this information could be key in understanding the critical levels needed to protect against infection.  
The ability to follow this group over a longer period of time will provide a better understanding of what factors affect the immune protection of HIV positive women and girls, and if the immune levels of protection will be significantly lower than HIV negative women and girls.

Though it affects about 9.2% of Canadians, there is very little current Canadian data on PTSD. PTSD is notoriously difficult to treat and its persistence has been related in part to poor coping strategies.There is virtually no literature looking at the daily stressors and coping strategies used by PTSD patients who fail to remit compared to those who remit.

This is a longitudinal study to investigate the nature of daily stressors and coping mechanisms in a random sample of 2,433 of individuals taken from a large Epidemiological Catchment Area (ECA) study. Additionally, the candidate will use her previous training in qualitative research to further explore daily stress and coping methods from the subjective perspective of individuals with current or past PTSD. We hypothesize that at wave 2, wave 1 participants with PTSD who use less avoidant emotional coping strategies will improve more (ie. have less PTSD symptoms) than those who are more prone to avoidant emotional coping. Additionally, qualitative content analysis from in-depth interviews will provide a clearer descriptive summary of the latent content of participants' views surrounding coping strategies. 

Trauma exposure, and PTSD diagnosis will be assessed with use the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS 1.2): Military Supplemen7. The CCHS 1.2: Stress and Coping Section will evaluate sources and frequency of stress, along with stress management abilities. Qualitative data will be collected using semi-structured interviews examining experiences related to stress and coping from the perspectives of the individuals. 

Successful completion of the proposed research will provide much needed Canadian based psychiatric epidemiological data. It also has the potential to suggest innovative and feasible strategies to improve current methods of PTSD treatment avenues thus leading to improved quality of life for those burdened by PTSD."

Within Canada problem gambling affects 2.5% of individuals over the course of their life and the devastating consequences extend to friends, family, coworkers and communities. Gambling participation and problems are not equally distributed. Society's most socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals consistently gamble a higher proportion of their income, and assume a disproportionate amount of the associated burden. Opportunities to gamble are also more prevalent and accessible in lower-income communities. Although many studies have demonstrated that the social environment and level of deprivation are known predictors of addictive behaviors, gambling research has continued to focus heavily on the individual. This research project aims to understand how social and environmental deprivation, from the individual to the neighborhoods where they reside, factors into gambling behavior and related harm. Specifically, this research will: (1) integrate public health perspectives and complexity theory to posit how individual and environmental levels of deprivation interact to influence gambling behavior, and (2) validate these theoretical concepts using unique provincial, national and international datasets and advanced statistical methods. My postdoctoral fellowship is oriented toward both knowledge creation and action. I plan to share my findings with as many researchers, students, practitioners and community members as possible. This work is important as it will raise awareness of the existence and extent of gambling related issues within Canadian society and their excessive concentration among vulnerable populations and places. It will provide practical advice and recommendations to be presented directly to key public policy makers to better inform and improve existing problem gambling prevention strategies."

Amorcée et guidée par le milieu communautaire, cette démarche est nourrie par des sessions d'information organisées dans cinq régions du Québec et des produits de diffusion des connaissances (fiches pratiques). D'une part, les activités prévues correspondent à un modèle de diffusion des connaissances qui part du terrain et qui s'appuie sur des pratiques éprouvées par le milieu communautaire en matière d'utilisation des données probantes. Elles seront donc adaptées culturellement et linguistiquement à la réalité de nos communautés. D'autre part, la stratégie de mobilisation adoptée vise à améliorer la concertation de différents partenaires pour élaborer de meilleures réponses au problème de l'insécurité alimentaire. À l'échelle locale, nos activités de dissémination permettront de renforcer les capacités de la communauté à lutter contre l'insécurité alimentaire des personnes vivant avec le VIH.

Assessing Time-Varying Drug Exposures in the Canadian Co-infection Cohort: Methodological Tools to Address Missing Data and Measurement Error,"['Moodie, Erica E']","['Hanley, James A', 'Klein, Marina B', 'Stephens, David A']","['Biostatistics', 'Causal Inference', 'Epidemiology', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hiv', 'Methodology']",263950.0,279414,"Epidemiologic studies typically aim to estimate the true (causal) effect of an exposure such as medication or treatment on outcome, and cohort studies are often seen as an ideal way to investigate a range of outcomes - particularly time-to-event outcomes - due to the prospective nature of the follow-up. However, methodological challenges can arise in cohort studies where participants are recruited after disease onset, and so participants may have been exposed to risk factors of interest prior to cohort entry. It is also sometimes the case that affected individuals who experience an outcome of interest such as death may not survive long enough to enter the cohort, and that the time of cohort entry is not a clinically meaningful time origin. Furthermore, it is often the case that exposures of interest are not randomized, but rather their receipt is controlled by cohort participants and therefore the exposure level may be confounded by participant characteristics such as general level of health, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle or behavioural choices. Hence estimates from analyses of the response modeled as a function of received treatment based on the observed data only are often prone to bias. 

Our projects are aimed at developing new methodological tools that will simultaneously address the three challenges noted above, thereby eliminating bias due to (i) cohort entry after both disease onset and after receipt of the exposure of interest, (ii) the non-random nature of the exposure, and (iii) measurement error so as to study questions of treatment and behavioural risk factors in an HIV-Hepatitis C co-infected population. In particular, we will investigate the effects of anti-retroviral treatment interruptions, illegal drug use, and alcohol consumption on liver fibrosis and end-stage liver disease."

This is because individual patients may respond differently to the same treatment due to their unique combinations of factors such as pre-existing health conditions, genetics, environmental factors, and lifestyle choices. Moreover, a patient may respond differently to the same treatment over time, e.g. as he/she ages. These two types of variability (between individuals and within a single individual over time) motivate the need for targeted treatment plans in which patient care is improved by using information on an individual's changing health status to adapt treatment recommendations accordingly. Examples include the management of chronic conditions, treatments that require frequent adjustments, or clinical decisions based on events such as remissions or intolerable side effects of a drug therapy. This approach, known as precision medicine, relies on ""adaptive treatment strategies"" where treatment plans account for between and within individual differences over time. The goal is to help physicians deliver the best treatment for each patient each time a treatment decision is made. These strategies provide answers to questions like ""If a patient has not responded to an antidepressant, should the dose of that drug be increased, or should a new drug be prescribed?"" While the concept of adaptive treatment strategies has existed for more than 2 decades,  new statistical methods and tools are needed to gain maximum insight from contemporary ""big data"" datasets and to accommodate new treatments that have been developed . My research goals for the next 7 years are to advance statistical theory and develop the needed methods and tools for answering clinically relevant questions related to HIV and mental health."

The Gathering will be a forum for researchers (including those of Aboriginal descent) and Aboriginal community members to exchange information on past and current research and identify strategies and partnerships in order to plan for future research. The outcome of the Gathering will be documented in a report for dissemination to participants and the public, including a Declaration of Guiding Principles for research that achieves outcomes that have a lasting, positive impact on the health of Aboriginal Peoples and their communities. The Gathering will be combined with the International conference on Community Engaged Medical Education in the North (hosted by NOSM and Flinders University, Australia) and the Northern Health Research Conference (hosted by NOSM).

According to the Ontario Human Right Commission, racialized people are non-white and face oppression. The pediatric health care system is one institution that has failed to address the needs of racialized children/youth with disabilities and their parents (RCYDP). Although the  evidence demonstrates that RCYDP face health barriers, to date, qualitative researchers have not investigated the health care experiences of RCYDP as they navigate the Canadian health care system. The existing literature has failed to engage health providers and the health policy landscape as well. We will conduct a two-phase qualitative study to address these critical gaps. Our study will be informed by conceptual theories that de-centre whiteness and be guided by the institutional ethnography methodology. In Phase 1, we will conduct a policy analysis of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) documents across all children's hospitals in Canada to facilitate a better understanding of how these spaces produce diversity knowledge. In Phase 2 (empirical), we will undertake qualitative interviews and an arts-based method known as poetry with 18 RCYDP child-parent dyads to understand their experiences navigating the health care system. We will also conduct 12 qualitative interviews with health care workers to investigate their experiences interacting with RCYDP in clinical settings. Our final subsample will consist of 12 interviews with health policy makers to gain understanding of how health leaders view EDI. In addition to producing knowledge products such as digital reports, a poetry gallery, and workshops, our high risk study will enhance the health of RCYDP and the health care system by generating new knowledge on the experiences of these marginalized patients and parents through the arts."

We propose an intervention called that will involve; a. weekly health education sessions focused on a healthy diet, physical activity, and the importance of regular screening; b. practical sessions on physical activity; and c. demonstration community and/ or kitchen gardens. These will be implemented by community health workers, also known as Village Health Teams. The study will involve several phases beginning with the input from key stakeholders to adapt the intervention to the Ugandan context, then baseline surveys, process evaluation and post - intervention survey
The primary outcomes will be acceptability, feasibility and uptake of the intervention.  Secondary outcomes will examine the effectiveness of the intervention in terms of changes in diet and biomedical outcomes such as blood pressures, weight and waist circumference.

"The role of humoral immunity in the acquisition, transmission, and clearance of human papillomavirus infection in heterosexual couples","['Morais, Samantha']",['N/A'],"['Cancer Epidemiology', 'Cancer Prevention', 'Cervical Cancer', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Cohort Study', 'Hpv Vaccines', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Humoral Immunity', 'Sexually Transmitted Infections']",135000.0,459558,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection. Most HPV infections are asymptomatic and clear spontaneously, while some persist and may result in anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers. Despite screening and HPV vaccination programs, high-risk HPV types account for over 5% of the worldwide cancer burden, highlighting the need for improvements in HPV prevention. Since most HPV infections clear on their own, the immune system likely plays an important role in preventing/clearing infections. The immune system produces HPV antibodies after natural infection or vaccination. Many questions remain however unanswered: 1) what triggers the immune system against specific HPV types, 2) how the immune system can prevent/clear infections, and 3) how an immune response affects HPV transmission between sexual partners. Whether HPV antibodies predict persistent infections and/or future cancer risk in an individual or are merely a result of past infections is also disputed. Understanding these issues may aid in developing new prevention strategies against HPV-related cancers. Moreover, as individuals become increasingly aware of their HPV status through HPV-DNA testing, they may want to know about the consequences of being infected by a virus that can cause cancer. Hence, this project will analyze data from a cohort study (2005-2014) of over 500 young, newly formed heterosexual couples. Longitudinal data on demographic characteristics, sexual behaviour, and medical history including HPV vaccination were obtained. Biological specimens (genital, blood, oral and hand) were collected and tested for HPV infections. Using these data, this project will describe patterns of HPV seropositivity (i.e., circulating HPV antibodies in blood serum) overtime, and identify factors associated with HPV prevalence, persistence and viral load at various anatomical sites. Therefore, this study will enable an in-depth investigation into the immune response to HPV infection."

The Connect Parent Group program is an attachment based intervention with demonstrated effectiveness that has been developed and evaluated in communities across British Columbia; however uptake has been more gradual among Aboriginal caregivers. Over the last 18 months, in collaboration with our partners in Aboriginal communities, we have held a series of focus groups and interviews with service providers, program facilitators, community leaders and caregivers living on-reserve and found that there was universal interest among those with whom we spoke to co-create an adapted version of the Connect program that would: strengthen attachment between caregivers and teens; honour the inherent strengths of Aboriginal caregivers; and respect traditional teachings related to parenting. This project of adaptation, implementation and evaluation of the Connect program for Aboriginal caregivers will move forward through four developmental phases. First, we will establish a Reflecting Team consisting of Aboriginal service providers, community members and leaders who will guide the process of adapting the program. Next we will work with the Reflecting Team to identify adaptations to the program and appropriate measures for evaluating the program that honour both Indigenous and Western ways of knowing. In phase three we will pilot the adapted program in at least six diverse Aboriginal communities representing urban and rural settings as well as on- and off-reserve communities. Finally, we will work with communities to identify barriers to program uptake and produce a detailed implementation plan that will support the future scale-up of the intervention in diverse Aboriginal communities."

Physical aggression, social aggression (aggressive acts that harm social relationships, humiliate or demean others) and violence increase for girls and boys when they enter adolescence, peak in mid-adolescence and decline in adulthood. Victimization also rises for girls and boys. The social and economic burden of adolescent violence and aggression is extremely high. New prevention approaches are needed to support young adolescents at this critical turning point. Building on our 8 year longitudinal study of adolescent girls and boys at high risk for violence and aggression, we evaluate the efficacy of an attachment based program for vulnerable girls and boys just prior to their transition to secondary school, when problems tend to escalate. In this study, we examine how sex and gender intersect with social, psychological, genetic, and biological factors to determine intervention outcomes. The proposed research also explores sex and gender in relation to cultural diversity, violence and victimization, and takes steps to better understand the needs of girls and boys in the juvenile justice system."

Despite recent progress, further research is needed to develop interventions for pre-teens and adolescents, particularly those at the highest level of risk. Few programs have addressed the relevance of gender differences in risk and protective factors, and important questions remain regarding the need for 'gender sensitive', 'gender tailored' or 'gender specific' programming. To be effective interventions must be research driven; based on established knowledge about risk and protective factors; and targeted to sensitive developmental transitions which present different risks for girls and boys. Programs that promote and strengthen relationships between youth and their parents offer considerable promise in enhancing healthy development, and reducing violence, aggression and related mental health and social problems. Building on our eight-year longitudinal study of adolescent girls and boys at high risk for violence, aggression, and poor social and mental health, we developed an attachment focused intervention designed to strengthen parent-teen relationships. The proposed research evaluates the short and long term effectiveness of this program for girls and boys; examines the role of risk and protective factors as determining treatment outcomes; and investigates shared and gender specific social, psychological, genetic and biological factors that underlie change in therapy."
Natural history and treatment of insomnia,"['Morin, Charles M']","['Mérette, Chantal', 'Savard, Josée']","['Burden', 'Comorbidity', 'Epidemiology', 'Incidence', 'Insomnia', 'Longitudinal', 'Natural History', 'Remission', 'Risk Factors']",908604.0,224673,"Insomnia is a very frequent health complaint in the general population and among patients with medical and psychiatric conditions. Chronic difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep are often associated with significant psychosocial and occupational impairments such as daytime fatigue, mood disturbances, performance impairments, more frequent absences from work, and reduced quality of life. The financial costs associated with having insomnia is also very elevated, both at the individual and societal levels. For many individuals, this problem occurs nightly and can last for many years. Yet, only a small percentage of individuals with insomnia seek professional advice and treatment for their difficulties. The reasons for this remain unknown and, although many factors associated with insomnia have been identified, little is known about its causes or about the factors associated with its persistence or remission. Moreover, although chronic insomnia has been linked to psychological and physical health problems, such as depression and hypertension, for example, the long-term consequences of chronic insomnia are still poorly understood. What are the risk factors for developing insomnia? How long does it last if it remains untreated? What are the factors associated with its remission? What are some of the reasons which motivate help-seeking? These are some of the questions this longitudinal study will examine by monitoring the sleep patterns and the psychological and health characteristics of nearly 4000 adults over a 10-year period. This study is likely to yield new information to improve our understanding of the natural course, risk factors, and consequences of insomnia, which may lead to the development of more effective intervention and prevention programs for this important public health problem."

Research shows that physical or sexual abuse in childhood is a risk factor for self-harm later in life. The experience or witnessing of ongoing sexual and physical violence can predispose individuals to substance abuse, low self-esteem, mental and physical health issues, and to themselves becoming perpetrators of violence. 

Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada is the national organization representing Inuit women in Canada. Pauktuutit chose Inuit youth, violence and health as a research priority, with a view to use the research results to create a health promotion outreach campaign to Inuit youth on this issue. The project is guided by an Inuit advisory team from beginning to end. This means Inuit organizations, elders and youth will have substantial input into the research plan, research instruments, recruitment of participants, interview techniques, analysis and dissemination of results, and the use of the results in designing a health promotion outreach campaign. Forty male and female Inuit in Ottawa between the ages of 18 and 21 will be interviewed to document past experience of violence; health and other effects of violence; family history; awareness of messages about violence; social networks; awareness of help available; experience of help available; coping mechanisms for experiencing and witnessing violence; use of social media; and ideas about what kinds of social media messages could get positive messages to Inuit youth, specifically about ending violence and seeking help for violence. Sex and gender differences in responses will be noted and this information used in designing different social media strategies to reach females and males if necessary."

Evaluating Syndromic Surveillance in Public Health Practice: Detecting Waterborne Disease Outbreaks,"['Morrison, Kathryn T']",['N/A'],"['Biostatistics', 'Disease Surveillance', 'Gastrointestinal Diseases', 'Geographic Information Systems', 'Infectious Disease']",105000.0,257510,"Large waterborne disease outbreaks occur regularly in Canada and other countries, resulting in considerable morbidity, mortality, and cost. Public health surveillance is critical to detect outbreaks when water treatment fails. If outbreaks are detected rapidly, interventions, such as boil-water advisories, are available to quickly and effectively limit the human and economic impacts. Traditional public health surveillance systems, however, frequently fail to detect waterborne disease outbreaks. For example, in the E.coli outbreak in Walkerton, 2000 and the Cryptosporidiosis in North Battleford, 2001, existing surveillance systems failed with tragic consequences - thousands of infections, multiple deaths, and enormous economic cost. Syndromic surveillance may address limitations of traditional surveillance by using novel data sources (e.g., emergency department records) and information technology to detect disease cases rapidly and identify outbreaks early in their course. We propose to evaluate empirically the effect of adding syndromic surveillance to existing public health surveillance systems in Canada on the detection and management of waterborne enteric disease outbreaks. We will investigate a variety of types of outbreaks based on population characteristics (e.g., immune-compromised status) and outbreak characteristics (e.g., severity of contamination). We will build and evaluate a model to simulate waterborne outbreaks of gastrointestinal disease (Cryptosporidium, Campylobacter) in Montreal, Quebec, by generating healthcare utilization and laboratory testing data that would result from an outbreak.  The model will be parameterized to simulate infection, the progression of the disease, and the subsequent utilization of healthcare services. We hypothesize that the addition of syndromic surveillance will improve the accuracy and timeliness of outbreak detection and decrease morbidity, mortality, and cost."

Most newborn deaths occurred in South Asia and over 280,000 newborns died in only two South Asian countries, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Multiple factors contribute to this high number of deaths including high rates of home delivery, poor access to health care, and unhygienic and sometimes harmful birthing practices. To improve newborn survival, products and education that are known to reduce the most common causes of newborn death must be made widely available. We recently conducted a study in rural Pakistan, where we aimed to determine whether delivering a newborn care kit (NCK), and educating pregnant women and their families about its use, through community health workers (CHWs) improved newborn survival compared to the country's standard of care. The NCK contained a clean birth kit to reduce maternal and newborn infection; chlorhexidine solution to sterilize the umbilical cord stump and reduce the risk of infection; sunflower oil to massage over the baby's skin to lower the risk of infection and hypothermia; a ThermoSpot sticker to monitor newborn temperature and notify caregivers if the baby was too hot or too cold; and a blanket and reusable heater to warm babies that were too cold. CHWs were also provided with a scale to identify low birth weight babies. Among caregivers who used the kit properly, newborn mortality was 75% lower in the NCK group compared to the control group. Our next step is to make the NCK available to all pregnant women within 3 regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan. We also aim to improve the ability of caregivers to follow instructions on how best to use the NCK. Before this research can be implemented, the Canadian research team must travel to Pakistan and Afghanistan to meet with stakeholders and research partners to finalize the implementation plan. This work has the potential to dramatically improve newborn health in rural low-income settings."

In this research we will compare the impact of two community-based interventions in an effort to identify 'best practices' for preventing falls to young children (1-4 years) in the home. Drawing on findings from systematic reviews on effective child-injury prevention approaches,one intervention approach focuses on social marketing using the media and the other adds two additional components that more directly target parent behaviors relevant to fall prevention in the home. Comparing pre-intervention with post-intervention incidence of falls will reveal the relative success of each intervention approach. In addition, we will assess for changes in parents' awareness of fall injuries, knowledge of fall risks, attitudes towards prevention, and fall-prevention practices to determine which are the key factors that predict any resulting reduction in the incidence of falls. The findings from this research will provide important information on ways that communities can take action to prevent falls in the home to young children."

This research will increase knowledge for understanding and preventing unintentional injuries in school-age children (7-12 years of age). Because many injuries in this age range occur when with peers and unsupervised by adults, the research explores how different types of peer communications influence children's risk taking decisions (i.e., engaging in behaviors that elevate risk of injury when there are alternative behaviors that do not do so), and if these influences vary with child attributes (i.e., age, sex, personality traits, immediate mood state). The findings will allow us to determine if personality attributes make certain children more susceptible to peer influence than others, particularly when in an aroused positive mood state."

In addition, research has been limited by the challenge of how to accurately measure child pedestrian behaviors in realistic traffic conditions without elevating children's risk of injury. The proposed research brings together an interdisciplinary team of established researchers to address these gaps and challenges in creative and innovative ways. The general aim of the proposed research is to apply a population-health framework to advance our understanding of individual (age, gender, cognitive abilities) x contextual factors (traffic and built environment characteristics) that interact to influence elementary-school children's risk of pedestrian injury, using a novel Virtual Reality (VR) laboratory-based testing approach that affords complete control over traffic and environmental conditions while maximizing ecological validity by measuring children's actual crossing behaviors (e.g., evasive actions taken) in 3-D immersive simulated traffic environments. Results will then be used to evaluate the relative impact of different intervention approaches in the VR context (e.g., training child behaviour, modifying environmental risks) on children's safe crossing behaviours, with the goal being to identify those having the most merit; a formal RCT application can then be submitted to fully evaluate these alternative interventions and identify 'best practices' for preventing child pedestrian injuries."

Although there is extensive knowledge about parent practices that  enhance the safety of young children, for school-age children we know relatively little about what parents do, what factors impact these practices, how children react to these practices, and which practices are effective in promoting children's safety. The proposed longitudinal research addresses these gaps and will extend our understanding of parenting practices relevant to safety for children 8 - 12 years of age. This is a developmental stage in which children are typically granted increasing autonomy (i.e., allowed more time alone without adult accompaniment and more independence in decision making). During middle childhood, safety also increases in saliency for parents as they try to balance granting greater independence with maintaining their child's safety. The general objectives of this research are: (1) to identify child and parent factors that influence three safety-promotion strategies commonly used by parents of school-age children (supervision, safety rules, and moderating child autonomy); and (2) to evaluate how these parenting strategies impact children's safety (risk taking, compliance with safety rules, and injuries) over time so 'best practices' in parenting for child safety during middle childhood can be identified. Recruiting a community sample of elementary-school children and their primary caregiver we will complete assessments at multiple points over time. Applying a multi-method approach, a variety of data-gathering techniques (e.g., standardized questionnaires, diary recordings) will be used to ensure ecological validity and reliability of the conclusions. Sophisticated statistical modeling techniques will ensure the analytic approach fully capitalizes on the richness of data provided by using a longitudinal design."

For elementary-school children, motor vehicle pedestrian injury is the key issue.

Also, research has been limited by the challenge of how to measure children's crossing behaviors in traffic without elevating risk of injury. This research will address these issues in an innovative way -- using a Virtual Reality pedestrian environment to study how children cross streets in highly realistic traffic conditions that can be completely controlled. The overall goals are to determine: (1) how individual-difference attributes interact with contextual factors (built environment features, traffic conditions) to influence children's risk of injury when crossing streets and (2) if these relations differ by child sex or age group (e.g., Can attention differences explain why boys and younger children are at highest risk for pedestrian injuries?). The knowledge gained from this research can inform: city planning about traffic flow and road design; school policies about crossing guards and guidelines about safe school routes; guidelines for parents about children's readiness to cross unsupervised; and the development of behavioral training systems to teach children safer crossing skills."

In fact, estimates show a growth rate exceeding that of any other sport and reaching 166% yearly. With increasing growth of the sport, there has been a dramatic increase in the popularity of skateparks (SP). Municipalities are building SP to move skateboarders away from traffic, to motivate more outdoor play activities in an effort to improve health, and in response to demands from youth and parents for safe-play resources for skateboarders. Unfortunately, the increase in SPs is paralleled by an increase in injuries. In fact, in every instance that it has been studied in Canada and elsewhere, injuries post-SP openings have significantly exceeded pre-SP injury rates, resulting in significant increased health care costs. Unlike playgrounds, for which there are voluntary safety standards to reduce injury risk, SP can be built with any features - there are no safety guidelines (mandatory or voluntary). The proposed research addresses this child safety issue. The objectives will be achieved by completing two studies that capitalize on a feasibility pilot project already completed by the team. Study 1 will be an observational study of the usage patterns shown by youth (two age groups) on an outdoor SP so we can determine to what extent different features are used and the differential rate of falls for different maneuvers (tricks, typical usage) performed on those features. These findings will be used to develop a ""Guidelines for Safer Design of Skateparks"" manual. In Study 2 we will conduct focus group interviews with youth skateboarders, including those who have experienced a fracture on the SP, to understand their perspectives on our findings and suggestions for solutions. These findings will be used to develop a ""Guide for Safer Skateboarding for Youth"" which will highlight the risk behaviors that increase risk of injuries. These studies can inform future efforts to prevent injuries to youth who skateboard on skateparks."

The Centre, located at Simon Fraser University, will foster relationships among groups of academic and community researchers, community service providers, policy makers, practitioners, advocates, and those who have experience with mental illness from across Canada, the US, UK, and Australia, who will explore the use of gender and sex-based analysis tools and other relevant methods in the following five key theme areas:  mental health reform; recovery and housing; reproductive mental health; violence, mental health, and substance use, and; the criminal justice system, mental health, and substance use.  In addition, through its partnership with the Mental Health Commission of Canada (MHCC), the Centre will develop mechanisms for sharing research findings emerging from the Centre with regional, provincial, national, and international governments, service providers, researchers, and the general public to facilitate access to information about gender and social disparities in mental health and addictions."
Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on treatment for hepatitis B,"['Morrow, Richard']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2537.0,495244,"This study investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the number of individuals who started treatment for hepatitis B from 2020 to 2022. The study evaluated the impact on treatment for hepatitis B in three time periods: June to December 2020, January to December 2021, and January to December 2022. We found that 58 fewer people each month started treatment during June to December 2020, compared to what was expected. This was a decrease of 55.5%, compared to what was expected. In 2021, 50.5% fewer people than expected started treatment, and in 2022, 57.3% fewer people than expected started treatment. Percentage decreases in the number of people starting treatment for hepatitis B were greater for males than females, people under 65 years of age compared to those 65 years or older, and for people who inject drugs compared to those to do not inject drugs. In summary, after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of people starting treatment for hepatitis B was lower than would have been expected in the absence of the pandemic. The number of people starting treatment for hepatitis B remained lower than expected from 2020 to 2022. The impact of the pandemic on the number of people starting treatment for hepatitis B was greater for males, people under 65 years of age, and people who inject drugs."

This study will investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related policies on testing and treatment for hepatitis B from April 2020 to December 2022 in British Columbia (BC). We will look at impacts on the full population of BC and impacts for sex and age groups, prenatal women, people who inject drugs, and immigrants.

This study will provide information to help make policy aimed at eliminating hepatitis B as a public health threat by 2030. It will also provide information to help make policy to deliver health care services related to hepatitis B during future health care system disruptions such as pandemics."
Disseminating research knowledge products with an urban Indigenous youth movement-collective,"['Morton, Darrien S']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],810.0,364486,"Background: Local knowledge sharing practices are often threatened and undermined by totalizing scientific knowledge paradigms. Self-determination, ethical space and integration are important concepts proposed to address these challenges of imbalance, circulating amid discourses on knowledge translation in Indigenous health contexts. The success of applying these concepts in sharing practices, especially in urban areas, has produced mixed results. Moreover, literature does not reflect demographic and technological shifts. The use of computer-mediated communications has led to the re-assignment of cultural and technical meanings to the production and sharing of knowledge. Method: A Knowledge Exchange Network was developed with university researchers and an youth collective to share findings from a participatory network analysis. The analysis explored a Winnipeg-based Indigenous youth movement's engagement in framing processes related to violence. Besides academic knowledge products, producing a movement-relevant multimedia product was prioritized. The process to produce these products was reflexively analyzed to investigate the empirical organization and mobilization of scientific/local knowledges with activists, organizers, academics, artists and funders. Findings: Using the movement concept of frankensteining to analyze the spatial coordination, distribution and inclusion of knowledges into the production of various knowledge products, six key elements were assembled during production: 1) expert-roles, 2) representations, 3) materials, 4) realities, 5) truths, 6) rules. When elements aligned between the movement and university networks in particular configurations, they produced products considering interferences generated by deadlines, trust, authorship, audience, tradition, and voice. Conclusion: The study provides an empirical case on the knowledge production and dissemination practices of urban Indigenous youth involved in research with health researchers."
A  critical policy analysis of Manitoba's Child Welfare System: How do care pathways impact the mental health trajectories of First Nations and Métis children and youth?,"['Morton, Darrien S']",['N/A'],"['Child Welfare', 'Critical Policy Analysis', 'Indigenous Populations', 'Mixed-Methods']",105000.0,458686,"Over 90% of children and youth in Manitoba's child welfare system are Indigenous. When the child welfare system takes a child into care, the state becomes the guardian. The state is responsible for providing necessary supports and protections to children in care to promote health and well-being, including access to mental health, substance use, and addiction services. However, First Nations and Red River Métis (FNM) children and youth in care have poorer mental health and higher substance use and addictions rates. This raises questions about whether the state is doing FNM children and youth in care justice, providing them with supports and protections they deserve. We also do not know how FNM children transition to adulthood and how these pathways through the child welfare system impact their mental health.

In my PhD research, I will conduct a policy analysis of Manitoba's child welfare system to answer these questions using a mixed-methods participatory approach with multiple stakeholders and communities. I will analyze statistical data from Manitoba's child welfare and health services systems to understand the relationship between child welfare involvement and mental health. Furthermore, I will hold talking circles with caregivers and FNM youth involved with child welfare to record their experiences when accessing mental health care and interview people working 'inside' and 'around' mental health and child welfare systems.

I will share lessons with Indigenous community groups and people working in child welfare and health care. My findings will provide the latest evidence to improve services for FNM children in care with better protections to promote mental health. Racism is a major driver of poor mental health and addictions outcomes among FNM youth and the reason many FNM children are taken away from their families and communities. My research will disrupt this legacy to create an environment that supports better health and well-being among Manitoba FNM."

It is the leading cause of developmental disabilities and birth defects in the Western world.  Individuals with FASD live with lifelong challenges such as learning disabilities, impulsive behaviours, hyperactivity, and poor social skills.  In Canada, people with FASD are over-represented in the foster care system and are often repeat offenders in the correctional system.  There is also an unusually high percentage of children and youth diagnosed with FASD in Aboriginal communities.  This research will address issues of social justice and power distribution, by focusing on peoples' everyday lives in two Aboriginal communities to understand how institutional policy, procedures and programs affect them.  Similarly, this research will analyze how FASD diagnoses and behaviours influence beliefs, opinions, policies and interventions by families, community and support systems.  Interviews will be conducted with family members, community members and leaders, as well as professionals and decision-makers from the health, education, child welfare and corrections systems.  Policies and other written documents that inform how individuals, communities and institutions respond to FASD will also be examined.  Findings will highlight successes and identify gaps in effective support, intervention, and prevention in the field of FASD."
Evaluating knowledge translation processes and outcomes in Indigenous health research,"['Morton Ninomiya, Melody']",['N/A'],"['Evaluation', 'Ics Travel Awards', 'Indigenous Health', 'Indigenous Health Research', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Systematic Review']",2700.0,383077,"Introduction: Knowledge translation (KT) is about sharing research knowledge that is both relevant and valued. Effective KT is critical to implementing program and policy changes that require shared understandings of knowledge systems, assumptions, and practices. Since mainstream KT approaches and activities do not necessarily resonate with Indigenous ways of knowing and doing, we conducted a systematic review of evaluated KT in Indigenous health research to identify wise and promising Indigenous KT practices in Canada and abroad.

Methods: A systematic review was guided by Indigenous health researchers, engaged Indigenous Elders, and used an Indigenous research critical appraisal tool. The search included published literature from indexed and non-indexed databases globally and grey literature from Indigenous health research funders (government and Indigenous organizations) within Canada only. Included documents had to meet the following criteria: 1) focused on primarily Indigenous people; 2) linked to Indigenous health and well-being; 3) document KT goals, activities, and rationale; 4) evaluated the KT activities or outcomes; and 5) scored six or more in their critical appraisal.

Results: Findings from this review reveal wise KT approaches and practices as well as methods used to evaluate KT in Indigenous contexts. The presentation will highlight how 1) effective Indigenous KT is conceptually and operationally different from mainstream KT and 2) Indigenous KT has been evaluated.

Conclusions: While authors increasingly report on KT activities in Indigenous research contexts, few KT initiatives are evaluated. Evaluation of the process and outcomes of Indigenous KT remains underdeveloped."

The concept of KT has been widely promoted and prioritized by funding agencies and research institutions. In recent years, scholars who work in Indigenous research contexts have drawn attention to how aspects of mainstream concepts and language around KT are inadequate and inappropriate for research with Indigenous communities. In the context of an
ongoing health disparity between Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations in Canada, there is an urgent and critical need to know how to assess relevance and rigor of Indigenous KT principles and practices in health research. This research project will produce: 1) a systematic review of KT practices used for health research with Indigenous populations; 2) an inventory of Indigenous KT initiatives in Canada from 2005-2015 to the present using a web-based survey; and 3) highlights of best practice principles in Indigenous KT within Canada, based on an in-depth study. The systematic review, inventory, and best practices will form the basis for an evaluation tool to assess the quality and relevance of Indigenous KT in health research. The evaluation tool will then be systematically tested refined, based inter-rater reliability (the level of agreement between reviewers using the evaluation tool) on randomly selected health research articles on health interventions. The results from this study will produce a systematic review that synthesizes information for evidence-informed policy and practices, researchers, and research stakeholders. The inventory and in-depth study will make exemplary Indigenous KT practices and products accessible and visible. Most importantly, this research will produce a concrete and tested tool that bridges knowledge gaps between health policy makers, practitioners, researchers, and Indigenous community stakeholders alike."
Profiling strengths and resilience: A qualitative analysis of narratives from First Nations men and women with lived experiences of mental health and substance use challenges,"['Morton Ninomiya, Melody']",['N/A'],"['Addictions', 'First Nation', 'Ics Travel Awards', 'Indigenous', 'Mental Health', 'Resilience', 'Strengths-Based', 'Violence']",1870.0,368402,"Background: The Researching Health in Ontario Communities (RHOC) and Five Views on a Journey projects used a mobile laboratory to visit several different communities to conduct community-identified research on issues related to mental health, substance use, and violence (MSV). As part of these projects, in-depth interviews were conducted with people who had experienced MSV as well as family members of people with MSV issues to examine their experiences coping with and seeking help for MSV issues. This presentation will focus on the in-depth interviews in two First Nations (FN) communities.

Methods: A qualitative analysis of 109 interviews from RHOC and Five Views projects will identify how strengths and resilience resources affected the process of recovery for individuals with lived experiences of mental health and substance use. Using an inductive and iterative approach, emergent themes related to strengths, resilience resources, and recovery processes will be identified by two independent researchers, with analysis conducted separately for men and women.

Results: Preliminary results from one community suggest that helpful mental health supports came from the local community health services and methadone clinic as well as Elders and probation officers. When seeking help, participants hoped to achieve sobriety, healing, wellness, freedom, being a better parent, and better coping skills for their substance use and mental health issues. Participants indicated that having children, access to methadone treatment, and distancing from stressors and substance use played a big role in their recovery. Although preliminary results were shared with the communities, the present analyses will help to bring greater depth of understanding of how various strengths and supports play a role in the process. The findings will also help develop theories regarding buffering effects of strengths and resilience, based on similarities and differences in the two communities."

Exploring the biological and behavioural causes of sarcopenia through large biobanks and Mendelian randomization analyses,"['Morton, Robert']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Genetics', 'Musculoskeletal Health', 'Population Health']",135000.0,396988,"At approximately the fifth decade of life humans start losing muscle mass and strength (i.e., sarcopenia). Importantly, sarcopenia is associated with a number of negative health outcomes including fracture risk, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality. Thus, understanding, preventing, and reversing sarcopenia would substantially improve public health. Accordingly, the present research project proposal is designed to identify the biological and behavioural causes of sarcopenia. Using large datasets generated from the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology Study and the UK Biobank, we will explore the behavioural (e.g., diet and physical activity) and biological (e.g., proteins measured in the blood) factors that may mediate sarcopenia. Our findings will establish behavioural factors that mediate sarcopenia, which will encourage healthcare professionals to advocate for them as preventative medicine. In addition, by identifying a biomarker for sarcopenia we will provide healthcare professionals and researchers with a feasible assessment tool and an outcome to target for intervention. We hypothesize this project will considerably improve our understanding of sarcopenia and will be a strong contribution towards the goal of preventing, reversing, and eliminating sarcopenia altogether."

Literacy (cultural, reading, writing, and numeracy) affects an individual's ability to improve their health literacy. Health literacy can enable individuals to access, understand, evaluate and communicate the information needed to promote, maintain and improve their health. Health disparities in First Nations, Métis, and Inuit (FNMI) communities may be reduced by increasing knowledge of cultural, language, age, and gender barriers to health literacy.
The 2-day HEALER Project Symposium will 1) create a university-community research network to study Indigenous knowledge, health literacy and health; 2) establish a research plan based on community priorities; and 3) develop plans for knowledge exchange about research on the relationship between Indigenous ways of knowing (e.g. land-based education and cultural proficiency), cultural literacy, language proficiency, health literacy, and health. The symposium will be held in Winnipeg, a hub for northern and southern Manitoba communities.
The theme for symposium day 1 is, ""Finding Common Ground"". Community representatives, knowledge keepers, and university-researchers will establish a joint understanding for community-based participatory research collaborations based on the principles of Ownership, Control, Access, and Possession for research involving FNMI communities. Symposium day 2 theme is, ""Coming Together"". It will build on the research collaborations formed during day one. Community-university research partners will begin developing ideas for specific research pertaining to Indigenous knowledge, land-based education, health literacy and health e.g. studies to investigate how strengthening First Nations languages improves health literacy.
The HEALER project symposium will result in research to increase understanding of factors that improve health literacy and the health status of FNMI communities. The symposium will be held April 2016."

Community garden projects may improve access to healthy foods and lower risks for diabetes and other chronic diseases.  They may produce positive mental health and physical exercise benefits too.  In Manitoba, gardening projects tend to focus on Northern communities.  Studies show that Indigenous Peoples living in urban neighbourhoods may also benefit.  Urban community gardening can provide a connection to nature and cultural roots.  Culturally relevant programs link nutrition and food to Indigenous knowledge and practices.

The Urban Garden project is a community-based research partnership with Indigenous organizations in Winnipeg and Brandon, Manitoba.  The goal of the project is to improve the holistic health and wellbeing of Indigenous youth.  Indigenous youth (18-29 years) participating in the Mino-Pimatisiwin project along with 25-30 community garden participants will engage in all phases of the research.  We anticipate 3 major outcomes of the Urban Garden project.  The project will build youth leadership to identify and addressing food security challenges.  Culturally relevant indicators for holistic health benefits of urban gardening will be developed for individuals and neighbourhoods.  Youth participants will design a demonstration garden that integrates best practices and cultural indicators.  A framework that is based on the Medicine Wheel will be used to investigate the effects of community gardening on physical, emotional, mental and spiritual health.  The research will be conducted using a photographic storytelling research method. Storytelling is an Indigenous method of sharing knowledge."
MPH Practicums for Future Public Health Practitioners,"['Moses, Stephen']",['N/A'],"['Mph', 'Practicum', 'Public Health']",,284787,"The Masters in Public Health (MPH) program at the University of Manitoba was developed to educate and train graduate level students with a background in training and/or experience in health/health care to better prepare for work as public health practitioners. The primary intent is to increase the number of competent public health practitioners in Canada. Our program attempts to balance public health theory and practice, preparing our graduates to work at many levels in the public health system, including decision-making, policy advice, program development, implementation and evaluation. 
The MPH program has been designed with a balance of didactic courses - some of which are mandatory (e.g. biostatistics and epidemiology) and some elective (e.g. economic evaluation, program evaluation) - and practical experience and training.
Unlike our Masters of Community Health Sciences which requires the completion of a master-level thesis and is intended for researchers, the MPH program requires the completion of a three month (full-time equivalent) practicum. This practicum is located off site from the university in a public health practice setting (e.g. regional health authority public health unit, provincial government program unit) and is jointly overseen by a local supervisor and a University faculty member. These practicums are taken after all courses have been completed. It is anticipated that there will be between five and ten practicums per year, based on the current number of students that have applied and been accepted, with anticipated future growth.
With no stipends for students, the program and these practicums can be a significant financial burden for the students, especially if there are additional expenses (e.g. equipment, travel). Vouchers to support these practicums would be very helpful to our mission to attract the best MPH students and provide them with a very useful and practical training to strengthen public health practice in Canada."

Understanding how experiences of psychological stress during pregnancy become embedded in children's brain development is the focus of the Fetal Programming Study. The study is following 440 women from pregnancy through to child age 8; currently we are assessing children at ages 4 - 6 years. During pregnancy, we collected biological samples and questionnaire data to accurately document participants' physiological and psychological experiences of stress and mental health. Postnatally, we used a variety of biological, physiological and behavioural measures to assess stress reactivity among infants at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months of age. We also carefully measured maternal stress in the postnatal period along with other aspects of infant experience that could affect their brain and mental health outcomes. We are pursuing the hypothesis that maternal stress during pregnancy leads to dysregulation of stress reactivity in infancy, and this in turn leads to behavioural and mental health disorders in children."

For the past two years our research team has been engaging with youth and families in Canada to build a stakeholder-informed national program of Pandemic Preparedness research, to understand and mitigate the complex impacts of the pandemic on day-to-day life and wellbeing for youth and families living in Canada. However, through the conduction of this work, we have identified critical areas requiring additional study to ensure vital knowledge gaps do not persist in our understanding and management of pandemic impacts for Canadian families. These areas include: 1) ongoing negative impacts of the pandemic on day-to-day life and wellbeing for youth and families and 2) evolving mitigating strategies and solutions for youth and family wellbeing. Our proposed work involves two overlapping and interconnected projects that expand our existing work. First, we will synthesize evidence-informed strategies to mitigate negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth and family wellbeing, harnessed from our already funded knowledge synthesis projects, in a consensus process with youth and families, clinicians, knowledge users, and decision makers. Second, we are requesting funds to conduct a national stakeholder meeting to generate and communicate evidence-informed consensus statements on youth and family pandemic recovery informed by youth and family experiences. Our ultimate aim is to partner with diverse youth and families in Canada to understand the evolution of their experiences and needs throughout COVID-19 recovery to co-create solutions that develop and mobilize health research that contributes meaningfully to timely, equitable, and effective responses and recovery."

As a result, posttraumatic stress injuries (PTSI) such as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety, have also been found to be higher in PSP than in the general population. Most research in this area has relied on self-report questionnaires instead of measuring mental disorders using clinical diagnoses, has not looked at the mental health of PSP over time, and has rarely looked into the reasons why these individuals would not obtain mental healthcare or use coping strategies that might help prevent the development of a mental health problem. The proposed research will address these gaps by combining information from administrative health records with the collection of a new survey of two groups of PSP - firefighters and paramedics (FP) - in Winnipeg, Manitoba: Aim 1) Determine the FP who were diagnosed with a mental or substance use disorder, had a suicide attempt, or had a mental health-related Workers Compensation claim, and compare these numbers to a group of non-FP adults and to mental disorders in FP pre-COVID-19. Aim 2) Look at potential protective factors for mental disorders in FP, compared to a group of employed Winnipeg residents. Aim 3) Measure the amount of mental healthcare use among FP in the past year compared to a cohort of employed Winnipeg residents and identify barriers to care. This study will provide new information about the extent of mental disorders in FP, and therefore, can be used to advocate for more mental health resources for this population. Findings will also help the development of new programs and strategies to overcome the most common barriers to seeking mental healthcare in this population."

By working together with them, we will co-design and modify our existing Nutrition and Exercise Lifestyle Intervention Program (NELIP) to deliver it in a different more culturally sensitive participant-centred holistic approach to reduce GDM rates and thus prevent future T2D in these young adults and their children. A pilot study with culturally sensitive nutrition and exercise goals that also considers mental and spiritual health will then determine the best strategy for effective behaviour change. We will randomize pregnant AIMD into one of 3 strategies: Group A) Full NELIP, Nutrition AND Exercise offered together; Group B) Nutrition given at study entry (14 weeks gestation), followed in sequence by Exercise introduced at 25 weeks gestation; or Group C) Exercise started at entry followed sequentially by Nutrition added at 25 weeks. We aim to determine the best strategy by which GDM and T2D risk can be reduced in young AIMD through positive behaviours that support a healthy lifestyle. This process of co-design can then be applied to assist other high-risk ethnic groups in developing lifestyle change to help reduce GDM and T2D risk in the young parent and future child."
Enabling monitoring of ultra-processed food consumption among Canadians: Development and validation of a screener,"['Moubarac, Jean-Claude']","['Byker Shanks, Carmen', 'Hammond, David G', 'Kirkpatrick, Sharon', 'Polsky, Jane Y', 'Vanderlee, Lana M']","['Cohort Studies', 'Dietary Assessment', 'Monitoring', 'Nutrition', 'Obesity And Non-Communicables Diseases', 'Ultra-Processed Food', 'Validation Studies']",286876.0,420433,"Dietary risk factors are among the top contributors to morbidity and mortality in Canada and globally. There is increasing attention to the harmful impact of ultra-processed foods and beverages (UPF) on dietary quality and health, yet no validated instrument exists to rapidly measure the intake of UPF. Consumption of UPF has been linked to poor diet quality and increased risk for obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases in many countries, including in Canada. In 2015, UPF made up half of the average daily energy consumed by Canadian and the 2019 Canada's Food Guide recommends limiting 'highly' processed or UPF. There is a need to develop an instrument that has the ability to rapidly measure UPF intake for use in a range of research, clinical and public health practice settings and that is based on Canadian's dietary patterns. To this end, the goal of this project is to enable the monitoring of consumption of UPF, a potent indicator of diet quality, in Canadian research through the development and validation of a brief UPF Screener that can be integrated into ongoing surveillance and cohort studies, as well as in clinical and public health practice. The scope of the project requires a multi-disciplinary research team with distinct and related expertise in public health and clinical nutrition, epidemiology, dietary assessment, instrument development and validation, which we have assembled. The UPF Screener will be developed in both official languages of Canada (English and French), and will be based on nationally representative dietary data, evaluated by an Expert Advisory Committee, tested with Canadian adults in Montreal city and revised to ensure rigor and relevance. The UPF Screener will produce a score that estimates individual and population level intake of UPF intake as an indicator of unhealthy diets, which can be used in surveillance, intervention and epidemiology."
Wellness Experiences of Indigenous Women in Canada: A Critical Review of the Literature,"['Moucessian, Anoushka M']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],995.0,364679,"Evidence shows that girls and women with disabilities are at greater risk of violence (Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, 2012) with Indigenous women 3.5 times more likely to experience abuse and violence (NWAC, 2013). As a result, Indigenous women with disabilities face increased vulnerability related to the intersectionality between gender, age, disability and Indigenous identity (Brownridge, 2006). These experiences carry heavy implications when it comes to the mental health and wellness of these women which could lead to chronic self-destructive behaviours, alterations in self-perception and increased risk of suicidality (Sochting et al., 2007). Despite this, few support services in Canada recognize the specific cultural and social context of Indigenous women with disabilities (Halseth, 2013). In addition, specific UN guidelines and mandates relating to Indigenous peoples or persons with disabilities (UNDG, 2008) are way behind in terms of realization of their rights. Colonial policies continue to create socio-political barriers which restrict women in exercising their right to health and well-being.
 
This paper is based upon the synthesis of literature available on the mental health and wellness of Indigenous women with disabilities in Canada. The aim of this critical review is to develop an understanding of the mental health experiences of Indigenous women in Canada. This research attempts to answer the following questions: Is there any literature available on the mental health and wellness experiences of Indigenous women with disabilities in Canada? And what are the mental health and wellness experiences of Indigenous women with disabilities in Canada? 
 
A critical literature review approach is utilized in answering the research questions."

Some populations suffer more than others, including teens, older adults, women and racialized communities. It is important to understand and document the pathways linking living conditions - including neighbourhood characteristics and housing conditions -, to mental health and well-being trajectories and inequities, to provide key insights supporting rapid targeted policies and interventions. 

The COHESION project is a longitudinal study combining individual and living condition data from online questionnaires to explore the role that neighborhood social and physical environments play in mental health and well-being trajectories during the post-pandemic recovery period. In particular, we seek to understand the role of these environments on observed changes in health behaviors, such as daily mobility, sleep, and social contacts. We will further assess how these relations vary by gender, age group, income and education level, ethnic identification, and province. This study uses online questionnaires, smartphone app, geographic information systems and various statistical models to test the hypothesized pathways.

The study will help generate high-quality evidence about how neighbourhood and housing environments affect long-term outcomes of mental health and well-being, to support Canada's response efforts and guide post-pandemic recovery. In the context of a pandemic where wait times for mental health services in some places exceed one year, there is an urgent need to find alternatives to meet these needs in a sustainable and comprehensive way. We are among the best-positioned teams in Canada to provide rapid and accurate data on the levers in cities that can positively affect the mental health and well-being of the population."
Examining patterns of sexual exploitation among street-involved and homeless boys in British Columbia,"['Moynihan, Melissa']",['N/A'],"['Adolescent Health', 'Quantitative Analysis', 'Street-Involved And Homeless Youth']",105000.0,327858,"Street-involved and homeless youth are at high risk of being sexually exploited. Sexual exploitation is associated with significant health care concerns including problematic substance use, sexually transmitted infections, self-harm and suicidality. Consequently, it is an important public health issue. Research findings suggest similar rates of boys and girls report ever being exploited, but media and government reports fuel the common perception of girls being more likely to be sexually exploited. There is a scarcity of information and research about sexually exploited boys. As a result, health care services and interventions for this sub-population are extremely limited. The proposed study will examine the context and detailed experiences of sexually exploited boys to provide the much needed data to develop interventions and services specifically for sexually exploited boys. The third multi-city street-involved and homeless youth survey, aged 12-19, will be conducted in 12 communities across British Columbia in Fall 2014. The survey consists of questions relevant to the life experiences and health issues of street-involved youth and includes several questions designed to elicit information about sexual exploitation. Using quantitative analysis of survey data the proposed study will examine patterns of sexual exploitation experienced by boys including: who are the exploiters, where exploitation is occurring, frequency of trading sex and what is being traded. It will explore health outcomes based on combinations of risks and protective factors. This research will identify patterns of sexual exploitation and potential protective factors that help foster resilience among street-involved and homeless boys to improve knowledge about the health care and social services this sub-population needs. This information is necessary to better design and implement services and interventions to improve the health of sexually exploited boys."
Examining the impact of dietary diversity/food variety on type 2 Diabetes,"['Mozaffari, Hadis']",['N/A'],"['Case-Cohort', 'Diet', 'Dietary Diversity', 'Epic-Interact Study', 'Food Variety', 'Type 2 Diabetes']",150000.0,437251,"Diversity in a diet has long been considered essential to healthy eating and many dietary guidelines have incorporated recommendations on dietary diversity to reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, some dietary guidelines have minimized and potentially undermined the importance of dietary diversity by reducing the number of food groups relevant to a healthy diet. Moreover, most of the diet quality measures do not capture dietary diversity, while quality and diversity are not completely alike despite a positive correlation, and diversity may be linked to disease prevention independent of quality. 
To date, most of the existing knowledge on dietary diversity comes from developing countries, where dietary diversity is an approach to address nutritional inadequacy, and thus is not a measure of diet quality in the context of a sufficient amount of food. And, in higher-income settings, research on dietary diversity rarely looks at the risk of T2D. Even less is known about diversity within food groups separate from the diversity of total diet. Moreover, although we know from previous studies that gender/sex, socio-economic status, and obesity can affect both dietary intakes and development of diabetes, it is still unclear whether mentioned factors can alter the degree of a potential association between dietary diversity and T2D. The underlying mechanism linking dietary diversity to T2D also remained to be elucidated, despite some studies separately showing the beneficial effect of dietary diversity on gut microbes and the protective effect of gut microbes against T2D. Therefore, this project aims to use data from multiple European countries to answer three main questions: (1) Do greater diversity across total foods and within food groups (e.g. vegetables) reduce the risk of T2D?; (2) Is this relationship altered by gender/sex, socio-economic status, and obesity?; and (3) Do gut microbes have a role in linking diversity to diabetes?."

There is a lack of research evidence to guide the development of men-centred health promotion services and programs. That said, workplace health promotion programs are known to assist workers to reduce risk behaviours (e.g., smoking) and improve healthy practices (healthy eating and exercise habits); however, women are more likely to participate and benefit from such programs than men. This suggests that we are missing opportunities for engaging men in health promotion activities in the workplace. The proposed project will explore men's needs and recommendations in order to create a workplace health promotion program that will help men improve their health. 

A needs analysis will assure that the program is grounded in the men's experiences and preferences as a means to engaging men with their health and health promotion activities. The first phase will include conducting one-on-one interviews with managers and focus groups with men working at Vancouver General Hospital (VGH). Findings from these interviews and focus groups will inform the second phase, to design a health promotion program for men that will be piloted at VGH. The final phase will involve pilot testing the program and applying for funding to launch a full scale project that will include evaluating the program at a range of venues, including several large employers which have expressed interest in hosting a program. The proposed 3 year project is supported by the Men's Health Initiative and affiliated researchers from UBC, and hosted by VGH and Vancouver Coastal Health Authority."

The complex interactions between the virus, individual hosts and populations warrant a One Health approach, whereby a multi-disciplinary lens is applied to address complex challenges relating to viruses with pandemic potential.

Our team has been screening a range of wildlife species for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and have identified several deer in Ontario and Quebec with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ongoing viral activity in deer may represent a new viral reservoir, and we have shown that deer in Ontario have a highly divergent, or mutated SARS-CoV-2 virus and that deer-to-deer and deer-to-human transmission have occurred. Divergent viruses, or variants have the potential to undermine medical countermeasures such as vaccination and to cause enhanced disease in humans and wildlife.

Our objectives as an inter-disciplinary group of collaborators examining virus inter-species spillover are to establish a framework and risk assessment approach for the detection and characterization of  zoonotic viruses in wildlife, and to ensure knowledge mobilization and translation through a new initiative, the Wildlife Emerging Pathogen Initiative, or Wild-EPI.

To do this, we propose to address key scientific questions around zoonotic virus ecology, epidemiology and biology in wildlife. We will use a One Health approach to identify  of SARS-CoV-2 and avian influenza virus in wildlife, determine viral circulation among animals and spill back into humans, and the risk of transmission and disease. The proposed work will provide decision and policy-makers with critical information for timely decision-making for emerging pathogens."

Recent spillover events (sread from animals to humans) from wildlife triggered outbreaks caused by mpox, Ebola and Marburg viruses, and high consequence coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV).

Despite the monumental impacts of these viral zoonoses, conventional public health
programs rarely focus on the prevention of zoonotic pathogen emergence and spread. In
Canada, there are substantial functional gaps in efforts to incorporate animal surveillance (testing of animals) in public health. This partly stems from siloed approaches to training and practice across sectors. We have an important window to develop and apply knowledge to prevent the spillover of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI), a leading potential cause for the next pandemic.

I propose a plan of work based on a One Health approach that considers how the interconnections between humans, animals and the environment they share to prevent zoonotic pathogen spillover. To this end, I will identify settings and situations at highest risk for zoonotic spillover and strive to understand predisposing factors to identify key control points for surveillance and prevention. I will also address ecosystem stressors (e.g. climate change) as they relate to landscape immunity (or how healthy ecosystems protect us from infections), and will  work with decision makers to enable translation through existing and novel instruments for communication and policy.

This proposal will fill several longstanding gaps in upstream prevention of viral zoonotic
spillover and pandemic prevention and launch new initiatives that will allow us to focus research and policy to keep dangerous pathogens from spreading between animals and humans."

The three Southern Dakelh First Nations recognize these health trends in their young people and want to create a program to support wellness. Before a program can be created, researchers need to better understand the experience of wellness for Dakelh youth. Wellness is affected by multiple factors called the social determinants of health. Indigenous health inequities stem from the colonialism, racism, and social exclusion. It is important to consider all the factors that are significant to preserving Dakelh wellness. Gathering this information was done through surveys and interviews with youth (n=29) and community members (n=19). This project was carried out collaboratively between the University of British Columbia and the Quesnel Dakelh Education and Employment Society. The Quesnel Dakelh Education and Employment Society aims to connect community members with health, social, and educational programs to support their education and employment goals.

For young men it was often video games; for young women, it was the Internet; for mothers, shopping or work; and for fathers, pornography use or work. Interactions with others (including family members about these behaviours) also became patterned in problematic ways, possibly exacerbating excessive behavioural patterns. While there is evidence from brain imagining research showing the repetitive or patterned nature of these behaviours, there is a lack of research examining the social practices (such as family interactions) that sustain or impede these behaviours. I am interested in understanding these behaviours in an additional way, by examining how these behaviours are influenced by interactions, practices, and cultural messages surrounding these behaviours. 

The objective of my research is to develop an additional way of understanding excessive patterned behaviours (gambling, internet use, video game playing, shopping, working, eating, and sex) by examining how individuals engage in these behaviours, how their interactions with their family members influence and are influenced by the behaviours, and the cultural messages influencing these behaviours. My findings should yield alternative options for Canadians to understand and address these behaviours for themselves and others, with more possibilities for change. Furthermore, results from this project may have implications for policy and economic decisions, by treating aspects of excessive behaviours socially rather than relying exclusively on the health care system."

Over the last 25 year, obesity rates among children in Canada have nearly tripled. During childhood, obesity is associated with adverse health effects and deficits in cognitive processes that are involved in the conscious control of action and thought. Another factor related to childhood obesity is self-regulation, which includes the adjustment of cognition, motivation and emotion. For example, a study on emotional regulation found that toddlers who had poorer emotional regulation skills and lower inhibitory control skills were more likely to be categorized as overweight or at risk for being overweight in early childhood.  Research also suggests young children are inactive during child care and preschool, which is a contributing factor to childhood obesity.  However, we know that regular physical activity can reduce the risk of health related conditions and chronic disease; thus, it is urgent to encourage healthy behavior during childhood. In our discussion we will: a) describe current statistics related to childhood obesity, b) present information on factors related to childhood obesity, and c) discuss long term health implications and interventions.  Our goal is to present a select series of factors to illustrate how childhood obesity is complex societal issue which makes the development of successful interventions a challenging process.

For instance, a child can spend a couple of hours playing hockey, and then spend the rest of the day in front of a TV. Thus, we will have to focus on both physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviour (SED) in curbing childhood obesity. Moreover, today, more than ever before, we depend on technology to get our work done, which makes us more sedentary and in turn more obese than ever before. As we have engineered obesity into our lives, to reverse this epidemic, we need to engineer it out of our lives. 

To achieve this, we need to understand where within a city are children active or sedentary in all seasons. The idea is to relay this evidence to policy makers so that our environment could be modified to increase PA and decrease SED throughout the year. 

The objective of this study is to understand the role played by urban environment in children's PA and SED. To do this, we will identify and map locations and patterns of PA and SED accumulation in children in all seasons of Saskatoon. We will recruit 800 children from different neighbourhoods of Saskatoon and measure their PA and SED using GPS equipped accelerometers in four different seasons. Extensive weather and built environment data of Saskatoon, and household data of children will be collectively used to understand children's locations and patterns of PA and SED accumulation.

This approach will help us understand the influence of urban environment on children's activity, thus paving the way to modify urban spaces to increase PA and decrease SED in children in all seasons. Lack of PA and rising SED is associated with rising childhood obesity, and childhood obesity in turn is linked to chronic conditions like heart disease and stroke. Thus, by conducting this study, we are taking a proactive approach to facilitate the modification of children's behaviour at an early age, leading to healthy, active lifestyles in adulthood."

At the same time, there is a growing need to understand what programs, policies, or even changes to program delivery systems work to improve the health and wellbeing of all children in Saskatoon.

This research program brings together a team of researchers from the universities in Saskatchewan, health region, health quality council, a city councillor, and various community based organizations to find solutions that works, and why, that would improve child and family health in Saskatoon. The research team will involve various sectors (for example, health, education, social services, municipal government) and will span the full spectrum of the prevention-care continuum -- primary (upstream), secondary (mid-stream) and tertiary (downstream). This study will uncover not only whether these interventions make a difference through a monitoring framework, but also for whom and under which conditions."

The goal of our research is to understand and model how the introduction of several community-based food programs impact the health of individuals and families (in particular diabetes and obesity). Our proposed research will study over a period of five years the impacts of 1) one large food intervention (the Good Food Junction grocery store) and, 2) a series of other medium and small food and nutrition programs. The Good Food Junction, when it opens in summer 2012, will be a 4900 sq ft full-service not-for-profit grocery store containing a full range of fresh, frozen and packaged foods. It is located in a low-income food desert neighbourhood in Saskatoon's inner city. The other programs we will study include some within the Good Food Junction - such as nutrition education and food pricing changes - and at least three others. In addition, we will conduct an analysis of policies that impact food access, availability and quality in cities and beyond. The Good Food Junction will be newly opened when this program of research begins and we intend to study its effects on the community from implementation until at least four years after opening. This research presents a unique opportunity to study and understand how transformation occurs from a food desert with poor health outcomes to neighbourhoods with healthy food and healthy citizens. This research is timely, as organizations in cities across Canada are following the development of the Good Food Junction closely because they are also seeking solutions to issues of food access and poor nutrition in low-income neighbourhoods."

There are still many questions that need answers.  Personal stories about these challenges abound but, to date, there is no systematically collected information about these challenges. 

The aim of this project, therefore, is to estimate the impact of the second year of COVID-19 pandemic on the prevalence and severity of mental health and quality of life among children (8-11y), adolescents (12-15y), and youth (16-18y) and the need for and receipt of mental health services. 

Building on a study currently being completed in terms of recruitment of child and parent/caregiver dyads in Saskatchewan, this project extends it to the future: investigating children/youth mental health into the second year of the pandemic. Four questions are addressed: 1. Are children's and youth's mental health and quality of life outcomes different in 2022 in comparison to the outcomes in April-July 2021? 2. What coping strategies are utilized, if any, and what is the association between these coping strategies and mental health and quality of life outcomes? 3. What role have mental health services played in helping young people deal with the challenges of the pandemic? 4. How are sociodemographic characteristics (e.g., sex at birth, self-declared gender, disability, family income, culture/ethnicity, immigrant status) associated with these variables?

The ultimate aim is to provide evidence-based recommendations to decision-makers and practitioners that, if acted on, will improve the mental health well-being of children and youth in Saskatchewan."

Protecting children is a key priority area for governments and global organizations including the United Nations and the World Health Organization. This is particularly relevant to countries with generalized HIV epidemics that have strained the national capacity to protect children. In response to the need for rigorous evidence to inform policy and programming for the protection of children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed and conducted the National Violence Against Children (VAC) Surveys in Swaziland, Tanzania, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Haiti, Cambodia and Indonesia. The VAC Surveys systematically measure physical, emotional and sexual violence against children and have documented that almost 60% of children have experienced violence before the age of 18 years. To date, the CDC has produced technical reports that describe the epidemiological patterns of child violence, evaluate health systems and make recommendations for interventions to prevent violence against children, however the multi-national datasets remain largely unexplored. In collaboration with Columbia University and the University of Ottawa, this research program will use the multi-national VAC Surveys to explore the linkages between individual, relationship, community and societal factors to investigate how violence against children is a product of multiple features of a childs environment. Results of these analyses are designed to inform programming and policy in child protection and HIV/AIDS prevention to promote safer societies for children."

Young women remain educationally and economically disenfranchised, increasing their risk of exchanging sex for survival. Elevated rates of HIV infection commonly accompany the post-conflict phase, emphasizing the need for evidence-based strategies to intervene as Northern Uganda transitions to post-conflict after 20 years of war. Within a longitudinal study of HIV prevention and care among female youth who exchange sex for survival in Northern Uganda, this proposal aims to: 
1) Estimate the prevalence of historical GBV among youth and relationship to HIV prevalence; 2) Examine how historical violence shapes patterns of condom use with clients and incidents of interpersonal violence; 3) Estimate the incidence of HIV infection among youth mediated by historical and current experiences of GBV. 
Methods: Participants (n = 500 women engaged in sex for survival; 14-29 years) will be recruited through The AIDS Support Organization (TASO), the most well-established indigenous AIDS organization in Africa. This study will use participatory mapping and time-location sampling to identify young women and the places where they congregate. We will use Logistic regression to examine the relationship between violence and the biological and socio-cultural associations with HIV status. Survival analysis will be used to determine the gendered predictors of sero-conversion over a 2-year follow-up period. 
Outcome: The post-conflict moment in Uganda is a critical time to address the needs of young women and combat the further escalation of Uganda's HIV epidemic. Results from this research will inform evidence-based HIV prevention among one of the most at-risk groups and contribute to TASO's intervention efforts, both in Northern Uganda and other branches across Uganda."

1) Our youth-focused Café Scientifique is a collaboration with Foundry, a BC-wide network of integrated health and wellness services for young people. A Foundry project, recently funded by CIHR, looked at the influence of TikTok on youth regarding mental health and connecting to health services. This Café will focus on the results of this project as well as include youth panelists who help shape the research ongoing at Foundry to improve youth mental health. 

2) In collaboration with the Canadian Collaboration for Prison Health and Education, CHÉOS will host a Café Scientifique with a panel of researchers and people with lived experiences of incarceration to discuss access to sexual health services while in prison. Unfortunately, there is reduced access to sexually transmissible and blood-borne infection testing and care in prison, which is further exacerbated by stigma. Our panel aims to combine storytelling and research to reduce the stigma for both sexual health testing and incarceration.

However, there is a lack of evidence which comprehensively and systematically characterizes the marketing intensity, nutritional quality and dietary impacts of child-appealing food products on Canadian children, which will be integral to supporting and informing this policy development. 
The focus of this project is therefore to analyze the extent, nature and intensity of child-appealing food marketing in Canada. Secondly, this research will evaluate the nutritional quality and the impact that consuming these products may have on Canadian children's diet quality. 
Drawing on product packaging data from the the University of Toronto Food Label Information Program (FLIP) 2017 database, products with child-appealing marketing on their packaging will be analyzed.  The nutritional information found in FLIP will allow for the evaluation of the nutritional quality of these products using a series of nutrient profile models developed specifically for characterizing the healthfulness of child-appealing products.  These findings will be applied to children's food consumption data from the 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey in order investigate the impact of consuming child-appealing food products on the overall quality of children's diets in Canada.

The persistently low rate of skilled birth attendance, particularly in rural areas, has been identified as one key reason for its  high MMR. To address the lack of skilled maternal healthcare providers in rural areas, the government of Pakistan created a new cadre of midwives called Community Midwives (CMWs). CMWs are young rural women between the ages of 18 to 35 years who are provided with 18-months of midwifery training. They are deployed to their home-villages to provide domiciliary antenatal, childbirth, and postnatal care. Currently, the program is functioning sub-optimally  with nearly 80% of the CMWs not working. Our research identified gendered restrictions on women's mobility, characteristic of this society, as a key barrier that deterred the women from delivering services. There is an urgent need to identify strategies and interventions to support the CMWs to overcome these gendered mobility restrictions. In collaboration with the Government of Pakistan, specifically the Pakistan Maternal, Neonatal and Child Health program, we aim to develop a pilot intervention to test ways to support the CMWs to overcome the gendered mobility restrictions they face in their provision of timely maternity care. To ensure the research meets the needs of knowledge users,  we propose to conduct a 3-day planning workshop with the Director-General Health, Chief of the MNCH program, and the chief of the Policy & Planning Unit. Early-stage involvement of these key stakeholders is crucial to development a common understanding of community needs, priority issues, and viability of ideas. The expected outcome of the 3-day event is a logic model that will be the basis of a grant application."

While simple, cost-effective strategies can reduce maternal deaths, vulnerable women living at the economic and social margins of society often do not receive the necessary services. This study will examine how class and gender influence the design and delivery of maternal health services, and how these factors may affect poor women's access to health services in Pakistan, one of the 13 countries with the highest maternal mortality rates.

Social understandings of class, caste, gender and related distinctions as experienced in Pakistan will be explored using a range of interdisciplinary methods, and patterns of maternal health care usage (and barriers to usage) according to these social distinctions will be documented. Information will be collected from two groups of participants: (1) poor, socially disadvantaged women and men, and (2) district, provincial and federal level policy-makers, program managers and health service providers. Later workshops with policy-makers and service providers will facilitate translation of these research results into improved maternal health policy and practice. This project will also increase interdisciplinary research capacity in both Canada and Pakistan.

We also evaluated how patients perceived the pamphlet's content, appearance, format, delivery, and comprehensibility.
Methods: The pamphlet was developed in partnership with Health Authorities and was compliant with the Society of Obstetrician and Gynaecologists of Canada professional practice guidelines for VBAC. Focus groups were conducted in four British Columbia sites with an ethnically diverse sample of women who had had a caesarean and were pregnant or considering pregnancy. The focus group consisted of: (1) a 5-item knowledge pre-test and single question on intention to plan a VBAC; (2) reading the pamphlet; (3) knowledge and intention post-test; and (4) moderated discussion. Focus group transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis. 
Results: 17 women participated in 4 focus groups. Post-test knowledge scores increased for all 5 items, but women's intentions to plan a VBAC did not change. Participants found the pamphlet to be usable and comprehensible and recommended sharing it with other women as well as family members. Thematic analysis of focus group transcripts revealed that, while women valued and preferred vaginal birth, all feared the ""unknown"" of vaginal delivery and some perceived that their care provider or family would not support VBAC.
Conclusion: The pamphlet increased women's knowledge of the risks and benefits of mode of delivery and may be an effective tool for informing women of their options for birth after caesarean. The pamphlet did not impact women's intentions to plan a VBAC. Our findings may encourage the development of interventions to reduce women's fear of vaginal birth and to educate women's family members about the risks and benefits of VBAC. Improving women's knowledge of their options is a necessary first step in improving care and outcomes after caesarean."

For those who are precariously employed, effects have included reduced work hours and lost incomes. This includes workers in employment that is insecure, low-waged, with little or no benefits, and/or non-unionized. Precarious work is an important yet underexamined determinant negatively affecting the physical and mental health of workers, with potential long-term effects. Occupational hazards, limited access to social and health benefits (including sick days), low incomes, and social isolation are among factors contributing to poor health outcomes. Racialized, women, and immigrant workers are more likely to be employed precariously creating a critical health equity concern. A significant proportion of workers vital to the Canadian economy and health system are employed precariously, including 38 percent of workers in British Columbia. There is a need to understand how the pandemic affected precarious work as a determinant of health. This research will specifically examine how precarious work affected the health of Black people in British Columbia since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Black population faces higher levels of unemployment and precarious work attributable to historical and ongoing barriers. Using interviews to learn from lived experiences and personal circumstances, it will examine how factors such as race, gender, and immigration status uniquely contribute to experiences of workers. The study will inform a broader understanding of the impacts of precarious work on the health of marginalized groups. Outcomes will inform pandemic recovery efforts to build back better by extending opportunities to achieve health equity while preparing for future health crises."
Addiction Detection for a Diverse Canada: Developing socially responsible machine learning models to minimize gambling harms.,"['Murch, William S']",['N/A'],"['Detection', 'Discrimination', 'Gambling Disorder', 'Machine Learning', 'Marginalization', 'Medical Inequality', 'Online Gambling', 'Prevention', 'Public Health', 'Treatment Disparity']",90000.0,455199,"Some people who gamble experience an addiction similar people who use alcohol or drugs. In order for us to provide the right tools to prevent gambling problems from becoming an addiction, we need a method for predicting when people are at-risk.
Using machine learning models, we previously developed a successful method for identifying at-risk gamblers using their betting patterns on several gambling websites. Although these ""Risk Detection Models"" (RDMs) did a great job overall, we noticed that they struggled to make accurate predictions about several groups of people who have been historically disadvantaged in Canadian society: women, younger adults, and people experiencing unemployment or poverty.
We aim to improve the fairness of RDM predictions so that our harm prevention efforts are not biased against people who have been marginalized in Canada. This effort will fit inside a larger research programme where our RDMs are being developed, statistically evaluated, and implemented in the real-world.
Our first project will migrate our existing RDMs to a live online gambling website, revalidating and updating them with new participant samples. During this study, we will also be testing several different ways of preventing addiction in at-risk people. Crucially, we will look at how the models perform with people of different ages, genders, ethnicities, and economic backgrounds to develop methods for achieving equitable prediction accuracy and harm prevention within these groups.
Our second project will involve interviewing online gamblers to understand how they feel about machine learning and our RDMs. We want to make sure that our final system is socially acceptable and does not make people from different backgrounds feel like their freedom, dignity, or privacy have been hurt.
When the research is over, we will deliver a system that helps prevent gambling addictions. We will then write about our methods, so that other provinces and countries can recreate our work."
Assessing the impact of cytomegalovirus infection on prognosis and survival of aerodigestive tract cancers based on Ontario data,"['Murison, Kiera R']",['N/A'],"['Cancer', 'Cytomegalovirus Infection', 'Head And Neck Cancer', 'Humans', 'Lung Cancer', 'Prognosis', 'Survival']",105000.0,496541,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is highly common around the world, and it's estimated that 25-65% of the Canadian population is infected. The immune system is unable to clear CMV and research shows this leaves individuals who already have compromised immune systems, such as people living with HIV and the elderly, at increased risk of death. Previous work shows that CMV infection in blood cancer patients can be associated with poor survival, but little work has focused on CMV infection in aerodigestive tract cancers (lung and head and neck (HNC) cancers). Due to the poor survival rate and heavy burden of aerodigestive tract cancers and the high rate of CMV infection amongst Canadians, research into CMV as it affects prognosis and survival is important to provide optimal patient management at the time of diagnosis.

My goal is to examine the effect of CMV infection on survival of patients with aerodigestive tract cancers. I will do this by examining how survival is impacted by CMV infection and by type of cancer (i.e., where cancer is located in the lung or head and neck).

To achieve these aims, epidemiological data, blood samples, and clinical outcomes data on lung and HNCs recruited from Princess Margaret Hospital will be used to evaluate the impact of CMV infection. I will then report 5-year and 10-year survival estimates and estimate how survival changes when cancer patients are infected with CMV.

I will be able to work with patient groups and clinical partners to better understand how my findings will affect patients and their families and work with clinical partners.

CMV is highly present within the population, but CMV is under-studied and public awareness is lacking. The results of my work have clinical actionability because it's possible to treat CMV with anti-viral therapy. With enough data on how CMV affects survival of aerodigestive tract cancer patients, we can screen patients for CMV infection at diagnosis and improve patient management strategies."

This Knowledge to Action grant will enable intersectoral stakeholders in Toronto to respond to the WHO call to action, and to set a global example as a city that is integrating research and community knowledge to reduce health inequities. Our team comprises highly experienced health and human service planners and internationally recognized health equity researchers. With CIHR funding, we will adapt, implement, and evaluate the WHO Urban HEART to reduce health inequities in Toronto. Urban HEART (Urban Health Equity Assessment and Response Tool is a novel KT tool that links evidence-based health equity assessment directly to evidence-based health equity interventions. (This link, which creates actionable evidence is badly needed to move from measuring health inequities to reducing them). The need for actionable evidence to guide intersectoral action on health equity is a CIHR priority. It is also a priority in Toronto.  An evidence-based approach will help us to understand where, why, and how our diverse efforts are (or are not) reducing health inequities. Toronto`s demographic profile, particularly our high levels of immigration and ethno-cultural-racial diversity, may represent the future for many cities in post-industrial countries. Our experiences in managing sociocultural integration and protecting health and social equity across diverse groups can be an important guide for other cities. CIHR investment in this process will help stakeholders in Canada and around the world better understand pathways to health equity."

Lifetime effects of weight and weight related health conditions on healthy aging and maintenance of autonomy,"['Murphy, Rachel']",['N/A'],"['Effects Of Obesity', 'Function And Autonomy', 'Geriatric Epidemiology', 'Healthy Aging']",140000.0,247392,"Currently 4.8 million Canadians are over 65 years of age and by 2026, more than one out of every five Canadians will be over 65.  This represents a major shift in demographics and emphasizes the importance of understanding factors that influence healthy aging and maintenance of independence.  Already more than 2.5 million Canadians over 65 report having more than one chronic health condition.  Of this 2.5 million, half report moderate to severe disability.  The trend towards increasingly heavy body weights in Canada may also impact disability and intensify the problem.  However, studies on the relationship between weight, body composition (amount of muscle and adipose) and disability have largely been confined to one time point and limited measures of function.  As a result, many questions remain about critical periods during lifetime for risk associated with obesity, chronic disease, and the subsequent impact on healthy aging.  Using comprehensive lifetime data on weight, body composition and function from several major population studies comprising over 12,000 older men and women, we propose to determine the impact of health conditions and a lifetime of obesity on function and health outcomes in old age.  Potential novel associations between function, inflammatory markers, genetic markers and telomere length will also be investigated.  It is hypothesized that maintenance of non-obese body weight over the lifetime will be most closely associated with healthy aging (fewer health conditions, lower levels of inflammation, greater function and quality of life).  Although life expectancy in Canada has increased, this has not been equaled by an increase in disability-free life expectancy.  This research will contribute to our understanding of factors which impact upon function and health outcomes in old age and may lead to new approaches to make these later years as healthy and productive as possible."

Dietary guidelines are meant to support healthy eating and overall health but largely use a 'one-size-fits all' approach. This does not consider the many individual and population-level factors that shape dietary intake nor the complexity of food itself. There are also differences in how a person's body responds to foods and nutrients that influence maintenance of health and prevention of disease. Dietary guidelines also put an emphasis on an individual to make healthy choices but are out of reach for many Canadians. In order to drive meaningful change in dietary intake and the health of Canadians, we need to better understand these differences in a group of diverse Canadians. In this project we will draw on Canada's largest source of dietary intake; the HEAL study that is collecting dietary data from 130,000 people across Canada including diversity in ethnic, cultural, gender, income and education. We will 1) use state-of-the-art methods to measure how processed foods are in the food supply and in individuals' diets and 2) embrace differences at the individual and population-level to understand how differences contribute to dietary intake. We will then study the dietary factors from aims 1 and 2 in relation to measures of metabolic health, and markers of metabolism to understand how dietary factors drive differences in health. Our findings will contribute important information on factors that could be modified to better support the health of Canadians and new ways to tailor dietary guidance that meet people where they are."

However, in order to drive meaningful improvements in the dietary intake of Canadians, we need to gain a better understanding of how environments support healthy eating. The aims of this project are to 1) describe how dietary intake is linked with aspects of the food environment like how accessible healthy foods are within communities, provinces and across Canada, 2) examine how links between dietary intake and the food environment group with other environmental factors like how walkable a neighbourhood is and factors known to influence chronic disease risk such as physical activity, income and education. To accomplish these aims, we will collect data on diet, physical activity and other health factors with user-friendly online tools in a large study of men and women across 8 provinces; the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow Project (CanPath) and connect with NutriQuébec, an ongoing cohort collecting similar data. CanPath and NutriQuébec, are linked to nation-wide environment data including measures of the food, social and built environments, creating a rich data source to explore our novel research questions.

"Comparing the nutritional content of foods and beverages marketed to children and adults, respectively in Canada.","['Murray, Chelsea']",['N/A'],"['Food And Beverage Marketing To Children', 'Measuring Parental Attitudes Toward Marketing To Children', ""Nutritional Content Of Children'S Foods""]",17500.0,279436,"Childhood obesity is growing quickly in Canada, leading to serious health issues like heart disease and type II diabetes, and high costs to the Canadian healthcare system. There is a common belief that foods and drinks marketed to children are less healthy than similar adult foods. Food marketing affects children's food choices and requests for food to their parents, leading Canadian nutrition experts to suggest the government should ban the marketing of unhealthy foods to children. However, in Canada, there has never been a detailed look into how healthy children's foods actually are. I believe that foods directed at children are less healthy than similar products for adults, and that the marketing of children's products affects what parents buy for their children. To determine if children's foods are less healthy than similar adult products, I will classify all of the products in a database of Canadian food packages as being marketed to either children or adults, and compare their characteristics, including the number of calories, and amounts of fat, sugar, salt, and other nutrients to see if there are differences between products for children and adults. I will also play a major role in updating this food label database with new products in 2013, and examine patterns in food marketing to children over time.  Finally, to see how food marketing to children influences parents' purchase patterns, I will conduct a survey on parents' attitudes about food marketing to children and their food purchasing habits. By looking at how healthy children's foods are and how parents are influenced by food marketing to children, my research will provide data to help develop Canadian policies to promote healthy weights for children. Looking at patterns over time in children's foods will show whether a ban on the marketing unhealthy foods to children would be an appropriate strategy to prevent childhood obesity in Canada."
DDT and Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy in South Africa,"['Murray, Jennifer B']",['N/A'],"['Ddt/Dde', 'Hypertension', 'Hypertensive Disorders Of Pregnancy', 'Indoor Residual Spraying', 'Insecticides', 'Malaria', 'Maternal Health', 'Preeclampsia', 'Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension', 'South Africa']",2500.0,324558,"Although banned in Western countries since the 1970s, DDT insecticide (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) is used in 11 countries for Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) programs to control mosquitoes that carry malaria. More than 120 million people around the world are exposed to IRS insecticides. Recent studies on humans and animals suggest that DDT could increase the risk of hypertension. However, no study has investigated whether DDT could increase the risk of the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), which are a leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in most countries where IRS is used. Our aim was to determine whether serum concentrations of DDT and its main breakdown product, DDE, are associated with preeclampsia, blood pressure, and protein in urine among pregnant women. We evaluated 751 mother-infant pairs from South Africa and used data from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences-funded Venda Health Examination of Mothers, Babies and their Environment (VHEMBE), a cohort study following mother-infant pairs from birth. Blood samples were taken from all participants at the time of delivery to determine concentrations of DDT and DDE. Data on the diagnosis of HDP (preeclampsia, eclampsia or pregnancy-induced hypertension) was collected using a questionnaire and blood pressure was abstracted from medical records. We found that every 10-fold increase in maternal DDT and DDE concentrations was associated with a 47% and 53% elevated risk of hypertension, preeclampsia or eclampsia, respectively. While elevated concentrations of DDT and DDE were associated with higher blood pressure measurements and protein in urine, these results were not statistically significant. Results therefore suggest that DDT and DDE exposure may increase the risk of HDP. This is the first study investigating this question in an IRS area. Results will contribute to the risk-benefit analysis of DDT use for malaria control by national and international organizations."

Preterm birth can have long-lasting impacts on the infant, the mother, and their families. In British Columbia (BC), the preterm birth rates among Indigenous women are twice as high as non-Indigenous women. A First Nations community on Vancouver Island, BC, has identified an even higher preterm birth rate: in this community, preterm birth rates are three times higher than non-Indigenous women. The reason for these high rates of preterm birth is not known. As a PhD Candidate, I propose to work with leaders at Island Health, a health authority in BC, to find solutions to this high rate of preterm birth. Our primary goal is to reduce the occurence of preterm birth in both the Cowichan Valley Region and in other communities across Canada. To accomplish this, we will pursue the following objectives: 1) review medical records to determine risk factors for preterm birth; 2) review data about Indigenous women's perspectives on risk factors for preterm birth; 3) develop strategies to reduce preterm birth in the Cowichan Valley Region; 4) work with local First Nations communities and Island Health to implement our strategies; and 5) publish evidence-based solutions to improve health systems that can reduce preterm birth among Indigenous women in Canada. While there has been great concern about high rates of preterm birth among Indigenous women, this will be the first study to turn research into actionable solutions for health systems. An advisory committee - composed of representatives from all First Nations communities in the Cowichan Valley Region, as well as Island Health and other health system partners - will guide all of our work."

Our main objective is to identify the proportion of older PLWH that can live independently and autonomously, and the factors that enable them to achieve these goals. In addition, the team will: assess the current health status of this population, considering multiple domains of well-being (physical, mental, cognitive, social, sexual, and financial); explore their current met and unmet health and social service needs, as well as their anticipated future needs. We will analyze the impact of age, sex, gender, race/ethnicity, length of time living with HIV, and geographic location on holistic health, access to services, and ability to live independently and make their own decisions; and determine their preparedness to address their needs as they grow older.

Older adults with frailty are vulnerable to catastrophic decreases in their health from minor stressors, which can lead to hospitalization or death.
There is increasing evidence that aging can be positively altered such that frailty and disease is delayed or prevented. Many of the causes of frailty are preventable, including muscle loss, poor nutrition, and loneliness. Our research focuses on implementing a city-wide, population-based healthy-aging strategy called AVOID Frailty. AVOID Frailty promotes regular Activity and exercise, adult Vaccinations, Optimization of medications, regular social Interaction, and improved Diet and nutrition. AVOID Frailty proposes behaviour-change methods to educate, encourage and help people adopt and maintain these behaviours over time.  
Our project will identify the community barriers and facilitators that are responsible for people's adoption of AVOID Frailty behaviours in cities like Kingston and Trois-Rivières. Our plan is to first identify all community care and social programs available to community members to maintain their health and include them in the AVOID Frailty strategy. We will then consult older adults and city representatives and from community organizations to study how AVOID Frailty can be further tailored to the needs of older adults who live in various types of residences. In a last step, we will assess the extent to which adoption of the AVOID Frailty behaviours improves the well-being and quality of life of older adults. Our findings will allow us to evaluate the effectiveness of this tailoring strategy in meeting older adults' needs, and implement it in other Canadian cities so that older adults can live longer in good health and with high quality of life."

Tackling health inequalities and extending working lives (THRIVE),"['Mustard, Cameron A']","['Tompa, Emile']","['Extending Working Lives', 'Population Health', 'Socioeconomic Inequalities']",250000.0,331770,"In Europe and Canada, policymakers are facing particular challenges related to rising life expectancy, a shift in the age profile of the population and the consequent increase in the prevalence of chronic illness and disability. But these increases in life expectancy are not experienced equally. Less skilled workers, for example, have a shorter life expectancy, earlier onset of chronic illness and disability, are more likely to suffer multi-morbidities as they get older and enjoy fewer years of life after retirement.  Policymakers in Europe and Canada therefore face a dual challenge of extending health, quality of life and wellbeing into old age for all groups, whilst finding more effective and equitable ways of ensuring that all older people are fairly treated in strategies and policies to extend working life.

Current activity recommendations have focused on promoting total levels of PA and reducing total or bouts of SB (e.g., accumulating 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity on most days and minimizing total SB). However, the movements of adults are usually variable and can be accumulated in numerous bouts and breaks of PA and SB. Furthermore, the relationship between the variation in these patterns and their health effects are not well understood. Adults spend the majority of their wakeful hours at work; therefore, the workplace provides an important setting to explore movement behaviours. A worker's movement patterns including PA and SB can be influenced by work demands, as well as the social and environmental context at work. A detailed exploration of typical movement patterns of workers is needed to inform practical recommendations that can be implemented in actual working situations. This project will leverage objectively measured Canadian population-level data to provide a novel exploration of the typical movement patterns of workers at work and outside of work and their effects on cardiometabolic health. We will analyse data from the five cycles of the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS; 2007 to 2017). Movement patterns include different movement behaviours (light-, moderate-, vigorous-intensity physical activity, and sedentary behaviour) at work and outside of work. Associations between movement patterns and cardiometabolic risk markers will also be explored. Our project fills an unexplored gap in our understanding of how movements are accumulated by Canadians in free-living conditions at their jobs and how they influence overall movements, and in turn cardiometabolic health.  The project is also novel in its use of cluster analysis to identify groups of work and non-work patterns through similar and dissimilar movements and durations."

Much of the global burden of tobacco use is concentrated in low and middle income countries (LMICs), such as India and Bangladesh, which collectively have more than 300 million tobacco users. Smokeless tobacco use is disproportionately concentrated in these countries and unlike most other countries, smokeless tobacco accounts for a greater proportion of tobacco use than smoked forms such as cigarettes. Knowledge of the health risks of smokeless tobacco remains low, to the extent that it continues to be used for medicinal purposes in some communities. 

Health warnings on tobacco packages are among the most cost-effective interventions to reduce tobacco use at the population level. There is an urgent need for evidence to guide the effective design of smokeless tobacco health warnings and their implementation in the face of industry legal challenges. However, both research and labelling practices are considerably more advanced for cigarettes compared to smokeless tobacco, and it is unclear how contextual factors, such as lower literacy rates and cultural differences in perceptions of disease and imagery, may affect the impact of pictorial health warnings for smokeless tobacco products.

The study will examine 1) the effeciveness of individual health warnings for each of the five leading health effects of smokeless tobacco (oral cancer, mouth disease, heart disease, addiction, and death), 2) the effectiveness of different health effects (e.g., oral cancer vs. heart disease), and 3) the effectiveness of pictorial ""themes"" (e.g., graphic vs. symbolic imagery) in India and Bangladesh.

This research has the potential to address a key evidence gap in tobacco labelling and will provide regulators with a set of empirically tested health warnings and the evidence to support their implementation."

Those efforts are called population health interventions.  Research on population health interventions has been limited because it has not looked carefully at how context affects population health interventions.  To prepare for the grant application we will develop a conceptual framework for how the social sciences (1) understand context and (2) can work together with public health researchers on population health interventions.  We will apply that framework in our grant application which explores how understanding and researching context from a social science perspective can improve population health interventions.
Investigating the impacts of alcohol-sales deregulation on emergency department visits and hospitalizations due to alcohol in the province of Ontario,"['Myran, Daniel']",['N/A'],"['Alcohol And Drug Policy', 'Population Health', 'Public Health', 'Substance Use Disorders']",165000.0,412445,"Problematic alcohol use is responsible for a large and growing burden on the health of Canadians. Prior research has identified possible regulations that governments can put in place to reduce problematic alcohol use and associated health harms. One frequently identified regulation is placing limits on the location and number of stores that can sell alcohol. However, several questions about the effect of this regulation exist including its causality, (i.e. whether having more stores cause individuals to consume more alcohol, or if more stores open in response to there being a high demand for alcohol by the individuals living in the region?), and if the number of stores impact the alcohol consumption of important groups differently (i.e. men and women, young and old, low- and high-income). The purpose of this research is to better investigate the relationship between the availability of alcohol stores and health harms. To do so we will take advantage of a change in government policy in the province of Ontario and the availability of high-quality data on health care visits. Starting in December 2015 two successive Ontario governments have made large changes to how alcohol is sold in Ontario including increasing the number of stores and their permitted hours of operation. This research will collect the location and hours of operation of all stores selling alcohol in Ontario before, during, and after these policy changes. We will then link this data into databases containing records of all emergency department visits and hospitalizations in Ontario and see whether individuals who live near a store selling alcohol are more likely to have an ED visit or hospitalization caused by alcohol. We will also examine this relationship for different demographic groups. We plan to work with health and government officials at the local, provincial, and national level to communicate the results of our research and help inform policy related to regulating how and where we sell alcohol."
Informing the design of public health campaigns: Does reducing anti-fat bias by using non-stereotypical images promote physical activity in individuals with obesity?,"['Myre, Maxine']",['N/A'],"['Body Mass Index', 'Cardiorespiratory Fitness', 'Dual Processing', 'Media', 'Mixed-Methods', 'Physical Activity', 'Public Health Campaigns', 'Qualitative', 'Quantitative', 'Stigmatization']",150000.0,339621,"Most Canadians are aware that being physically active is an important part of their health. Yet, about four in five Canadian adults do not meet Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines. In addition, while obesity rates in Canada have been growing, individuals who are obese but fit are at a lower risk of mortality than those who are thin but unfit.

Still, obese individuals are commonly stigmatized in the media. In news photographs for example, obese individuals are less likely to be shown exercising or wearing professional clothing than normal weight individuals, and are more likely to have their heads cut out of the photo/video or be shown eating or drinking.

These types of photos reinforce anti-fat stereotypes. Obese individuals may accept anti-fat stereotypes about themselves and consequently avoid physical activity. This is a major public health challenge because it is difficult for public health campaigns to compete for attention in such a media-rich environment.

This research will determine if perceptions related to obesity (anti-fat stereotypes) can be modified to increase physical activity in obese persons.

Perceptions can be changed by associating words like 'strong', 'athletic' and 'motivated' with images of people with obesity. It is expected that repeated exposure to counter-stereotypical images will reduce anti-fat bias and increase physical activity in individuals with obesity.

There is currently a lack of research that identifies ways to reduce the stigma of obesity. The results of this research could aid in designing public health campaigns that promote the health benefits of physical activity for individuals at every weight. Plus, a lack of physical activity is associated with the development of diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. Therefore, improving rates of physical activity, no matter the BMI, would improve the health of Canadians and decrease the financial burden on the Canadian health care system."

Le soutien social de leur réseau, entre autres, influencera le développement et/ou le maintien de leur trouble. Mais par quels mécanismes ce soutien agit-il? Quelques écrits suggèrent que le soutien social affecterait, entre autres, la réactivité physiologique des individus aux prises avec un tel trouble, qui, à son tour, affecterait les symptômes d'ÉSPT de ces mêmes personnes. Ainsi, je tenterais de vérifier ces suggestions par: (a) des mesures du soutien social à l'aide de questionnaires et d'observations d'interactions sociales en laboratoire, (b) des mesures des symptômes d'ÉSPT par des questionnaires et des entrevues cliniques et (c) des mesures de réactivité physiologique au moyen d'électrodes.

Indigenous Elders' Lodge: Treaty 7 Elders' exploration of the role of traditional Gender Roles on Wellness,"['Naclia, Janet']",['N/A'],"['Ceremony And Protocol', 'Culture', 'Gender And Wellness', 'Indigenous Elders', 'Land Based Teaching', 'Social Impact Lab', 'Spirituality', 'Traditional Gender Roles']",75000.0,412340,"For this project, Alberta Recreation and Parks Association (ARPA) will work in collaboration with United Way of Calgary and Area to support a Treaty 7 Elders' discussion around the connections between traditional gender role and wellness. This discussion will be part of the emerging Indigenous Elders Lodge in Calgary whose mandate is to help bridge gaps in cultural understanding as well as enable knowledge transfer to the next generation through the use of Indigenous and Western system parallels.

The Indigenous Elders' Lodge project will highlight teachings centred on gendered perspectives surrounding ceremony, protocol, and traditional land-based activities as well as knowledge transfer in an Indigenous context as related to impacts on wellness.

Alberta Health's Service's 2016 report, ""Addiction and Mental Health: The Indigenous Patient Journey Project"" states that those who no longer needed the support of Addiction and Mental Health Services claim that one of the most change-influencing circumstance was a connection to culture and spirituality. The idea of healing, however, is not only an individual process but also a social one, implying the need for safe environments that will enable healthy relationships. 

This interconnectedness to others but also to nature and to culture is a vital concept underlying the foundations of Indigenous identity. This identity is seen as a complex interrelationship built upon collective values and shared belief systems focusing on history, ceremony, and the land. The Indigenous Elders' Lodge project will allow Elders in Treaty 7 to explore these concepts in a safe and ethical space with a particular focus on how traditional constructions of gender affected wellness in the past with the goal of deciding how (or if) these learnings should be brought forward into the present and even into the future."
Epidemiology and impact of myalgic encephalomyelitis and chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) in Canada: A multi-centre population-based study,"['Nacul, Luis']","['Chuluunbaatar, Enkhzaya', 'Kerr, Kathleen J', 'Robertson, Hilary']","['Long-Covid', 'Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (Me/Cfs)']",100000.0,504834,"Myalgic encephalomyelitis (also known as chronic fatigue syndrome or ME/CFS) is a disabling illness. The causes of ME/CFS are not well understood. Getting a diagnosis can be challenging, and there are limited effective treatments. Patients report barriers to care and many unmet health needs. The true burden of ME/CFS is unknown but has increased since the COVID-19 pandemic. This is because some people develop persistent symptoms after COVID-19 infection (also known as Long COVID). Some Long COVID cases are indistinguishable from ME/CFS. Data on ME/CFS in Canada are scarce. Without this data, issues for people with ME/CFS persist.

This project will accelerate the collection and understanding of data on ME/CFS. The goal is to characterize the ME/CFS population and evaluate their unmet needs. Our analysis includes people with ME/CFS due to Long COVID. First, we will produce an accurate database of people with ME/CFS using multiple methods. Second, we will estimate the number of people living with ME/CFS in Canada. Third, we will compare ME/CFS ""cases"" with controls. Fourth, we will investigate healthcare needs, inequities, and access to care for people with ME/CFS. We will use a national database called CanPath to access data from 3 provinces: British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec. We will use standardized questionnaires to confirm the diagnosis of ME/CFS. We will compare disease severity and quality of life between ME/CFS cases and controls. We will also compare pre-pandemic ME/CFS cases with COVID-19-related cases of ME/CFS. We will also describe the journey people take to find health care and public services. The project includes people with lived experience of ME/CFS and Long COVID.

The findings will provide a better understanding of the severity and burden of ME/CFS in Canada. This will be meaningful for the assessment and planning of health services. This will inform the development of needs-based health policies and interventions."

Since 2016, the per-person opioid overdose mortality rate has increased by a staggering 117%, causing a devastating impact on the health and lives of many Canadians. In response to this crisis, which has worsened due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its measures, a new harm reduction strategy called ""safer supply"" has been introduced and integrated into existing harm reduction services in select sites across Canada. Safer supply programs provide prescribed medications as a safer alternative to the toxic illegal drug supply. However, evidence on how these programs benefit people who use drugs is limited including information on access barriers and program engagement experiences. In this study, I will assess the effectiveness of integrated safer supply programs in reducing overdose rates and improving the health and social well-being of people who use drugs, who access these services. I will also identify the challenges and barriers to accessing these programs, including how well they are able to meet the needs of people who use drugs. To do this, I will link behavioural data collected over time from a cohort of people who use drugs in Toronto with administrative datasets that include comprehensive clinical data. Findings from my study will guide future uptake and expansion of safer supply programs in Canada. It will also provide information that will help improve access to and quality of harm reduction services for people who use drugs."
Leading research in activity and aging: Identifying research priorities of the Canadian Centre for Activity and Aging through a co-designed symposium,"['Nagamatsu, Lindsay S']","['Orange, Joseph B']","['Aging', 'Physical Activity', 'Research Priorities', 'Symposium']",9909.0,468159,"Physical activity is the most impactful activity that we can engage in to support physiological, mental, and cognitive health, especially as we age. Evidence suggests that physical activity is associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, stroke), improved mental health (e.g., mood, depression, anxiety), and better brain health (e.g., brain structure and function, reduced risk of dementia). Combined, these benefits from physical activity increase quality of life and independence among older adults, and result in reduced morbidity and mortality.

Research in physical activity and aging covers many different fields, ranging from exercise physiology to health promotion to rehabilitation and more. We also recognize that there are activities outside of the ""physical"" domain that play an important role in the aging process, including cognitive and social activities, and activities as they relate to daily functions. Collectively, research on activities in older adults furthers our understanding of the aging process and identifies ways to promote healthy aging for those in our communities.

Therefore, we propose to host a two-day symposium on Activity and Aging at Western University in London Ontario that will serve to identify research priorities, create collaborative opportunities between researchers who examine activity and aging, identify opportunities to facilitate research, and to provide training opportunities for students. 

Our symposium will include participants from research (i.e., faculty), community partners (i.e., older adults living in London Ontario), and students (i.e., graduate trainees). Through our planned activities (research presentations, group brainstorming sessions, and networking opportunities), we seek to identify and strengthen research that will transform the aging process for Canadians."
Structured exercise as a potential treatment option for prenatal depression,"['Nagpal, Taniya S']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,400496,"Up to 20% of women experience depression during pregnancy and approximately 19% will continue to have feelings of depression after delivery. Most women will choose not to have prescribed medication for depression during pregnancy. Untreated prenatal depression significantly increases the risk for postpartum depression. Previous research supports exercise during pregnancy as a way to prevent prenatal depression, however exercise as a potential treatment for women who enter pregnancy at risk for depression has not been studied. Therefore the purpose of this study was to determine if exercise during pregnancy is an effective option to treat depression during pregnancy. This study took place in Madrid, Spain. Women <16 weeks pregnant were randomly placed in an exercise group (EG) or standard prenatal care (no exercise intervention) control group (CG). The EG participated in group fitness classes three times per week. All participants completed the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale (CES-D) at the beginning and at the end of the program (36-38 weeks gestation). A score greater than or equal to 16 on the CES-D indicates risk for depression. Thirty-six women in the EG and 25 women in the CG scored above 16 on the CES-D at the beginning of the program. At the end of the program, the EG had a significantly lower CES-D score (14.4±8.6) than the CG (19.4±11.1; p<0.05). Furthermore, the EG average CES-D score was below 16 at the end of the intervention, meaning they are out of the at risk category, whereas the score remained above 16 for the CG.  More women in the EG had a score that decreased (n=30, 83.3%) than the CG (n=14, 56%; p<0.05). The results of this study show that a structured exercise program offered during pregnancy may be a treatment option among women who begin pregnancy already at risk for prenatal depression. Exercise may be better received by women than medication for reducing symptoms of depression during pregnancy."

Contaminants in First Nations communities have long been a concern, with significant impacts for both human health and the environment. These pollutants such as heavy metals, pesticides, and industrial chemicals, have been found in various environmental sources, leading to health issues such as cancer, respiratory illness, and developmental problems. First Nations peoples face heightened vulnerabilities to the adverse effects of environmental pollution due to their heavy reliance on local natural resources, gender disparities, limited health care access, gender, and language barriers. This research encompasses two projects that investigate the environmental exposures, socio-cultural vulnerabilities, and health impacts from industrial pollution in northern First Nations.

Though physical activity interventions in youth are increasing in Canada, few have shown potential to have long term positive benefits for all children in Canada.  Using the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) of motivation, this research project will examine whether the ways in which schools in Vancouver implement the Daily Physical Activity initiative (DPA) - a province-wide, school-based policy intervention - affects student motivation, level of enjoyment, and participation in physical activity.  Previous findings from SDT indicate that promoting independence or choice can increase motivation to perform a behaviour as well as influence enjoyment towards the behaviour.  Therefore, this study will examine whether students who feel they have more choice in setting their activities at school will participate more frequently in physical activity outside of school. Our research team is in a unique position to perform this study as we currently have data from a previous project on the implementation of DPA across British Columbia. It is imperative that schools promote enjoyment and foster motivation to be active, as once students graduate from high-school it is these factors that are believed to dictate their physical activity behaviours. Childhood obesity continues to put a burden on the Canadian healthcare system through associated health complications such as Type II Diabetes and Cardiovascular Disease. As such, finding the most effective ways to prevent childhood obesity will, both in the short term and the long term, help all Canadians."

The way to end TB is to prevent it from happening in the first place, addressing the root causes - the social determinants of TB. The root causes are poverty, education, housing, food security, employment, and working conditions. Whereas we know plenty about the social determinants of TB, there is little known about the social determinants of multidrug-resistant TB. The Sikkim state of India has one of the lowest rates of TB in the country, but the highest rates of multidrug-resistant -TB.

Prosocial behavior and longevity in older adults: Identifying underlying mediators and key moderators,"['Nakamura, Julia S']",['N/A'],"['Causal Inference', 'Epidemiology', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Psychology', 'Health/Well-Being', 'Mediation', 'Moderation', 'Older Adults', 'Prosocial Behavior', 'Volunteering']",150000.0,457608,"In Canada, life expectancy has stagnated and years lost to disability have increased. Further, healthcare spending, which reached $264.4 billion in 2019, is projected to continue escalating. This is partly attributable to the rapidly rising older adult population because as people age, the prevalence and burden of chronic disease (and associated costs) increases. Thus, researchers and policymakers are seeking ways to enhance our population's health and well-being. Fostering higher volunteer rates is a promising path to achieving this goal. In addition to benefitting communities (volunteers contribute ~18 billion CAD to the economy annually), growing evidence suggests that volunteering is consistently associated with a reduced risk of mortality. However, underlying mechanisms, and the factors moderating this connection are unclear. The proposed research is relevant to public health because evaluating how volunteering is associated with a range of behavioral-, physical-, and psychosocial-mechanisms will move the field forward by building the scientific case for a causal relationship between increased volunteering and enhanced health, providing new directions for developing broader volunteering programs, policies, and interventions that will effectively enhance the health and well-being of our rapidly aging population. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to CIHR's mission, which is to create new scientific knowledge and to enable its translation into improved health, more effective health services and products, and a strengthened Canadian health care system."

Only a handful of studies have explored issues related to HIV and Asian men who have sex with men (MSM) in Canada. The limited data suggest that Asian MSM, particularly less acculturated immigrant men, appear to be at greater risk for contracting HIV as they are more likely to engage in unprotected anal and oral sex. U.S. studies have also found that Asian MSM have high rates of unprotected anal intercourse and sex under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Asian MSM in Canada are also at risk because they do not seek early HIV testing. Compared to other racial groups in the U.S., Asians were more likely to be at an advanced stage of AIDS and have opportunistic infections at the time of diagnosis. A significantly lower percentage of HIV-positive Asians were aware of their current CD4 count and they were less aware of care-related services compared to Whites, which puts HIV-positive Asians at a disadvantage in terms of survival. This study will explore risk factors of Asian Canadian MSM for contracting HIV and examine attitudes toward and barriers to HIV testing among Asian MSM through focus groups. Community based participatory research will be utilized through collaboration with the Asian Society for the Intervention of AIDS (ASIA) and other community based HIV organizations in Vancouver, BC to determine what service providers' and staff view as the greatest needs for HIV prevention in their community. Community members will also be recruited to participate in focus groups about what Asian Canadian MSM perceive as strengths and limitations to current HIV prevention and what needs they have as a community. The data from the focus groups will guide the development of research questions for future quantitative data collection. These data will inform the development of culturally appropriate HIV-prevention interventions for Asian Canadian MSM."

This project asks how semiotics can help us think differently, given these demographic changes, about how to move forward in the work of HIV/AIDS prevention and service delivery. 
     The project involves innovation with semiotics as a new theory and method in HIV/AIDS, and thinking about how to train community members in this framework. As a catalyst grant, it involves some experimentation, and will include sustained reflection on how this experimental work can help inform the development of a more elaborate research protocol in this area."

The research was supported by a CIHR Operating Grant (2013-18). This project included interviews with individuals active in the response to HIV/AIDS in Montréal's Haitian communities, as well as substantive archival research. It has resulted in the production of a book-length manuscript, which offers an in-depth and sustained analysis of the impact of HIV/AIDS in Montréal's Haitian communities, as well as the response of members of that community to this public health challenge. There is no other research which documents this reality in the Canadian context. As such, this research offers a unique opportunity to learn from the history of HIV/AIDS. The proposed grant includes three major activities to disseminate this knowledge : 1) the publication of a book, to educate both scholars (historians of Montréal) and the general public ; 2) the delivery of five workshops in Haitian community-based organizations to educate the local Haitian community; 3) a series of Creole-language radio advertisements to disseminate the learning from this history in a relevant format that will reach a large number of Haitian Montréalers."

However, our ability to improve population health and reduce health inequalities is limited:  we do not yet understand well enough how public policies and programs can be used to influence these social determinants of health. Rigorously assessing the impact of interventions, from national policies to smaller-scale programs, has become an active area of inquiry in social sciences such as economics, but less so in epidemiology. This research program will fill this gap by systematically identifying and evaluating evidence-based interventions that can improve population health and promote health equity in a global context. Countries are constantly designing and implementing policies and programs. By systematically grouping countries together and carefully analyzing comparable similarities or differences in implementation and outcomes, we can achieve a far better understanding of what public policies and programs really make a difference to the health of individuals. As the world moves towards the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015, there is as a new set of targets to meet that will improve health and reduce health inequality worldwide, and an outstanding window of opportunity to generate new evidence to meet them. This program focuses particularly on policies related to socioeconomic status, health services, public health, and the environment, and identifies the effects on the health-related SDGs of different policy variations across nations (Aim 1); within nations that have substantial policy variation at the provincial or state level (Aim 2); and in terms of their cost-effectiveness (Aim 3). The program will develop partnerships with policymakers, non-governmental organizations, and intergovernmental institutions to develop relevant research questions and ensure that research results inform the development of effective policies and programs on the ground."

Promoting access to quality sexual, reproductive, and maternal health services is an important mechanism for accelerating progress toward Sustainable Development Goal targets for reductions in maternal and newborn death. Out-of- pocket costs represent a substantial barrier to access to maternal and reproductive health services, particularly among poorer households, in India. In 2008, the Government of India launched the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY) health insurance scheme to improve access to health services for families below the poverty line, and later expanded to cover unorganized workers. The program provides eligible families with cashless healthcare for inpatient health services, capped at INR 30,000 (USD 500) annually. This includes certain sexual and reproductive health services, such as insertion of an intrauterine device; a maternal care package including antenatal care, diagnostics, and delivery; and neonatal care for newborns admitted with complications. In this study, we will use information collected from three district-representative household surveys to evaluate the impact of expanded access to RSBY on social inequalities in the use of recommended sexual, reproductive, and maternal health services, maternal health, and neonatal health. The findings from this study will help to inform interventions for reducing overall levels and inequalities in maternal and neonatal mortality. More generally, these results will have the potential to influence the design of universal health coverage systems through a better understanding of how to improve equitable access to quality health services and reduce social inequalities in maternal and newborn health."
Assessing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and financial support programs on social inequalities in mental health in Canada,"['Nandi, Arijit', 'Harper, Samuel', 'Yang, Seungmi']","['Gariépy, Geneviève', 'Kennell, Sarah', 'Arneja, Jasleen']","['Addiction', 'Covid-19', 'Disparties', 'Impact Evaluation', 'Mental Disorders', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Illness', 'Social Inequality', 'Social Policy', 'Substance Use']",104600.0,460308,"There is growing evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures applied to curb its spread, and its coincident economic shock, have had a profound negative impact on population mental health, including sharp increases in anxiety, depression, and substance use. However, few studies have explored the effects of the pandemic among socially vulnerable groups who were disproportionately affected, and the effectiveness of policies implemented to address the economic consequences of the pandemic are unknown. 

We propose to examine the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and attendant policy responses on patterns of mental health and substance use in the Canadian population. This empirical study will use data from a pan-Canadian cohort of adults surveyed in any of the past six waves of the population-representative Canadian Community Health Survey Annual Component, 2015 to 2020. This cohort of roughly 306,000 will be linked to administrative data including mental health and substance use outcomes over the study period from 2015-2020, as well as receipt of COVID-19 financial benefits from tax files. 

Our specific aims are:

Aim 1. To measure the population-level impact of the pandemic nationally, within provinces/territories, and across social groups, as well as whether these effects varied depending on local response measures implemented.

Aim 2. To measure the impact of financial support programs, including the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) program, on mental health and substance use.

Aim 3. To evaluate how financial support programs affected social inequalities in mental health and substance use.

By capitalizing on rich survey and administrative data, this project will provide a comprehensive pan-Canadian investigation into the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and interventions implemented, which is critical to enhance preparedness for future health emergencies."

Accordingly, a growing body of empirical evidence, including the results of quasi-experimental evaluation studies, is emerging on the impacts of these policy interventions on the use of cannabis and other substances, including alcohol and tobacco. However, this evidence has not been systematically reviewed. In this study, we propose a systematic review of studies using quasi-experimental designs to examine the impact of cannabis decriminalization and legalization on cannabis and other substance use. We will search the Embase, Medline, and PsycINFO databases via Ovid, as well as the Web of Science Core Collection and Criminal Justice Database (ProQuest) from date of inception to present. Grey literature sources will include conference abstracts and pre-print repositories. Eligible studies will be: 1) conducted in any population; 2) examine the impact of group-level cannabis decriminalization or legalization (medical or recreational) or a cannabis policy feature (e.g., retail sales) on cannabis or other substance use; and 3) apply a quasi-experimental evaluation design. Extracted data will be synthesized qualitatively using a descriptive analytic approach and quantitatively via meta-analysis. In addition to assessing the impacts of cannabis decriminalization and legalization on cannabis and other substance use, we will use a meta-regression framework to investigate heterogeneity in policy impacts related to differences in policy type (cannabis decriminalization, medical cannabis legalization, or recreational cannabis legalization), policy features (e.g., commercial sales), or study population. By bringing together an intersectoral team of investigators and knowledge users, this systematic review will address an important knowledge gap and help to inform evidence-based public health policymaking."

However, once it began to spread to many countries resulting in an ongoing outbreak, it became an international public health emergency. The ongoing outbreak has had a particular impact on the gay, bisexual, and men who have sex with men (gbMSM) community. Although the COVID-19 pandemic taught the world that understanding infectious disease transmission is important, it is equally crucial to analyze the influence of human behaviour in disease dynamics. Reducing the spread of mpox requires understanding how people will respond to information about the disease and how behavioural changes elicited by this response can affect public health strategies. Moreover, the disproportionate impact of mpox in the gbMSM community implies that additional behavioural concerns need to be addressed. In particular, stigmatizing attitudes result in increased hesitancy to access public health assistance by gbMSM individuals while also influencing public opinion of mpox. This project develops an epidemiological model of mpox that includes changes in behaviour. This modelling is driven by data from scientific literature and near real-time behavioural information from social media on prevailing attitudes towards mpox and members of the gbMSM community. The project will create a community advisory board that includes experts and members of the gbMSM community in order to develop culturally sensitive and adequate strategies and ensure timely knowledge translation of our results to a broad audience."
Motivation for emigration as a predictor for depressive symptomatology and general mental health in East Asian immigrants,"['Na, Sumin']",['N/A'],"['Depression', 'Minority Mental Health', 'Motivation', 'Predictors']",17500.0,200593,"Past research has shown that immigrants from East Asia may be at higher risk for depression than their Caucasian counterparts (Kuo, 1984). Motivation for emigration has been included in many models of migration as a critical determinant of acculturation and adaptation process (Berry, 1997). Literature suggests that preservation motivation (emigrating for physical, social and psychological security) reported poorer well-being and mental health than those higher in self-development motivation (personal growth as a reason for emigration) (Tartakovsky & Schwartz, 2001). Because there has been no research to date to identify the relationship between migration motivation and depression, the aim of this study is to identify the relationship between motivation for emigration to depression and general mental health in East Asian immigrants. By gaining further knowledge regarding possible determinants of depression in East Asian immigrants, further research can be conducted regarding prevention and intervention programs and culturally sensitive psychotherapies."

Our community-based, Indigenous-led research team proposes the upscaling, delivery, and evaluation of the ""Virtual Resilience & Wellness Journey Program Pathway"" at the Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC)'s Resiliency Lodge, an Elder-led program that provides distinctions-based, land-based, culturally-safe, trauma-informed support online for Indigenous women, two-spirit, and gender-diverse people healing from trauma and violence. We propose the use of participatory action methodologies with Elders, Grandmothers, Knowledge Holders, Resiliency Lodge staff, and other Indigenous-led virtual support programs in Canada to address the research questions: What are the impacts of COVID-19 on the development and delivery of Elder-led support services? 
How are these Elder-led support services adapting to the impacts of COVID-19? How can we engage Elders and other Knowledge keepers in the development of culturally and contextually relevant evaluation framework to evaluate best practices for virtual Indigenous-led support? Our research approach ensures research findings address critical gaps in knowledge of culturally safe COVID-19 prevention, preparedness, response and recovery strategies, accelerates community-led knowledge, and strengthens Elder-led program infrastructure for communities on the frontlines of culturally safe violence prevention and intervention."

Plusieurs études ont démontré qu'avoir une vie sociale active est un facteur déterminant pour le maintien de la santé et de la qualité dans cette population. De plus, si l'on considère que la majorité des populations occidentales habitent en zone urbaine, le modèle urbanistique des villes est potentiellement un levier d'intervention pour favoriser la vie sociale chez les ainés.

À partir de cette étude, notre objectif est d'explorer comment s'articule la vie sociale d'une population d'ainée dans l'environnement urbain. Pour ce faire, les participants de cette étude seront munis d'un capteur GPS qui collectera des données continues sur leurs déplacements pendant une période de sept jours. Ces données de mobilités seront ensuite intégrées à un système d'information géographique permettant de décrire l'environnement urbain.  Finalement, ces mesures spatiales seront ensuite combinées avec des questionnaires sociologiques dans le but d'obtenir une représentation détaillée de leurs interactions sociales et les localiser dans l'environnement urbain. 

Cette étude permettra de mieux comprendre (1) la dynamique des interactions sociales en milieu urbain, (2) quelles caractéristiques de la ville influencent la vie sociale chez les ainés et (3) comment cette implication sociale favorise la santé et le bien-être dans ces populations.

Les résultats attendus nous informeront sur les formes urbaines qui contribuent au bien-être des ainés par l'intermédiaire de la vie sociale. Cette perspective de connaissance est donc très importante, car elle permet de soutenir et d'orienter des politiques d'aménagement du territoire plus adéquat."

One way to increase the number of available organs is by maximizing the use of all available deceased donor kidneys. My research addresses the need to dramatically increase the rate of deceased kidney donation preventing deaths on the transplant waiting list. First, I will determine reasons organs are being discarded; organs are discarded for a variety of reasons including: demographics, clinical history and laboratory values. This aim will help form the basis for the development of evidence-based guidelines around the optimal use of deceased donor kidneys for transplantation and identify areas for targeted interventions to reduce organ discard . Second, I will determine if we can safely donate kidneys from deceased persons where the organ was traditionally considered suboptimal (referred to as expanded criteria deceased organ donors). I will use administrative databases to study deceased organ kidneys in Ontario.  The ultimate goal of this research is to increase the use of deceased organ kidneys, thereby decreasing the number of individuals on the kidney transplant waitlist."

These responses include primary prevention targeting behaviors associated with increased fatalities in the general population (e.g., impaired driving) and secondary prevention, aimed at subgroups most at-risk, including children (e.g., child restraint legislation [CRL]). While several low- and middle-income countries have introduced CRL into their policy framework, there are important differences among regulations in the world, ranging from no restraint to restraints up to 12 years old with different weight and height requirements.

The COVID-19 pandemic and global uprisings for racial justice have raised awareness of the lack of concerted policy action to address anti-Black racism and health inequities experienced by Black communities. This has been accompanied by debates on the collection and use of data on health and social outcomes by racial identity (race-based data). These debates offer contesting views on the value of race-based data, what the presence or absence of this data does, and the role data may play in policy making. Calls for race-based data generally reflect ideas of evidence-informed policy making which suggests that evidence of problems and solutions are needed to drive policy decisions. However, current evidence on health inequities has not led to significant policy action with policy action usually observed where there is a strong relationship between knowledge, policy communications and Black community advocacy. As a result, past research has called for a greater focus on the role of power, politics and ideology in policymaking. Using critical race theory, I will research the relationships between evidence on racial health inequalities and policymaking in public health in this changing policy context. I will interview policy makers, researchers and Black health organizations and social movements, and analyse policy documents to examine how race, anti-Black racism and racial health inequities are constructed in public health policymaking in Canada. In doing so, I will explore how the proofs of racial inequities (race-based data) that evidence-informed policy making demands may be tool to hide the lack of policy action to eliminate racial health inequities created by anti-Black racism. My research will provide insight on how to influence policy change to reduce and eliminate the profound racial inequities that exist in social life with direct and fatal impacts on health."

PrEP is a highly effective HIV-risk reduction strategy and a critical part of a comprehensive approach to HIV prevention. However, data shows that the use of PrEP among PrEP-eligible ACB people in Ontario is very low. 

The overall goal of this research program is to identify and address (reduce) the barriers to uptake and use of PrEP, increase the proportion of eligible ACB people starting and retained on PrEP, reduce the incidence of new HIV infections, and ultimately slow the trajectory of HIV infection in ACB communities in Ontario and in Canada.   

In collaboration with two Black serving community organizations and other community service providers, this work will include two main phases, the first is the use of focus groups and semi-structured interviews with PrEP-eligible Blacks to identify the specific structural barriers affecting uptake and use of PrEP. We will then use these findings in the 2nd phase to adapt and scale an HIV PrEP implementation strategy - Client-Centered Care Coordination (C4) in a community health center and an AIDS Service Organization to significantly improve the uptake and use of PrEP among PrEP-eligible people from ACB communities.

Lessons learned from this project will enable us to scale up this intervention in other ACB communities in Canada to reach zero new HIV infections."
Influence of socioecological factors on the pace of reproductive aging and the risk of cardiometabolic diseases in peri- and post-menopause - A reproductive life course study,"['Nepomnaschy, Pablo A', 'Jones, Meaghan J']","['Berry, Nicole S', 'Conklin, Annalijn', 'Pyle, Glen W']","['Aging-Related Health Outcomes', 'Biological Aging', 'Cardiometabolic Disorders', 'Machine Learning', 'Menopause', 'Mixed Models', 'Perimenopause', 'Reproductive Aging', 'Stress Axis - Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis', ""Women'S Reproductive Health""]",906526.0,502454,"Menopause, defined as the cessation of menstrual periods lasting at least a year, is accompanied by changes in women's metabolism, hormonal profiles, and body composition. These changes are associated with increased risks for later-in-life cardiometabolic diseases (CMD) such as diabetes, obesity, high blood pressure, stroke and heart attacks.

Life expectancy is increasing, and by 2030 there will be an estimated 1.2 billion post-menopausal women worldwide. As women live longer post-menopause, they face higher risks of CMD-related illnesses. Preventative strategies are, thus, essential, particularly for women with limited access to effective diagnoses and treatments.

Emerging evidence suggests that menopause-related health risks may be linked to the pace of biological aging including pace of the menopausal transition and age at menopause. Yet our understanding of the factors that influence the speed of this process is still limited. To fill this gap, we build upon our Society, Environment and Reproduction (SER) Study, one of the longest-running studies on women's reproductive health. SER includes the repeated collection of interviews, biological and physical measurements, and medical records from 110 Mayan women from Guatemala since 2000, when they were 18-45 years old, through 2026, when they will be 44-71. Our goal is to investigate the social and environmental factors that influence the timing of menopause and their impact on later-in-life CMDs, focusing on insulin resistance and diabetes, primary concerns for SER women. We will explore whether the biological stress caused by nutritional, social and immune challenges across women's adult lives influence the pace of menopausal transition and cardiometabolic health post-menopause. This knowledge will inform the development of public health guidelines and health promotion programs that target specific challenges and support women at critical times to promote healthy aging for women, both locally and globally."
Building resilience among young adults with serious mental illness: The role of physical activity and self-compassion as intervention targets,"['Nesbitt, Amy']",['N/A'],"['Behavioural Intervention', 'Mental Illness', 'Narrative Inquiry', 'Person-Centred Research', 'Physical Activity', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quantitative Methods', 'Resilience', 'Self-Compassion', 'Stigma']",105000.0,458321,"Young adults (16-29 years old) are the highest risk age group for the onset of serious mental illness. This is concerning as the experience of mental illness can negatively impact young adults' functioning in meaningful activities and life roles, such as their academics, work and relationships. Additionally, young adults diagnosed with mental illness are vulnerable to feelings of shame and self-stigma, which can further threaten their daily functioning and mental health recovery. Physical activity and self-compassion may be important strategies for combating these emotional risk factors and promoting young adults' resiliency. As such, the proposed research aims to explore how stigma, shame, physical activity and self-compassion influence the functioning and recovery of young adults living with serious mental illness. Study 1 will explore how the experience of mental illness impacts young adults' functioning and their ability to engage in meaningful activities. Study 2 will examine whether physical activity and self-compassion protect young adults against the negative effects of shame and self-stigma, and promote better functioning and mental health. Study 3 will test whether a physical activity and compassion-based intervention is beneficial for young adults' functional and mental health recovery. Taken together, this research may highlight important targets for interventions that aim to improve young adults' mental health recovery by building their resilience and supporting their participation in the activities that bring meaning and purpose to their life. This information can be used to inform future research and practice in adolescent and young adult mental health services."
"The growing crisis of overly big babies:  Comparing prevalence, outcomes and risk factors in midwifery v physician care","['Nethery, Elizabeth M']",['N/A'],"['Health Services', 'Large For Gestational Age', 'Macrosomia', 'Model Of Care', 'Neonatal Outcomes', 'Normal Birth', 'Population Health', 'Pregnancy And Birth']",150000.0,376218,"A bigger than average baby (called macrosomia) is generally accepted as an adverse outcome in maternity care. About 10% of all babies in Canada are macrosomic. This is a significant public health concern as macrosomia has been linked to higher rates of cesarean or forceps delivery, severe birth trauma, excess bleeding, infant birth injury and infant death. Macrosomia is increasingly common worldwide, in part due to increases in obesity, excess weight gain and diabetes among childbearing women.  A surprising recent finding indicated that 18% of all midwife-involved births in Ontario were macrosomic babies. Midwifery is a rapidly growing profession in Canada and outcomes are understudied. Reasons for these elevated rates of macrosomia among midwifery clients is unknown. Further, the impact of macrosomia on severe health outcomes is also unknown and it may differ for midwifery vs physician care. This study proposes to address this serious research gap by examining two cohorts of births in BC and WA state who were attended by midwives and physicians. The study findings will clarify the extent of macrosomia and associated severe outcomes among midwife v. physician births.  Further, this will identify individual factors, aspects of prenatal or labor (adherence to specific obstetric guidelines from the Society of Gynecologists of Canada), or differences in training of midwives or gestational diabetes screening methods which could reduce severe morbidities among bigger babies and their mothers. Study findings can be used to propose evidence-based interventions, updated guidelines or policies to improve health for larger babies and reduce adverse outcomes such as cesarean delivery, birth trauma, or newborn birth injury."
Health Impact of Unexpected School Closure,"['Nettel-Aguirre, Alberto']","['Hawe, Penelope(Penny)', 'Lupien, Sonia J', 'McCormack, Gavin R']","['Educational Engagement', 'Health Behaviours', 'School Closure', 'Social Capital', 'Social Networks', 'Stress']",,204711,"In June 2010 Eugene Coste Elementary School in Calgary will close. Children are having to deal with the prospect of starting up in a new schools, either closer or further away from their current homes, either with or without their classmates.  Some children (mistakenly) think the closing is due to some fault of their own.  By coincidence, in 2009 and early 2010, we undertook a baseline health and social well being assessment survey among Grades 4-6 students as the first step towards a two year whole school mental health resilience building intervention with the school. That project has now been abandoned. But this unexpected event represents a UNIQUE NATURAL EXPERIMENT OPPORTUNITY instead. We seek new funds to follow the children to their destination schools (of which there are just two likely main ones) and determine, by serial measurements over 20 months, the impact on their well being and learning outcomes. Each measurement in the new school will involve that whole school (and not just the migrating students).

The reason why there might be an impact on health and well being is because a strong personal sense of connection to school is the largest single predictor of subsequent child and adolescent health risk behaviours. So dislocation might be detrimental. There seems to be no other site in the world where, by coincidence, baseline assessment on health and health behaviours, social networks and a biological measure of stress (salivary cortisol) were completed with a school prior to an unexpected policy decision of school closure. The two destination schools differ in size and ethnic makeup from the original school, offering unprecedented opportunity to look at how children adjust to different contexts.

The policies that drive school closure decisions might be made differently if comprehensive data on student impact were made available."

Children have to deal with the prospect of starting up in a new school, closer or further away from home and away from whatever comfort zone they had established at their former school. Because school connection is a predictor of child well being (in particular, substance use and school dropout), this is an important public health problem.

By coincidence, in 2009 and early 2010, we undertook three baseline surveys among Grades 4-6 students, as the first step towards what we thought was going to be a two year whole school health promotion project with that school. That project was abandoned. Our facilitator instead acted as our eyes and ears in the school on how change was being experienced. New funding is now sought for a new idea, which is to investigate the impact of this unexpected event on the students in their destination school over time. 

We will follow the children to their destination school and determine, by repeated measurements (3 before the event and 6 after), the impact on their stress (cortisol), social networks, mental and physical health and health behaviours.  We will also interview parents and gauge their reflections on the transition process.

School closures are not uncommon.

Research 101: Empowering community members in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside to develop local guidelines for ethical research with people who use drugs,"['Neufeld, Scott D']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2500.0,400574,"The Downtown Eastside (DTES) of Vancouver is one of the poorest neighborhoods in Canada and has been the site of several public health crises, including multiple epidemics of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s (primarily affecting Men Who Have Sex With Men) and 1990s (primarily affecting injection drug users) as well as the more recent opioid overdose crisis. This background of intersecting social and health issues has made the DTES one of the most heavily-researched communities in the world. Too often, however, this research has benefitted researchers disproportionately, and left community members feeling exploited, misrepresented, and exhausted. Mistrust of researchers and their projects may reduce the willingness of community organizations and individuals to work with researchers, either as participants or community-based collaborators, ultimately decreasing the potential reach and robustness of community-based health research. 

Our project utilized a partnership between academic researchers and community members to begin to address the longstanding mismatch between university ethics boards and community concerns with research. Together, we developed ""Research 101"", a series of workshops that brought together approximately 13 representatives from peer-based, research-involved organizations in the DTES to discuss the pitfalls and potential of research in their neighborhood and to express community expectations for more ethical and respectful research. This led to the development of a co-authored ""Manifesto for ethical research in the Downtown Eastside"" that serves as a resource to empower community organizations to develop more equitable partnerships with researchers and instruct researchers in community expectations for better research relationships, ultimately leading to better partnerships and better research. Local guidelines for ethical research could be elicited from community members in other heavily-researched communities using a similar approach to ours."
Loneliness and social engagement among older adults: Examining the importance for health and for the development of age-friendly communities.,"['Newall, Nancy E']",['N/A'],"['Age-Friendly Communities', 'Health Care Service Utilization', 'Healthy Aging', 'Loneliness', 'Social Engagement']",90000.0,194104,"A lot of research suggests that our social relationships are important to our health. In fact, in one provocative study, the authors concluded that being lonely or dissatisfied with relationships is as strong a risk factor to our health as smoking (House et al., 1988). The present study is about further examining this connection between our social relationships and health. This project is also about exploring ways that communities can help older adults be socially engaged. The first research question is: given evidence that loneliness and lack of social participation is detrimental to health, does this also translate into greater health service use? This question is important, especially given the associated costs of health care, and will be addressed by examining information gathered from older adults and health care records. Results of this study may have important implications for health care professionals providing rehabilitation services and programming for older adults. 

One way to address the social participation and loneliness of older adults is to create supportive, inclusive, or age-friendly environments. Therefore, the second research question is: what are communities in Manitoba doing to address the social engagement of their older community members? This question follows from a study conducted as part of the larger Manitoba Age-Friendly Communities Initiative which asked municipality representatives about the age-friendliness of their community (e.g., housing, social programs). A good proportion answered that they have programs for socially isolated adults and the present study will gather additional information on how these programs function. This information could be used to help other communities address the social engagement of older adults, make communities more age-friendly, and, ultimately, improve the health and well-being of older adults in our community."

The workshop will enable open discussion around contentious research regarding BPA and risk assessment science more broadly, and associated implications and politics around risk management strategies and outcomes. Using BPA as an example, the intent is to critically review and translate existing knowledge and policy around CoCs, and collaboratively identify knowledge gaps and a future research agenda, using BPA as a catalytic case study. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the environmental issues around BPA and CoCs, including how BPA and CoC policy affects population groups and/or areas of industry from an environmental perspective. This will be accomplished by building transdisciplinary linkages between debates and expertise within the physical, social and policy sciences, in addition to those involved in the application of findings (i.e., industry). The workshop will bring together the research and perspectives of a range of BPA / CoC knowledge producers and users (academics, policy, and industry), thereby enabling greater opportunity for meaningful translation, exchange and informing one another's research, policy and practice agendas. Students will also be invited to participate in the workshop as observers. Together, the outcome products will increase knowledge and awareness of environmental issues related to BPA and CoCs from an interdisciplinary perspective, and will increase the application of research knowledge in decision-making and best practices (i.e., policy/management) in government, industry, and society."

It is important that the connections between cultural continuity, food security, and community health are understood first.  This allows us to understand how climate change is affecting these connections. 
This research uses a community based research approach meaning that the research objectives and specific methods are created together with the community.  This research was developed with community members through a community discussion process.  Its specific objective comes from the community's concerns about how climate and other changes are affecting the health and migratory patterns of the animals they rely on. The overall objectives of this research are first to give voice to the concerns of Chesterfield Inlet community members.  Secondly, to help them in arguing for change that will benefit people as well as the animals they care so deeply about.
The data collection is done through focus groups at a community level and interviews with individuals.   Using these two methods means that I will hear both general and specific views. Community members are also part of the data analysis to make sure the results are complete and true to what they shared.
Initial results show that climate change has caused the sea ice to freeze up later and break up earlier.  Also, having mines nearby has altered the migratory patterns of caribou and seals in particular, which are important to the local diet.  
Understanding these connections and the impact of changes in the local context allow future adaptation policies to be evidence informed.

Of these, 1.25 million are young caregivers (those under 25) who care for a sibling(s), parent(s), or grandparent(s) while juggling school and sometimes paid work. Most Canadians are unaware of the responsibilities and challenges faced by these 'invisible' caregivers and they are a severely understudied group in Canada. As a result of COVID, young caregivers and their families may experience a greater impact from experiences such as, but not limited to, unemployment (due to financial strain from caregiving), delayed access to services for their loved ones, and fears of infecting a loved one who is in a high risk category for infection from COVID. This project expands on an ongoing study in Ontario to address knowledge gaps from community service providers in 3 other provinces: Alberta, British Columbia, and Nova Scotia. The study objectives are: 1) to identify the impact of restrictions on young caregivers and their families; 2) how they navigated and responded to these changes/impacts; 3) identify the key factors at the micro-, meso-, and macro- levels that influenced the impact of and how they navigated COVID; 4) explore gender differences in caregiving experience, challenges, and expectations in young caregivers, their parents, and those whom they care for; 5) compare and contrast the experiences of participants living in rural versus urban communities across Canada; 6) to determine the most appropriate and acceptable strategies to support caregiving families and their children; and 7) create and grow a national network throughout this project to allow existing and new network members to use the knowledge created during this study to support their clients and eventually leverage collective action to influence broader change throughout Canada during recovery from COVID and beyond."

However, regionally representative and culturally safe guidelines for research and evaluation involving Indigenous peoples do not exist.  

Our project aims to address this gap through meaningful engagement with First Nations, Métis and Inuit communities in the Fraser Salish region to develop Indigenous health research and evaluation protocols (a form of guidelines). This project builds on previous work with Indigenous researchers, community health representatives and community members to embed Fraser Salish values, worldviews, and teachings in the protocols. We propose to take a distinctions-based approach and facilitate Sharing Circles for First Nations. Métis and Inuit community members to inform the development of the Fraser Salish protocols and a complimentary online training module, as well as knowledge sharing and implementation strategies. Our methods of engagement are rooted in Indigenous methodology that uphold ceremony, and will ensure that traditional healing and wellbeing practices are reflected in the protocols. 

This project will result in community-led resources that support cultural safety and humility in health research and evaluation in the Fraser Salish region. We anticipate that outcomes of the engagement and knowledge sharing activities will include strengthened relationships with First Nations, Métis and Inuit communities and organizations, generating collaborative, reciprocal partnerships for future health research and evaluation initiatives."

Exciting recent research has demonstrated that use of antiretroviral medications--either in topical gels or oral tablets--can reduce the risk of HIV infection during unprotected sex. These results provide renewed impetus for the development of topical rectal microbicides. Topical rectal microbicides are products designed to be applied to the rectal mucosa to prevent or significantly reduce the chances of contracting HIV. Globally, men who have sex with men (MSM) are 20 times more likely to be living with HIV than the general population. Thailand, in particular, is at the forefront of a burgeoning and largely unchecked epidemic among MSM in Asia. Nevertheless, the promise of microbicides may be limited by a lack of social research and much needed evidence to bridge the widespread science-to-practice gap that exists for many medical technologies. In order to be effective in the real world beyond medical studies, any new prevention product must be acceptable and accessible to end-users. The proposed study is the first of its kind in Asia and the developing world; we use cutting-edge, integrated qualitative and quantitative approaches to provide evidence that supports the transfer of scientific advances in medical research studies into everyday practice and policy in a key global setting. The study engages local communities in the research process, with results designed to guide healthcare providers, public health officials, policymakers, advocacy organizations and communities. As HIV ultimately knows no borders, with costs to Canada in the millions annually to pay for expensive HIV treatments for Canadians and aid to developing countries, investment in social research on new prevention technologies is an ethical and cost effective response to reverse the most deadly epidemic of our time."

India has the second highest number of PLHIV in the world; HIV disproportionately affects men who have sex with men (MSM), their male and female partners, and children. With initial HIV vaccine trials planned among MSM in India, we and our community-based collaborators believe it is vital to empower MSM communities to make informed choices and advocate for their needs and rights in HIV vaccine trials. A contentious history of biomedical research, and differences in power and culture between trial sponsors and local communities, presents challenges to meaningful involvement of MSM in HIV research. 

This 3-year study is guided by critical ethnography both to describe what currently exists and to advocate for and empower MSM. Sites: Chennai and Mumbai. Phase 1 (qualitative): 6 focus groups with MSM (n=48), in-depth interviews with community advocates/service providers (n=12) to explore HIV vaccine/clinical trial knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and ""local vaccination cultures."" Phase 2 (quantitative): theory-informed survey, supported by Phase 1, among 600 MSM to assess willingness to participate (WTP) in HIV vaccine trials and determinants of WTP.

Microbicides are among the most promising products under development. A microbicide to reduce HIV transmission during vaginal or anal intercourse could take many forms, including a gel, cream or douche. In particular, a rectal microbicide would be an important addition to HIV prevention methods for men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women, who are at disproportionately high risk for HIV globally. A growing epidemic among MSM in Asia has been largely neglected; in Thailand, MSM are 20-30 times more likely to contract HIV than the general population.

In Bangkok, MSM have 100 times higher rates of HIV than the general population, with YMSM (16-21 years-old) at even higher risk than older MSM-among the highest rates of new HIV infections in the world. Despite this, YMSM and YTGW are largely excluded from existing Thai HIV outreach efforts: these primarily target older MSM and TGW at gay bars and clubs, with a minimum age of entry of 20-years-old. Additionally, many YMSM and YTGW do not publicly identify as gay or TGW, and do not feel comfortable using HIV services delivered by gay or TGW community-based organizations (CBOs). This convergence of high HIV risk, lack of access to HIV prevention programs, and lack of evidence to support interventions tailored for these populations, is a public health emergency. The goal of this innovative project is to culturally adapt and evaluate an evidence-based HIV prevention program with YMSM and YTGW in Thailand. We will work with YMSM, YTGW, a Community Advisory Committee, local CBOs and service providers to build on a peer outreach model with demonstrated effectiveness in reducing HIV risk among YMSM in North America, by culturally adapting (such as matching slightly older with younger YMSM and YTGW, more appropriate in Thai culture than same-age peers) and testing the model in Thailand. In addition to evaluating program outcomes, we will use participatory methods, training YMSM and YTGW in digital storytelling to represent their experiences, and share findings with other YMSM, YTGW, CBOs, policymakers and the public in Thailand and internationally. Results from this culturally adapted HIV prevention program will advance health knowledge and health outcomes for sexual minority youth, and support a replicable model for use with other youth in the Global South who are highly impacted by HIV."

Systemic discrimination, economic and health inequities, and past unethical medical research heighten distrust of vaccines and health authorities, posing barriers to COVID-19 vaccination. ""Vaccine hesitancy"" (VH)-delays in acceptance or refusal of vaccination, even when vaccines are available-is often attributed to anti-vaxxers and 'deficits' in scientific literacy among 'lay people'. However, WHO and leading research emphasize the need to examine multilevel drivers of VH among specific populations and locations-structural factors (e.g. sociocultural, historical, health system, economic); social and community influences (e.g. community norms about vaccination, COVID-19 stigma)-and for specific vaccines, such as COVID-19. VOICES, an ethnoracially-, gender-, and sexually-diverse multidisciplinary team, will apply a Public Understanding of Science framework and mixed methods-an online survey with discrete choice analysis, follow-up community focus groups, and participatory video to: 1) Explore local understandings of COVID-19 and VH among racialized sexual and gender minority communities in the Greater Toronto & Hamilton Area; 2) Examine multilevel structural and social factors associated with VH; and 3) Engage with community partners in knowledge mobilization to reduce COVID-19 VH and promote informed decision-making.

"Do Naps in Young Children Affect Night-Time Sleep Outcomes? If so, When? An Application of Multilevel Modelling","['Newton, Adam T']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],500.0,412257,"Naps among preschool and early-school-age children decline with age. The association between naps and night-time sleep is largely unknown. Others report longer naps predict shorter night-time sleep duration, but the relation between naps and other sleep outcomes are unclear. Further, others have not investigated day-to-day changes in the relation between naps and nigh-time sleep, nor interactions between other factors (i.e., child age and sex, other sleep problems and behavioral problems, and parent emotional problems), naps, and night-time sleep. We predict: (1) longer nap times and naps taken later in the day predict worse night-time sleep; and (2) this relation is stronger among (a) school-age children (vs. preschoolers), (b) those with more sleep problems, (c) those with more behavioral problems, (d) and those with parents with greater emotional problems. Parents (N = 279) of 1-10-year-old children from Canada, the United States, and Australia completed questionnaires (child sleep and behavioral problems, parent emotional problems) and 1-week of sleep diaries on naps and night-time sleep. Night-to-night changes were accounted with a statistical approach. Naps varied: 41% did not nap, 9% napped only once, 19% napped frequently, and 31% napped daily. Children who napped only once slept less at night and took longer to fall asleep on napping (vs. non-napping) nights. Children who napped frequently also took longer to fall asleep on napping (vs. non-napping) nights. While accounting for night-to-night variations within children, longer naps, but not later naps, and more child sleep problems predicted shorter night-time sleep and a longer time to fall asleep. This effect was greater among school-aged children (vs. preschoolers) but was not different if children had more sleep or behavioral problems, or if parents had emotional problems. These findings suggest longer naps can impact night-time sleep, especially among older children and those who did not nap always."

Hence, by focusing on Covid-19, the goal of this project is to develop effective logistical strategies and solutions to tackle the social impacts caused by sudden, large-scale epidemic outbreak so as to enhance the resilience of cities, countries, and societies. It strives to achieve five key objectives: 1) to investigate how individuals and societies with difference characteristics (e.g., age, jobs) perceive and react to the social impacts of and logistical strategy in tackling Covid-19, 2) to identify attributes that can catalyze information sharing and coordination between cities and countries in epidemic logistical planning, 3) to identify ways that can facilitate the transfer of strategies and solutions to cities and countries under diversified geographical and cultural contexts, especially those with relatively weak health systems, 4) to investigate how governments plan and respond to the different logistical needs of society in the outburst of a sudden, large-scale epidemic at different stages; and 5) to develop strategies, solutions, and a supporting framework to governments and societies to mitigate the rapid spread of Covid-19 in terms of logistical service control, especially for vulnerable groups and areas. By improving the logistical response and planning, we strongly believe that this project will secure healthier and more secure societies in Canada, China, and around the world in the long term."

Les insecticides sont très souvent utilisés pour lutter contre l'anophèle femelle (vecteur du paludisme). Cependant, ces insecticides contiennent du dichlorodiphényltrichloroéthane (DDT), un composé chimique qui a montré son efficacité contre l'anophèle femelle. Plusieurs études épidémiologiques ont néanmoins suggéré que les sujets exposés au DDT ont plus de chance de présenter des anomalies congénitales et un développement anormal du cerveau. Un individu peut être exposé au DDT bien avant sa naissance, étant donné que le DDT traverse aisément le placenta. C'est pourquoi, il est très compliqué de mesurer l'exposition réelle d'un individu au DDT dans le temps (1), et de déterminer si l'exposition avant la naissance joue un rôle plus important sur le cerveau que celle après la naissance (2). Une étude épidémiologique classique tient habituellement compte des facteurs sociodémographiques, nutritionnels et socioéconomiques. Cependant, elle ne prend pas en considération plusieurs paramètres physiologiques (qui sont difficiles à mesurer lors des enquêtes de terrain). La modélisation pharmacocinétique a l'avantage de prendre en considération ces paramètres physiologiques. Nous voulons prendre avantage du fait qu'un modèle pharmacocinétique pour le DDT ait déjà été développé et validé par le Dr. Marc-André Verner.

Pre-conception paternal factors (factors present before sperm meets egg) may directly cause alterations in the molecular machinery regulating gene expression in sperm, particularly in genes related to both brain and endocrine function. During pregnancy and postpartum, perinatal paternal factors may further impact the child's brain and endocrine function through their indirect influence on perinatal maternal depression and anxiety. Research from our group and others indicates that both pre-conception and perinatal paternal risk factors may lead to permanent changes in brain and endocrine systems during fetal development, and that this effect may last until adrenarche (i.e. a peak in adrenal steroid hormone production around 6-8 years old that represents the 1st step in pubertal maturation). Endocrine disruption during development (e.g. premature adrenarche) significantly increases the risk of impulse control disorders such as attention-deficit hyperactivity (ADHD), conduct and oppositional disorders. This suggests that paternal effects on brain and endocrine function of the child can potentially have long-term behavioral impacts that may extend to middle childhood. Understanding the paternal contribution to the child's brain and endocrine development will help tailor preventative public health interventions to decrease exposure to modifiable paternal risk factors. Paternal lifestyle changes made even a few weeks before conception could make a critical difference down the line in vulnerable children. Hence, anticipated results from this project are likely to have a strong public health impact and can be used to counsel fathers about modifiable risk factors as early as the pre-conception period."
Effects of Canadian Smoking Policies on Children's Use of E-Cigarettes and Exposure to Second-Hand Smoke in Cars,"['Nguyen, Van Hai']","['Bornstein, Stephen E', 'Chan, Kevin J', 'Gamble, John-Michael']","['Public Health Policy', 'Quasi-Experimental', 'Second Hand Smoke (Shs) Exposure', 'Smoking', 'Survey Data']",49200.0,385820,"Rising e-cigarette use among children and their exposure to second-hand smoke in cars have become significant public health challenges. In this study, we will investigate the behavioral and health impacts of two Canadian health policies recently adopted to address these significant child health risks: 1) Provincial bans on smoking of combustible cigarettes and e-cigarettes inside private vehicles; 2) Provincial bans on the sale of e-cigarettes to children. These policies have attracted substantial attention and debate in Canada and other countries. Yet, there is still little evidence on their effects. This research will use state-of-the-art quasi-experimental methods with data from national surveys and administrative data to estimate the effects of the policies. 

The potential impacts of our proposed research on child health are broad and substantial. Given the high burdens of asthma and other respiratory diseases related to smoking and second-hand smoke exposure, even modest reductions in these outcomes could have substantial health benefits. Through establishing whether, and to what extent, these bans on smoking in cars and access to e-cigarettes to minors can improve health outcomes and generate economic benefits, our study will inform efforts to monitor, strengthen and fine-tune these current policies. As the federal government is considering a national e-cigarette policy (Bill S-5) that, among others, bans smoking in cars and sales of e-cigarettes to minors, evaluation of these provincial laws will also provide timely evidence to inform potential effectiveness of this federal legislation and guide its enforcement efforts."
Health Effects of Vaping among Youth: Evidence from Quasi-Experimental Analyses,"['Nguyen, Van Hai']","['Diamond, David S', 'Bornstein, Stephen E', 'Newhook, Leigh Anne', 'Wilson, Brenda J']","['E-Cigarette Use', 'Mental Health', 'Policy Evaluation', 'Quasi-Experimental', 'Vaping', 'Youth']",99500.0,424423,"As vaping rates increase rapidly, especially among youths, there is a growing concern about adverse health outcomes of vaping. Several studies found that that vaping is correlated with a number of adverse mental and respiratory health outcomes. However, these studies were unable to separate the effects of vaping from that of confounding factors such as individuals' risk preferences. The objective of this project is to provide new, rigorous evidence on health effects of vaping and a major policy designed to protect children from vaping, namely, the Minimum Legal Age (MLA) for vaping. 

We will employ state-of-the-art econometric techniques that leverage the staggered implementation dates of the MLA policy across Canadian provinces to identify the effects of vaping and the MLA policy on: (i)  youth mental health (anxiety, mood disorder, depression and life satisfaction); and (ii) youth respiratory outcomes (asthma and asthma attacks). Data for this study are from the nationally-representative Canadian Community Health Surveys (CCHS) 2015-2019. 

This research will provide timely and much-needed evidence to inform policymakers and the public on important effects of vaping and its regulations."
Participation in CIHR Starting Investigator Workshop,"['Nguyen, Van Hai']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,400216,"I am seeking funding to cover my trip to Ottawa to attend CIHR's Institute of Population & Public Health (IPPH) Starting Investigator Workshop. I am a new investigator in the School of Pharmacy, Memorial University of Newfoundland. As a health economist by training, I have a special interest in public health policy. My current research is evaluating several emerging public health policies targeting substance use in Canada including marijuana legalization, ban on menthol cigarettes and ban on sales of e-cigarettes to minors in Canada. 

This workshop will be valuable at this stage of my career in many ways. First, it is a unique opportunity for me to establish collaborative networks across Canada. In particular, networking with government officials and civil society leaders is particularly important for my policy research as I am keen for my research findings to be useful and have impacts on policy making.  Further, I will also benefit tremendously from interacting with researchers at the same early career stage to share and learn from each other effective ways to address our challenges.  Second, as a new investigator who is still relatively new to the Canadian health research funding arena, I am keen to learn more about peer review process and gain familiarity with CIHR and its funding mechanisms. This workshop will help me to improve my grant applications, both in terms of grant writing and long-term grant planning. It will also help me to excel in my role as a referee for CIHR grants. Third, through this workshop I will be able to develop effective strategies to build and manage a successful research team. This is important for me to jumpstart  the work I will be undertaking as part of my new Canada Research Chair award (the first one for Memorial University in Pharmacy) in terms of building research capacity in health economics in Newfoundland and training the next generation of health economists in this province. 

Thank you for considering my application."
Le développement des communautés et équité en santé: les perspectives en promotion de la santé,"['Niang, Marietou']",['N/A'],"['Développement Des Communautés', 'Empowerment', 'Promotion De La Santé', 'Santé Des Femmes Et Des Enfants']",1500.0,352424,"Depuis quelques années déjà l'équité en santé est devenue un des objectifs les plus importants pour les politiques et systèmes de santé à travers le monde. Dans cette présentation, nous essaierons d'abord de définir l'équité en santé dans une perspective des droits de la personne. Nous soulignerons particulièrement le fait que les actions visant l'équité ne doivent pas simplement se limiter à garantir l'accès aux services de santé, mais elles doivent agir sur l'ensemble des déterminants sociaux de la santé pour promouvoir le bien-être et la santé des populations. En regard de cela, pour agir contre les inégalités sociales de santé persistantes en Afrique, le développement des communautés semble être une approche essentielle en promotion de la santé. Pour cela, un repositionnement épistémologique, théorique  et méthodologique du développement des communautés dans le champ de la promotion de la santé est nécessaire. Sur cet ordre d'idées, le développement des communautés doit viser le changement social fondamental à travers le partenariat intersectoriel, la participation effective et l'empowerment des communautés.  Pour soutenir ces actions dans les communautés, les agents de santé communautaire peuvent être des partenaires essentiels à considérer par les systèmes de santé, les décideurs politiques et les organisations nationales et internationales.  En effet, au-delà de leur rôle de liaison entre les populations et le système de santé, les agents de santé communautaire en regard de leur compétence culturelle et de leur leadership peuvent promouvoir des actions globales qui visent l'autoresponsabilité et l'autodétermination des communautés. À travers ces réflexions, nous proposons l'exemple des Bajenu gox (des femmes leaders qui travaillent comme agents de santé communautaire au Sénégal) qui, dans une perspective de développement des communautés, peuvent permettre aux femmes de s'approprier de certains de leurs droits fondamentaux."

The impact of autism is substantial and the need for resources often occurs on a daily basis and across the lifespan, with implications for personal and transitional development, family life, school involvement, community engagement, access to funding, mental health service needs, and the use of diagnostic, developmental, rehabilitation and other health and community services. Adding to the complexity, symptoms and outcomes range widely, hence the mix of needed treatments and resources vary substantially. Furthermore, there is a current lack of certainty about best treatment for autism. No comprehensive systematic reviews have evaluated the impact of autism interventions on outcomes. Accordingly, there is ongoing uncertainty about the relative impacts of various autism treatments and services. To address this uncertainty with existing best evidence, this project will implement a synthesis review of the literature reporting interventional outcomes for adults (=/>18 years) with autism. The project specifically comprises: (i) a synthesis review of relevant intervention studies, (ii) development of an evidence-informed framework mapping case characteristics and needs with potential interventional approach, and (iii) a Delphi consultation to solidify knowledge advancement and application through the development of practice statements and policy recommendations."

Our multiple programs of research are intended to reduce the criminalization of mental illness; facilitate accessible, high quality mental health care; develop, implement and evaluate services that improve patient outcomes, and safeguard public safety. The primary goal of our work is to create and synthesize knowledge on mental health, risk, and recovery to advance clinical practice and support evidence-informed policies and programs for mentally ill and marginalized populations.OBJECTIVES.Over the next 7 years, we will address 4 thematic objectives in ongoing and new studies:1 -Population Profiles & Pathways:Examine the characteristics of marginalized populations and their pathways into the continuum of psychiatric services and/or the criminal justice system.2 -Risks, Strengths & Trajectories:Study the appropriateness of the match between client risk and strengths to treatments and interventions.3 -Clinical, Psychosocial Outcomes and Community Reintegration:Evaluate the clinical functioning (psychological, physical health), psychosocial well-being (social integration, housing) and recovery of clients longitudinally. Determine whether clients are successfully transitioning between settings, avoiding adverse outcomes and building capacity.4 -KT Strategies:Use evidence to improve accessibility and quality of services for populations with mental illness, substance abuse problems and associated behavioural challenges across agencies.Potential Impact.Severely addicted and mentally ill individuals transition between diverse social agencies and mental health services, often with little therapeutic benefit and at considerable cost to the individual and to society. Our research is intended to improvehealth service deliveryby providing clinicians with structured measures to ensure reliable and valid assessments, placements, and treatment; to ensure an appropriate match between client needs and service delivery; while reducing adverse outcomes and cost of care. The improvement of service delivery will improve patient’s health outcomes, increase quality of life and further diminish adverse outcomes.Expertise.My researchis informing care and management practices in civil, forensic, and criminal justice settings across Canada, and increasingly, worldwide. I have expertise in quantitative research methods (eg, randomized control trials, longitudinal studies) and qualitative approaches (eg, focus groups). In addition, I have long-term, stable and diverse provincial, national and international collaborations which include people with lived experience, lawyers, psychiatrists, psychologists, nurses, criminologists, and allied professionals.Mentorship.Undergraduate, graduate and postgraduate trainees from diverse fields, (as well as direct care providers completing continuing education), are active in every aspect of research and scholarship including study design, protocol development, data collection, analyses, and dissemination. I provide support in attending and presenting at local, national, and international conferences, access to multi-disciplinary collaborators who are clinicians, academics and decision-makers across BC and Canada as well as international leaders in our field.

"Examining the interplay between victimization, justice involvement and housing among homeless mentally ill men and women: A longitudinal study","['Nicholls, Tonia L']","['Crocker, Anne G', 'Hwang, Stephen W', 'Krausz, Reinhard M', 'Latimer, Eric A', 'Roy, Laurence', 'Somers, Julian']","['Criminal Justice', 'Criminalization', 'Forensic', 'Homelessness', 'Mental Illness', 'Psychiatry', 'Psychology', 'Public Health', 'Victimization']",774958.0,305073,"Approximately 30,000 Canadians are homeless every night in Canada, costing the economy ~$7 billion annually. It is also estimated that as many as 67% of homeless adults in Canada have a mental illness. Homeless mentally ill adults are more likely to come into contact with the criminal justice system than other citizens, although they may be more likely to be the victims of violent crime than to perpetrate violence. Further, although mentally ill citizens commit less severe offenses than non-mentally ill citizens, they use 87% more police resources. This has led to widespread concerns around safety, the lack of appropriate services for this marginalized population, and associated costs. Presently, the approach believed to be most appropriate to serving mentally ill homeless adults is Housing First, a low barrier, rapid approach to providing housing and services (e.g., sobriety is not a requirement). However, research regarding the costs and appropriateness of Housing First for reducing criminal justice contacts and increasing safety is virtually nonexistent. This study will examine the relationships between victimization, homelessness, and criminal justice contacts in a large sample (N=1452) of homeless adults with mental illness. In the At Home/Chez Soi project, our team recently completed the largest study of a Housing First intervention ever done. By integrating extensive administrative data with the wealth of self report data from At Home Chez Soi the proposed project will build on that study and will examine how housing and services may reduce instances of victimization and contact with the criminal justice system in general, and among specific groups (e.g., women; Aboriginals). We will also report on the costs associated with health and criminal justice contacts and the intervention. Our capacity to improve services to one of the most marginalized populations in Canada has enormous potential for reducing human and economic costs."

Gut instinct - are probiotics the miracle 'bug' that will treat what ails us?
We've all seen the advertisements claiming that a tasty yogurt teeming with probiotics is just the ticket for making us feel better, healthier and more energized. But what are probiotics and how do they really contribute to our health? Our panel will provide an overview of what probiotics are, how they have been proven to be effective in treating disease, what the future holds for probiotics and finally how individuals might take advantage of the therapeutic power of probiotics in their daily lives. 

It's a Small World After All - Global Child Health leads to a Better World
At SickKids our vision is Healthier Children. A Better World. Not only do our research activities benefit the health outcomes of children here in Toronto, but also around the world. Our Global Child Health program champions child-focused issues of global importance and works with program partners (including governments and UN agencies) to advocate for, and assist with, the transfer of knowledge leading to the implementation of interventions of proven value to children everywhere.

Patients with prostate and bladder pain often experience moderate to severe pain, but do not always have a good understanding of why the pain is occurring and how they can minimize their symptoms. The Prostatitis and Interstitial Cystitis Clinics at Kingston General Hospital are the only two clinics dedicated to the study and management of urologic pelvic pain conditions in Canada.  Many of the over 1,000 patients we follow locally have expressed a strong interest in learning more about their medical problem.  

Our Café Scientifique will provide the perfect opportunity to disseminate that information. Using the informal approach of the Cafe, men and women with pelvic pain will be able to discuss their medical condition and learn more about treatments in a comfortable and informative setting.  The Café will discuss the specific conditions of interstitial cystitis (painful bladder syndrome which occurs primarily in women) and prostatitis (chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men), explore the concept and basic science behind the condition and describe what clinicians and researchers are doing to improve treatment for patients.  At the end of the Café, we believe that patients and their significant others will have a good understanding of chronic pelvic pain and how to manage their symptoms.

The effect that this will have on how much marijuana Canadians use and how often they use it is not known. Information on the long-term impacts of marijuana on health and social issues is also lacking. We need data on individuals who buy and use marijuana so that we can develop programs and policies that will protect and support Canadians. 
Our study will look at how we can collect those data and link them to the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy's Data Repository, a large database of information from health, social services, and the justice system. The information from individuals would be linked across these sectors with privacy protections in place, so that their identities would never be known. This would allow us to study how marijuana use patterns are changing and what effect they have on Canadians' well-being.
We will look at two different ways to collect data that can be linked to the Repository. We will work with a digital media firm to design a system for collecting data every time a person buys marijuana. The system would collect some personal information from the customer (e.g., age, sex and postal code) and information about the amount and type of marijuana sold. Our second strategy is to collect this kind of information using surveys. This would give us detailed information about how much and what kind of marijuana people are using. Data from both of these sources would be linked to the Repository in such a way that the individual people cannot be identified.
The Manitoba Centre for Health Policy will partner with other researchers and policy makers from different levels of government to ensure the project's findings fill the gap in what we know about cannabis use in Canada. The team will use the findings to build a stable, cost-effective data collection system to study marijuana use patterns and the effect of marijuana use on health and social issues."

First Nations, Metis and Inuit (FN/M/I) Canadians are one example of these. These groups have high rates of chronic illnesses (like heart disease and lung disease) that put them at high risk for poor COVID-19 outcomes. Many FN/M/I people experience poverty and live in over-crowded houses, making it hard to keep physically distant from others. As well, health and social services in FN/M/I communities are often underfunded. This means they may not be able to respond quickly to a health crisis if one occurs.
To help prevent this type of crisis, this project will provide data on who is being tested for COVID-19, using the province of Manitoba as a sample for the rest of Canada. Testing is one of the first important steps to keeping the spread of the virus down. We will compare rates of testing among FN/M/I people in Manitoba (looking at First Nations, Metis and Inuit groups separately) to rates of testing in the rest of Manitoba. This information can then be used to direct and scale-up the public health response to COVID-19 where it is most needed.
Using administrative data on Manitobans' health from the Repository at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy (MCHP), we will look at where testing is occurring geographically, what the testing rates are and whether FN/M/I people are being tested at a different rate than other Manitobans, and how many tests are likely going to be needed to keep the spread of COVID-19 under control. We will also develop methods to automate these queries in the data, so we can monitor the trends in real time throughout the pandemic. The findings will be shared with FN/M/I health leadership and with the Manitoba Government's Department of Health. With access to the latest data, these decision makers can then respond quickly to issues that arise."

To support First Nations families in reclaiming their tradition of breastfeeding, we have brought together First Nations community members and scholars, experts on breastfeeding and quality improvement, researchers, and healthcare providers to find a solution to this important problem. Over the next five years, our team will work with First Nations communities and hospitals to develop and implement a quality improvement initiative that aims to make it easier for families who give birth in the hospital to breastfeed and to support breastfeeding in their community. Our team's goals are to: 1) build relationships with First Nations communities and hospitals; 2) host sharing circles for First Nations families to tell their breastfeeding stories and learn more about what made it easier for them to breastfeed in hospital and in their community; 3) use the stories we hear and the wisdom from First Nations communities to recommend how hospitals and communities can care for First Nations families so that it is easier for them to breastfeed; and 4) work with hospitals and communities to put in place practices that support First Nations families to breastfeed. At the end of our project, the care First Nations families receive when giving birth in a hospital and at home will be specially designed to support breastfeeding while centering First Nations knowledges, culture and values."

However, in the years leading up to the COVID-19 pandemic, childhood vaccination rates began to drop across much of Canada. During the pandemic, childhood rates declined even further in some areas, raising concern among public health workers. All of this took place against a backdrop of ongoing systemic anti-Indigenous racism against Red River Métis in the health system.
Manitoba Health responded to the low rates by launching a public health campaign promoting the importance of childhood vaccinations, particularly for those who had fallen behind on their scheduled vaccines. Preliminary data suggest the campaign worked for some but not all Manitoba children, but we don't know why or for whom it didn't have much effect. We also lack Nation-specific information on whether it boosted childhood vaccination among Métis families.

We will analyze health system data and hold focus groups with Manitoba families to better understand how the public health campaign influenced decision-making on childhood vaccination during and after the pandemic. The project will shed light on whether the campaign effort improved childhood vaccination among Métis families, who have been systemically impacted by anti-Indigenous racism in the health system.
Our findings will support the development of strategies aimed at keeping childhood vaccination rates high in Manitoba as well as Nation-specific strategies for Red River Métis citizens. There are broad applications across Canada, especially where Indigenous citizens face racism in the health system. Ultimately, this work will help mitigate the adverse effects of future public health emergencies on child health."

However, many women face challenges when trying to breastfeed. In 2019, the Breastfeeding Committee for Canada began a national project aimed at helping hospitals provide high quality care specifically supporting women/birthing parents to breastfeed. This care is known as the Baby-Friendly Initiative. The Breastfeeding Committee for Canada involved 25 hospitals from across Canada in their quality improvement project. They used a well-established model, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's Breakthrough Series Model, to assist hospitals in improving care practices. Hospital staff were offered one-on-one coaching, webinars, workshops, and tools for data collection to help track their progress towards implementing the ten steps of the Baby-Friendly Initiative. At the end of the project, four hospitals received the Baby-Friendly designation, signifying that they had successfully put in place policies and practices to support breastfeeding. Six more hospitals were working towards this designation and several others had begun implementing the Baby-Friendly steps. However, questions remain about how best to extend the Baby-Friendly Initiative to community health centres and public health units to reach more women/birthing parents and help extend the period of time that they are able to breastfeed. In this proposal, our team, which holds expertise in quality improvement methods, breastfeeding healthcare practices, and women's health, will address these questions to ensure that all people who want to breastfeed receive the support they need, with the ultimate aim of promoting better health and health equity for the Canadian population."

As a result, patients with this disease experience high levels of depression and suicide.
Several researchers working in different fields related to head and neck cancer joined forces in 2005 to investigate how these cancers develop. They combined their expertise to form an international research consortium and started the first of two important research projects: The Head and Neck Cancer Life course (HeNCe Life) study.
This study investigates the relationships between genetic, biological (e.g., viral infections), social, psychological and behavioural factors along people's lives and the occurrence of head and neck cancer. We interview people in Canada, Brazil and India who have head and neck cancer and people who do not have this disease to investigate several characteristics of different populations. Once this study was successfully started, we initiated another international project: the Multi-Center Oro-pharyngeal Atypical Lesions (MuCOSAL) study. This project investigates molecular, infectious, and lifestyle factors in Americans, Canadians and Brazilians who have pre-cancerous lesions in their mouths to identify which patients will develop cancer.
We propose to hold a meeting with all the experts involved in these two related projects, including researchers, doctors, nurses, research personnel and advanced students to discuss our first findings and plan for the future. The strong collaborations established over the years have already contributed to the development of research projects that will be highly beneficial to public health and we hope to achieve even more by continuing and strengthening our collaboration."

We want to determine which factors influence this disease other than the known behavioural risk factors (e.g., smoking and alcohol habits) and to understand how these and other risk factors like viral infections are linked and interact with the environments in which one grows, develops and lives.
The HeNCe Life study aims to investigate these factors in residents of Canada, Brazil, USA and India. This will allow us to compare people who have mouth and throat cancers to people who do not have this disease. We interview people using a technique which is specially designed to help them remember their past life events and ask them many questions about their living and working conditions and several behaviours. We also collect saliva samples to look for genetic abnormalities related to alcohol and tobacco habits and to test for viral infections. This unique study investigates several characteristics of different populations while taking into consideration their social and cultural diversity.
This study will contribute to explain how certain events may put people into life trajectories that are either conducive to good health or not. Also, we will help to clarify if there is a specific life period where certain conditions or events (infections, poor nutrition) have a bigger impact than other time periods. This will assist health care providers to set policies and intervention programs (e.g., vaccinations, screening tests) that are more effective for a particular stage of life, minimizing the occurrence of these cancers globally."
A machine learning algorithm to predict individual risk of head and neck cancers in clinical settings,"['Nicolau, Belinda F']","['Allison, Paul J', 'Coates, Mark J', 'Franco, Eduardo L', 'Macdonald, Mary E', 'Madathil, Sreenath A', 'Makhoul, Nicholas', 'Rousseau, Marie-Claude']","['Algorithms', 'Head And Neck Cancer', 'Machine Learning', 'Primary Prevention', 'Risk']",75000.0,377862,"Cancers of the mouth, throat and larynx, known as ""head and neck cancer"", are together the 9th most common type of cancer in the world. It deeply affects how people swallow, eat, drink, talk and look, and less than half of people diagnosed with it are still alive after 5 years.

For decades, researchers have looked into the factors that cause head and neck cancer. Dr. Nicolau's team has been conducting such studies for many years, including the largest study ever conducted on this subject in Canada. All this research shows that many factors contribute to the development of this devastating disease. Some of the most important factors are smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, and human papillomaviruses (HPV). These and other factors interact in complex ways to cause the disease. However, all this knowledge has not yet been presented in a way that is easy for doctors and dentists to use when they discuss head and neck cancer with their patients.

Dr. Nicolau's team is developing a new strategy to prevent head and neck cancer. The team will apply computer science techniques called ""machine learning"" to the detailed information from their studies and those of other researchers to predict a person's risk of being diagnosed with head and neck cancer. For example, the models developed by the team will be able to forecast if the person's risk will decrease with a change in habits. In a subsequent project, the team will integrate these predictions into a web application, which will be used in clinics to help tackle head and neck cancer.

Head and neck cancer is becoming a major public health issue in Canada and other countries, especially because there has been a dramatic increase in cancers related to HPV in recent years. We expect that this project will lead to a clinical tool used by doctors, dentists and other health professionals with their patients to help them avoid this deadly disease, decreasing the burden of head and neck cancer in Canada."
Effect of cumulative exposure to antiretroviral therapy on cancer risk in people living with HIV,"['Nicolau, Ioana']",['N/A'],"['Aids-Defining Cancers', 'Antiretroviral Treatment', 'Cancer', 'Epidemiology', 'Hiv', 'Immune Suppression', 'Infection-Related And Unrelated Cancers', 'Mediation Analysis']",105000.0,378351,"Background: Cancer has been a major feature of the HIV epidemic, with Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma being the first reported manifestation of AIDS-defining cancers. With the arrival of antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV has become a chronic disease and studies have shown an increase in non-AIDS defining cancers. Additionally, people living with HIV have a higher risk of developing cancer than the general population. There are 75,500 Canadians living with HIV, with the highest proportion in Ontario. In Canada, there is a lack of research assessing the cancer burden and the effect of ART on cancer risk in people living with HIV. Objectives: 1) Determine the incidence and prevalence of site-specific cancers in adults living with HIV in Ontario between 1995 to 2016; 2) Determine whether specific ART regimens show protective cancer effects; and 3) Quantify the extent to which cumulative exposure to ART lowers the risk of infection-related cancers via controlled viremia and improved immune function. Methods: Study objectives will be achieved using data from Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, Ontario Cancer Registry, Ontario HIV Treatment Network Cohort study, and Canadian HIV Observational Cohort Collaboration. We will calculate incidence rates of site-specific cancers after HIV diagnosis using count modelling techniques. Period prevalence before HIV diagnosis, at HIV diagnosis, and short-term and long-term ART exposure will be calculated. We will quantify relationships between ART use, cancer risk, immune suppression, viremia, demographic, socio-economic and behavioural factors using mediation analysis techniques. Significance: This study will bring forward the need for comprehensive HIV care and cancer control. By understanding the cancer burden and the additional hardships of this key population, medical practice and policies can be adapted to offer better long-term care, plan for resource allocation, and optimize treatment to improve health outcomes."

Genetics have been recognized as a risk factor for chronic diseases and since many genetic variants have been identified as important, genetic risk scores that combine all of the identified variants have been created. These genetic risk scores are able to predict those who are at higher risk of gaining weight, developing high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and type II diabetes, and suffering a heart attack or stroke. However, studies that have evaluated these genetic risk scores have been conducted among middle-aged adults. No study has evaluated these scores in elderly groups. In old age, other problems such as reductions in food intake become more prevalent and so it is important to evaluate how these genetic risk scores are related with health outcomes in adults aged 70 years and up. In addition, features of one's surrounding environment including social support and food retailers are known to influence nutrition and health among elderly individuals. Therefore, this investigation will evaluate how genetic and non-genetic factors relate to nutrition and health among the elderly. Data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) combined with McGill University's Digital Commercial Food Surveillance Lab will be used to examine these relationships. Results of this study will inform researchers, health practitioners and policy makers about the importance of genetics and non-genetic factors in the health of elderly individuals in Canada."

However, the process of aging is impacted by a multitude of diverse biological, social, and environmental factors. Our research team has successfully developed a program to study relationships and interactions between the multiscale dimensions of health and disease as they pertain to aging, including genetic and non-genetic factors. Our previous work has identified important relationships between psychological and social (psychosocial) factors with diet and health outcomes. An important observation was that the psychosocial factors were significantly related to the outcomes independently of genetic risk for disease. As a continuation of our work with CLSA data, we propose to extend our approaches to incorporate data from CLSA follow-up assessments, link national data on the local food environment, and consider cognitive variables to further our investigation of the interplay between genetics, social, and environmental factors in nutrition, aging, and health. Key areas of interest include: 1) evaluating relationships between social factors and health outcomes related to cognitive function and chronic disease, and 2) evaluating relationships between the local food environment and chronic disease risk. We will also explore how genetic risk of neurodegenerative and chronic diseases may be modified when non-genetic factors are considered (diet, social, and food environment factors)."

Yet, Indigenous communities often experience negative health impacts from these extractive projects. International research has shown that Indigenous communities living near resource extraction face higher rates of disease, including cancer, as well as cultural, spiritual, social, and economic effects from losing access to their ancestral territories. For example, environmental contamination from projects can destroy important hunting areas and sacred ceremonial places. 

To protect the health of their lands and people, Indigenous communities are asking for a role in the assessment, approval, and monitoring of extractive projects. But, to make informed decisions, Indigenous communities need to know the true costs and benefits of extractive industries for the health and wellbeing of their members. Costs and benefits are unique to each community's experience and should be based on their own values, knowledges, and priorities. This research partners with the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation, Fort Chipewyan Métis Nation, and Mikisew Cree First Nation in northern Alberta to document the costs and benefits of the Tar Sands development for community health and wellbeing. To do so, this research uses focus groups, a household survey, and local health expenditure data to bring together First Nations and Métis perspectives with health economics techniques. Ultimately, we aim to develop an Indigenous framework for evaluating the true economic impacts of extractive projects and to share this new approach with Indigenous communities more broadly."

Multimorbidity can negatively affect quality of life and life expectancy (how long a person is expected to live), while increasing healthcare use. In Canada 1 in 10 youth less than 15 years have a physical, sensory, or intellectual or developmental disability. This number is rising because youth with disabilities are living longer and doctors are better at identifying and diagnosing disability. Youth with disabilities are already at risk of developing one chronic condition, but little is known about if and how they develop multiple chronic conditions. The overall goal of this project is to find common chronic conditions, understand multimorbidity, and it's patterns among youth with disabilities using various statistical procedures. First, we will identify the most common chronic conditions among youth with disabilities, compared to youth without disabilities. Second, we will determine how multimorbidity develops among youth with disabilities and at what rate, compared to youth without disabilities. Third, in youth with 2 or more chronic condition we will determine groups of chronic conditions that bunch together in youth with disabilities compared to youth without disabilities using artificial intelligence procedures. This will be done by conducting several province-wide studies in Ontario using medical records of youth with disabilities and youth without disabilities followed over time from 1988 to 2023. Disability will be classified as physical (impacting movement), sensory (impacting vision or hearing) and intellectual (impacting cognition). We will identify both physical and mental chronic conditions during the study period from medical records. This study will improve our understanding of multiple chronic conditions among youth with disabilities. This may help create personalized care tools to prevent multiple chronic conditions among youth with disabilities."

Strict visitor policies in hospitals, restrictions on post-death ceremonies (e.g., funerals), social isolation and lack of access to professional support may have significant negative effects on the quality of death (QOD) of individuals dying during the pandemic and put their family members at risk of experiencing severe grief reactions. It is important to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way people die and grieve because this can help improve the support services that are available to families at their most vulnerable time. 

Aim: This 2-year study will recruit bereaved family members of individuals who died of any cause in two hospitals in Toronto, Ontario, in order to evaluate: i) the QOD and bereavement outcomes (depression, post-traumatic stress and complicated grief) and who is at a greater risk for worse QOD and more severe grief reactions; and ii) the experience and perceived met and unmet support needs of bereaved family members. 

Methods: Six months after the patient death, family members of patients who died at the University Health Network or Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre will be asked to complete surveys of the patient's QOD, their satisfaction with and access to care, depression, post-traumatic stress and grief reactions. Participants will also be interviewed about their experience of death and grief. Our research team has experience in interviewing and surveying family members after the death of a loved one in a sensitive and respectful manner. 

Relevance: It is urgent to address the impact of the pandemic on grieving Canadians. Our study will provide real-time evidence to inform policy and clinical guidelines to better support family members before and after patients' deaths and develop interventions to prevent and treat complicated grief and to support bereavement in general during the pandemic and beyond."

A new awareness has dawned internationally regarding the significance of HIV and disability. Meanwhile, Canadians have already demonstrated global leadership regarding the dual experience of HIV and disability. In particular, expertise has been developed regarding disability brought on as a result of HIV/AIDS. We now have the opportunity to study this dual experience in a way that has never before been reported: by exploring the experiences of people with pre-existing disabilities who have become HIV-positive. The population for this study is located in Zambia, where this issue has been identified as a priority by our community partner, the Zambian Disability and HIV/AIDS Trust. The study holds the potential to inform Canada's domestic and foreign HIV policy responses, as well as enhance Canada's expertise on HIV and disability in a way that lays the groundwork for a significant future international contribution.

OBJECTIVES
1. To explore experiences and perceptions of stakeholders (i.e., people with disabilities who are HIV-positive and key informants) in Zambia regarding health equity issues related to HIV care for people with disabilities who are HIV-positive.
-To generate preliminary data towards the pursuit of more comprehensive funding opportunities to address HIV and disability issues.
-To facilitate formation of a new interdisciplinary team of senior and junior researchers from multiple institutions.
2a. To explore how leading thinkers from Canada's HIV sphere and Canada's disability sphere analyze and actualize knowledge gained from Phase 1 of the project for policy, programming and research in relation to their work and their movements in Canada and internationally.  
2b. To use the knowledge gained from Phases 1 and 2a of the project to inform development of a multi-year CIHR Operating Grant proposal to be submitted March 2011 and a CIHR New Investigator Award proposal to be submitted by the PI in fall 2011."

Reducing inequities is a priority for many working in health (e.g., clinicians, health professions educators, policy makers), but there is a major obstacle that prevents lasting change. People commonly do not understand their own positions of unearned advantage (i.e., privilege), and how these are directly related to systems of inequality. For example, white people understanding structural racism; settlers recognizing their ongoing role in colonialism; able-bodied people resisting ableist norms; males dismantling patriarchy; or straight people resisting heteronormativity. This lack of understanding not only reduces the effectiveness of efforts to mitigate health inequities, but unwittingly reinforces the status quo. 

A SOLUTION: We have developed a framework to help clinicians, educators, researchers, policy-makers and others in health understand their personal connections to systems of inequality and, importantly, how to use their unearned advantage to challenge these unfair structures.  We call it the ""Coin Model of Privilege and Allyship"". So far, the Coin Model has been used to educate physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, bioethicists, global health workers, hospital administrators, and public health leaders across Canada to more meaningfully address the root causes of health inequities. However, the focus thus far has been education without a research component.

THE NEXT STEP: Our team of 32 diverse health leaders - led by people who are Black, Indigenous and/or disabled - proposes to collaboratively develop a multi-faceted research program that investigates how the Coin Model of Privilege and Allyship can be used to build the capacity of people working in health, in order to reduce health inequities. We will then identify initial research priorities and create teams across disciplines and sectors to drive these projects forward."

The proposed research program is broadly concerned with Chinese Canadians' experiences of discrimination and stigmatization in the current context of the COVID-19 epidemic. Central to these experiences, we suggest, is non-Chinese Canadians' understanding of risk and the cultural dimensions of preventative health practices. The research program has three interrelated components that, together, will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of how Chinese and non-Chinese Canadians understand, experience, and react to the COVID-19, and have implications for developing strategies to combat stigma and fear associated with Chinese people and COVID-19.  The first study involves a longitudinal study of Chinese Canadians' experiences of discrimination during the COVID-19 epidemic will help determine what kinds of support Chinese Canadians would like to receive now and in the near future. The second study focuses on non-Chinese Canadians' perceptions of risk associated with virus transmission.  This study will test the idea that one way to allay fears aroused by viral outbreaks is to provide people with accurate numerical information about the mortality rate produced by the virus, and its main implication that reducing fear may decrease discrimination against Chinese Canadians. Risk perceptions also predict preventative behaviour. Thus, the third study focuses on wearing a face mask in public as a preventative health practice that is particularly enmeshed in cultural beliefs that differ across the two communities Together, these three interrelated components represent significant social countermeasure research to combat the intergroup threat driven by misinformation, stigma, and cultural misunderstanding associated with COVID-19."

The transition could range from wearing masculine clothing to having medical therapies or surgical procedures. Many transmasculine individuals take testosterone to develop a deeper voice, a male distribution of body fat and muscle mass, and male patterns of hair growth. Some individuals opt for sex reassignment surgeries which might include chest contouring surgery, hysterectomy, and/or phalloplasty. Transmasculine individuals who have not had a hysterectomy are in a unique position, given their gender and biological attributes, to make choices about pregnancy, birthing, and breast/chestfeeding. These men are a minority in maternity care and are often misunderstood by health care providers. The purpose of this study is to interview transmasculine individuals who have given birth and to bring forth their narratives. The interviews will be analyzed for patterns and themes to provide a comprehensive description of their experiences with pregnancy, birthing, and infant feeding. This analysis will: 1) serve as a foundation for further research, 2) be useful for transmen who are considering a pregnancy, and 3) assist in creating resources for health care professionals (e.g., lactation consultants, midwives, nurses, and physicians) to provide appropriate care and support for their transmasculine patients and clients."

Although a growing number of immigrants have turned to self-employment or micro business ownership, there has been virtually no research on the psychosocial factors affecting the health of self-employed immigrants or immigrant micro business owners. Considering that micro businesses account for more than 50% of Canadian businesses and generate over 25% of all jobs in Canada, it is important to determine factors that affect the health of micro business owners, especially among immigrants. Immigrant micro business owners typically manage heavy workloads and endure high levels of physical and mental labour without receiving extra health care benefits or pensions. In the proposed study, the health of immigrant micro-business owners will be examined by comparing micro business ownership to paid employment. The findings of the study will be used to suggest bases for further research on the health implications of other types of self-employment among immigrants."

The quality and quantity of mental health researchers with expertise in social causation has not kept pace with those interested in biology.   The recent World Health Organization report, ""Closing the Gap in a Generation"" underlines the importance of social determinants in improving health and notes improved training of health researchers is vital.  

Sophisticated inter-disciplinary expertise is required to integrate work on social, psychological, and biological causes.  In Canada, an advanced research training program is needed to encourage the development of evidence-based prevention methods and effective ways to deal with the social determinants of recovery.

The Social Aetiology of Mental Illness training program will create a new generation of advanced experts through an interdisciplinary collaboration focusing on the social determinants of mental disorders and models of causation. It will train researchers from diverse fields including medicine, health sciences, social work, and social sciences and produce a new cadre of researchers equipped to investigate causation and ultimately translate into health prevention and promotion initiatives.  It will produce national and international networks of interested professionals that will further build capacity while leading the field.

Or, les interventions qui sont développées autour des valeurs et principes reliés au rétablissement nous amènent à considérer de ce que perçoivent et expriment les différents acteurs (patient, proche, intervenant) à partir de leur propre réalité et dans le contexte de leur interaction. Les raisons qui justifient la participation des 3 acteurs dans ce projet sont que, les patients sont les mieux placés pour exprimer leur besoin face à ce qu'ils vivent; les proches sont témoins de leur évolution et représentent des observateurs-acteurs dont le lien particulier avec ces personnes constitue une source d'information précieuse; les intervenants sont témoins de situations qui leur permettent d'observer l'évolution des patients auprès desquels ils assurent un suivi dans leur milieu de vie. De plus, des études font ressortir le fait que des différences entre ces 3 acteurs concernés par le rétablissement en termes de perceptions, d'interprétations et d'interventions peuvent avoir un impact sur le rapport des personnes à l'alliance thérapeutique et à la continuité du traitement. Ce projet remettra probablement en question certaines positions traditionnelles en mettant l'accent sur ces différences pour développer des interventions ""sur mesure"" axées sur le potentiel et les ressources des personnes plutôt que sur les déficits associés à la maladie.

However, a major challenge for these programs is to extend lifestyle counseling, to persons with hypertension or high risk for cardiovascular events, without burdening available resources. Internet programs of preventive e-counseling may be well-suited to meet this challenge.
 
This proposed clinical trial builds upon the findings of 2 previous trials by our team. In COHRT, we reported short-term improvements in blood pressure and self-reported diet and exercise following preventive telehealth counseling for persons at high risk for cardiovascular disease. In I-START, short-term improvements in blood pressure and self-reported exercise and diet were associated with preventive e-counseling for subjects with hypertension.

This proposed clinical trial, REACH, will enroll 624 persons with hypertension. All subjects will continue with their prescribed medications. Our main objective is to assess whether  preventive e-counseling (provided through a website of the Heart and Stroke Foundation) improves blood pressure and lifestyle behaviors over a long-term, 12-month interval. REACH will also evaluate improvement in lifestyle behaviors (diet, exercise, smoking, and compliance to prescribed medications) using objective and validated measures. Finally, we will quantify the amount of e-counseling support that is required during REACH to evoke a significant reduction in blood pressure. 

The findings of this trial will provide information that is critical to our understanding of how internet-based programs can help to improve blood pressure and to reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease."

Counseling by multidisciplinary health care teams helps CHF patients to improve self-care behaviors (for medications, diet, exercise, smoking cessation and symptom monitoring), and this reduces the rate of death and CHF hospitalization. In the absence of intervention, patient adherence to these behaviors is below recommended standards and quality of life among CHF patients becomes progressively compromised. A major challenge is to make self-care counseling available without overtaxing health care resources.

This 3.5 year proposal will establish and evaluate a Canadian e-based program of multidisciplinary counseling to help CHF patients initiate and maintain recommended self-care behaviors. We will recruit 278 CHF patients in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. We hypothesize that a 12-month program of e-Counseling + Usual Care vs. general eInfo + Usual Care will improve quality of life, self-care behaviors and heart health. This proposal is based upon previous clinical trials in CHF, e-health and preventive lifestyle counseling by our team. It builds upon our established collaboration with the consumer eHealth program of the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Ontario. The novel contribution of this research is that it will establish an infrastructure for a pan-Canadian e-platform in preventive e-counseling for CHF. A key feature of this proposal is that our multidisciplinary team will work with the Heart and Stroke Foundation to share our findings and e-health resources with the public and other health care professionals in Canada, which will help to galvanize research and clinical work in eCounseling.

To help improve health outcomes associated this critical time of transition from a correctional facility to community, Correctional Health Services (CHS) has implemented Community Transition Teams (CTTs) in BC. CTTs adopt a client-centred approach to care, where a case manager works closely with an individual to help them identify their priorities and takes an active role in supporting them to achieve their treatment goals following release from provincial corrections. While the implementation of CTTs in correctional settings in BC is confirmed to proceed, no formal evaluation of the impact such an evidence-based treatment approach may have on resulting health or social outcomes for this high-risk population has yet been proposed. To address this, the proposed research will evaluate the impact of CTT participation on health and social outcomes among incarcerated individuals with opioid addiction, as well as identify relevant barriers impeding successful scale-up of CTTs within BC. Participants will complete a one-time questionnaire and provide consent to the use of their personal identifiers for linkage to a variety of healthcare databases for ongoing community follow-up over a 5-year period. A sample of participants will also be invited to participate in a cross-sectional qualitative interview to identify existing barriers or challenges associated with the successful implementation or scale-up of CTTs, and to identify feasible solutions.

Hesitancy to seek sexual healthcare can produce negative health outcomes for SDMM such as sexually transmitted blood-borne infections (STBBIs). Presenting later can also increase the resources required from the Canadian healthcare system. It is therefore critical to investigate the unique sexual health needs of SDMM, the extent to which the Canadian healthcare system is equipped to address them, and the factors contributing to SDMM's reluctance to seek sexual healthcare. The ultimate goal of the study is to identify pathways to improve sexual healthcare services for SDMM in Canada. A qualitative approach will be adopted to gather comprehensive information about SDMM and the Canadian healthcare system in three phases. The first phase will include interviewing 25-30 SDMM about their engagement in STBBI protective behaviors and their lived experiences of seeking sexual healthcare in Manitoban health facilities. The interviews will also allow SDMM to reflect on their most recent medical/clinical encounter, so gaps in the delivery of sexual healthcare for SDMM are identified. In the second phase, 25-30 sexual healthcare providers will be interviewed to explore their perspectives on the intersectionality of SDMM and how it impacts access to, utilization, and delivery of sexual healthcare. In the third phase, 4-5 hybrid seminars with policy actors will be conducted to discuss the study findings and obtain their suggestions about policymaking for the sexual healthcare of SDMM. The study will help generate three major outputs: new evidence about Canadian SDMM, an advocacy plan, and a model for policy and practice. Researching SDMM is critical to better equip the Canadian healthcare system to deal with diverse population groups, with unique health needs."

The project will centre Cree Elders and knowledge holders in addressing three research questions: how has colonialism impacted Cree gender formations, specifically the values, roles and responsibilities of boys and men; what is the relationship between Cree values, practices, identities and wellness; how can Cree values and embodied practices be re-membered and reclaimed in fostering the resurgence of tribally-specific roles and responsibilities of boys and men. This project focuses on cisgendered Cree boys and men, not to the exclusion of diverse genders, but as part of a relational ecology. It is our contention that Cree ways of life represent a critical pathway to re-balancing the relationships between boys and men, diverse genders, communities, and the Cree Nation, all of which lead to holistic, Indigenous-centred, health and wellness.

Existing guidelines recommend waiting from at least 18 to 24 months following previous childbirth until becoming pregnant again. It is not known, however, whether these guidelines suitable for all women.  Women with a prior history of poor outcomes might have different optimal interpregnancy interval pertinent to them and waiting for 18 months might be associated with adverse outcomes. For example, among women who had pregnancy loss, current recommendations to wait 18 months before their next pregnancy may prolong their grief and emotional stress, whereas for women with a history of subfertility, waiting the recommended 18 months may increase their risk of infertility due to advancing maternal age. 
 
In this project, we will study whether associations between short intervals and adverse outcomes are the same or different among women with poor outcomes in the first pregnancy (fetal or newborn death, history of infertility treatment, or preterm delivery) and among women without poor outcomes in the first pregnancy. This will help us to create guidelines on optimal birth spacing for women with the poor outcomes in their first pregnancies. 
 
Methods: We will use a high-quality, population-based cohort including all pregnancies in British Columbia from 2004 to 2014 to examine relationships between pregnancy spacing interval and adverse outcomes (fetal or newborn mortality, poor fetal growth, preterm delivery) for women with a fetal or newborn death, infertility treatment, or preterm birth in the first pregnancy.

However, the actual impact of mifepristone introduction on abortion access, outcomes, and costs in Canada is not yet known. Also, countries around the world seek to understand the effects of Canada's unique deregulation of medical abortion.

In this study, we will measure the impact of mifepristone introduction on abortion access, outcomes, and costs using Canada's comprehensive health administrative data.

Research question: How has mifepristone medical abortion affected abortion access and service distribution, adverse event rates, and health system costs in Canada?

Methods: This study uses linked population-based health administrative data to examine abortion outcomes, access, and costs for abortions before and after mifepristone introduction, in British Columbia and Ontario.

Our team has conducted foundational mifepristone implementation research engaging health policy, system, service decision makers as well as health professionals. Federal and provincial health policymakers and system leaders are integrated into our research team to facilitate timely improvements. This study builds on our prior work which supports integrated knowledge translation of the results.

Impact: This will be the first comprehensive examination of abortion services in Canada following mifepristone introduction, and will enable health policy, system and service delivery decision makers to further equitable access to safe, effective abortion care for patients across Canada and around the world."

Many socio-economically marginalized people who use drugs rely on social assistance, prohibited sources of income, and high risk borrowing and bartering that are major sources of violence and trauma. Previous studies have not adequately examined poverty and income generation, individual financial management strategies and their applicability to health, economic and social policy. Prior economic analyses have focused on the effects of price on demand for licit psychoactive substances due to the ability to alter the price through taxation or subsidization to minimize harmful use. Successful reductions in cigarette consumption through taxation and other means serve as a critical example. In the absence of such policy options, given the criminalization of illicit drugs, focusing on income generation as a central lever in relieving poverty and decreasing drug-related harm may yield substantial benefits. Additionally, prior studies have demonstrated the harmful impacts of synchronized monthly social assistance (SA) disbursement, including escalations in high-intensity drug use, overdose, hospital discharge against medical advice, drug and alcohol related death, public disorder, and spikes in demand for key services. The proposed project will determine the potential differential effects of legal and prohibited income on drug consumption; examine the impacts of drug debt accumulation, borrowing and bartering and criminal activity on health and social outcomes; determine whether alternative SA payments will reduce societal costs and improve health; and explore the experiences and unanticipated consequences of alternative SA disbursement arrangements.

Food insecurity in Canadian cities and the role of provincial poverty reduction policies,"['Notten, Geranda']","['Tarasuk, Valerie S']","['Canadian Cities', 'Food Insecurity', 'Policy', 'Poverty', 'Poverty Reduction', 'Provincial Policies']",75000.0,421847,"Household food insecurity, insecure or inadequate access to food due to financial constraints, is a measure of severe poverty-level living conditions and a potent social determinant of health in Canada. It is also a pervasive problem in Canadian cities with food insecurity rates among census metropolitan areas ranging from 9.7% in Quebec City to 17.2% in Halifax (2015/16).

Food insecurity among urban households presents an ongoing challenge to the vision of 'healthy cities'. Municipal governments frankly acknowledge their limited ability to address the problems of poverty that underpin food insecurity. Cities' social safety nets significantly rely on provincial and federal sources of funding and the social programs most influential in reducing food insecurity fall under provincial and federal jurisdiction. 

This is an exceptionally opportune moment for conducting a secondary data analysis to study the influence of provincial and federal policy actions on food insecurity rates in Canadian cities. There is now sufficient micro-data available from the Canadian Community Health Surveys (CCHS: 2005-2018) for a simultaneous inter-jurisdictional (cities and provinces) and temporal trend analysis of food insecurity. This period also captures a period during which poverty reduction gradually became a political priority for successive higher-level governments.

Our proposed research will determine how policy actions at higher levels of government have influenced food insecurity rates in cities, laying the foundation for more coordinated actions across these levels of government to address food insecurity effectively. We will exploit provincial variation in the timing and scope of policy actions to assess how they influence the prevalence and severity of food insecurity in cities. We propose to address the research question: What has been the macro-level effect of poverty reduction policies at higher levels of government on food insecurity in Canadian cities (2005-2018)?"
Clarifying ethical and evidence-based values of beneficiary input for humanitarian healthcare missions,"['Nouvet, Elysee A']",['N/A'],"['Bioethics', 'Cross-Cultural Health Transactions', 'Global Health Ethics', 'Healthcare Ethics', 'Humanitarianism', 'Qualitative Assessments Of Healthcare']",90000.0,280031,"Medical humanitarian missions set up clinics and operating theatres for the poorest throughout the world with the intention of alleviating their suffering in the absence of adequate or affordable local health services and medicines. The question is, do the choices made by medical volunteers, often in clinically and culturally unfamiliar contexts, coincide with the expectations and priorities of beneficiaries? What role can and should suggestions from beneficiary communities play in shaping what medical missionaries do or aim to do? Combining analysis of existing policies and empirical research, and working in collaboration with Canada's leading humanitarian healthcare ethics research team, this evidence-based study seeks to improve the effective and ethical delivery of healthcare services in humanitarian settings. Ensuring there is resonance between medical aid and beneficiary values and needs is central to safeguarding and improving the ethical performance of medical humanitarian projects. As federal funding for international aid interventions comes under increasing pressure due to global financial pressures, yet global disasters and demand for aid increase, it is crucial to make best use of available funds. The better understanding of beneficiary experiences of medical missions this study yields will inform the training and preparation of healthcare professionals for medical missions in unfamiliar cultural and clinical contexts, while providing guidelines on how beneficiary input can be integrated into humanitarian healthcare planning and delivery to ensure limited resources are strategically situated to do the most good."
Effect of varying length of stair nosing on foot trajectory during stair ascent and descent in healthy older adults: Influencing design standards to reduce risk of falls on stairs,"['Novak, Alison']",['N/A'],"['Aging-In-Place', 'Biomechanics', 'Environmental Influences On Health', 'Ergonomics', 'Falls Prevention', 'Mobility', 'Public Health', 'Universal Design']",2500.0,331860,"Stairs are one of the most hazardous locations of any home or public environment, particularly for older adults given declines in physical function associated with healthy aging.  Many factors contribute to the increased risk of falls on stairs, although very few studies have focused on the impact of design and risk of falls. Such information is critical to guiding safe stair design and impacting falls at a population-based level. The present study examined the effect of stair design features on risk of falls while individuals walk up and down stairs.  Data was collected and analyzed from 6 of 20 healthy older adults while they walked up and down a 6-step staircase without handrail use (data analysis for the full sample size is ongoing). We systematically varied stair features, including the length of the nosing projection beyond the step edge. Our laboratory-derived biomechanical measures permitted investigation of small differences in the performance of built environment features and the relative reduction in risk of falls. The study findings will be used to advocate for improved stair safety and formulate effective recommendations for changes to the current building codes in Canada and world-wide."
The Care Pathways and Health Service Needs of People with Early-Onset Dementia: A Mixed Methods Study,"['Novek, Sheila B']",['N/A'],"['Barriers To Care', 'Caregivers', 'Dementia Care', 'Early-Onset Dementia', 'Long-Term Care', 'Mixed Methods Research']",105000.0,327879,"Alzheimer's Disease was first identified in a woman in her fifties, but today it is commonly regarded as a disease of old age. Though persons with early-onset dementia (EOD) (onset before 65) played a seminal role in the early understanding of the disease, they are underrepresented in the contemporary literature on dementia. Younger people living with dementia have many of the same needs as older adults, but because EOD affects people during a different phase of the life course, they tend to have additional needs and challenges. 

Objectives: 1) To compare the health characteristics of people with EOD and late-onset dementia (LOD); 2) To identify the care pathways and service needs of people with EOD across the continuum of care; and 3) To develop recommendations to improve services for people with EOD and their families.

Methods: The research will employ a mixed methods approach to provide a comprehensive examination of the needs and care pathways of people with EOD. Secondary analysis of the Survey on Living with Neurological Conditions in Canada (SLNCC) will examine and compare the demographic characteristics, health, and care use of people with EOD and LOD. Qualitative interviews with people with EOD and their caregivers will complement survey data by exploring in-depth how patients and their families navigate available health and support services. 

Contribution: This study will identify ways to improve existing services to better meet the needs of younger people with dementia. The research will also inform the planning of specialized services and programs for this population."

As governments, researchers and the public contemplate nursing home policy reform, there is an urgent need to ensure that residents and family carers can meaningfully engage in policy and service design. User engagement initiatives, which broadly refer to involving people with lived experience in service or policy development, have gained prominence in the health sector to promote quality improvement and democratic processes. In nursing home settings, resident and/or family councils are commonly required as a mechanism for engaging service users. However, little known about these forums, or the extent to which they enable residents and families to influence program or policy changes. My postdoctoral research will address this gap through a comparative ethnographic study of user engagement in nursing homes in two Canadian provinces (British Columbia and Manitoba). Using a combination of document analysis, participant observation and interviews, the purpose of this study is to explore whether and how resident and family councils enable residents and family carers to assert their rights and engage in decision-making processes, and to identify strategies to enhance user engagement in nursing homes."

Aboriginal persons living with HIV/AIDS (APLWHA) are less likely than non-APLWHA to access and adhere to HIV drug therapy. However, the evidence to date has aimed for generalization and not focused enough on contextual factors. Furthermore, research on HIV drug therapy remains largely siloed in its approach to generating knowledge, not fully taking advantage of interdisciplinary understanding despite the fact that HIV drug treatment access, acceptance and adherence occurs within a context beyond the disease itself and involves structural (e.g., social, cultural), behavioural as well as biomedical (e.g., drug effectiveness, drug side-effects) issues that intersect, creating a complex environment. Moreover, no studies have been conducted examining the combined effect of these factors on HIV drug therapy specific to APLWHA. The objective of my research is to explore and explain factors affecting HIV drug therapy among APLWHA by modeling this complex system. My research question is: What is the relationship between personal, interpersonal, and structural factors and APLWHA health outcomes? I will use a systems science framework incorporating a participatory action research design. My study population will include APLWHA, service providers, and other key informants in one Canadian province. I will collect data using interviews and surveys to create a model, analyze that data using thematic analysis and statistics, and then interpret the study results. The aim of my study is to create new knowledge that can be applied by interested parties to develop effective health systems, services and policies to support APLWHA within the context of HIV drug therapy. Finally, my proposed research has implications for fostering multi-stakeholder engagement and collaboration to ensure a comprehensive approach to addressing HIV drug therapy access, acceptance and adherence among APLWHA."

This three-day meeting of international and Canadian experts will think about and decide how video-playback can be used to understand and improve health care communication and information sharing. Those present will be consumers, policy makers, health professionals and researchers. Problems in communication and information-sharing need serious thought and debate before doing studies. Most attempts to solve this problem have not worked. This is because there are serious but hidden problems in what people believe about health and how health services are arranged, which make it difficult to share information properly. For example, health organizations are arranged based on particular knowledge and separate parts of the human body. This requires an extra special effort, not supported naturally by the way health services are arranged, to ensure smooth information-flow. The problems are so big that many researchers and policy-makers ignore them and only work on small parts of the problem.

Videos can improve health services in local units despite these problems. Its images and sounds are so strong that people feel emotionally driven to make changes to their roles and local workplaces. In local workplaces, positive relationships can overcome the problems stated above. Since these problems happen across whole health systems, the goal of the meeting of experts is to see if the powerful ability of video recordings to push for change in health services can do the same at a larger level where policy and financial decisions are made. The meeting will provide a detailed five-year research plan for studies, and papers and talks from the studies and the meeting itself, and practical projects to improve the way clinicians work together and share information."

The ED's busyness also promises lessons for other health services on what makes health services work well together or not. When ED patient sorting is not done well, patients can die or be harmed, and it costs the health system a lot of money. The sorting out role is happening more poorly in Canada than other similar countries. Attempts to fix the problem over 30 years have looked mainly at technology, and in only one place. But these problems also happen because of how people work together in different places. So, patients are waiting longer and longer. This research looks to find out how people can work together better and how patient sorting can be improved. Our observers will spend a lot of time with a small number of carefully selected doctors, in two EDs in two Canadian cities. We will listen, observe and write notes of what they say and do with others. We will then ask doctors, nurses, community professionals and patients for their views on sorting patients to go to different places. Different researchers will read and summarize many times typed documents of what we see and hear. We will see what is similar and different in behaviours and views, to say how staff can work together better. We will share the lessons from this study by writing papers for other researchers, and also making presentations. We will give specific advice on how health staff can be better taught to arrange care, and how the places in which they work can help this. The findings of the study will help researchers, and people who teach and make health decisions, to improve the way health care organizations in general can help future health workers to care for patients properly, by sending them to the right people, in the right place at the right time."

In 2009, Grindr was introduced as a mobile app for smartphones to allow MSMs to see the profiles of other men in their vicinity (using GPS technology) and to use the ""chat"" function to talk to them. This app is commonly known as a ""hook-up"" app for people to contact other men for the purposes of sexual encounters. This app quickly became the most popular of its kind and as of 2014 there have been 10 million user downloads since its inception and 5 million accessing monthly. The challenge for those working in HIV and STI prevention is that despite the education campaign to reduce HIV and other STIs among MSMs, infections continue to occur at a higher rate among this subgroup of the population. 

We believe that the increased availability of sexual encounters through mobile devices may contribute to the continued spread of HIV and for the recent outbreak of other STIs among MSM. This research seeks to provide new insight into how mobile apps can be (re)considered in HIV and STIs prevention."

Since Covid-19 there has been a recent and drastic digital shift of the 2SGBTQS community, that has fueled new risks to 2SGBTQS men's health, especially among those who use SNAs to sell sex. For example, sex work can increase the risk of contracting HIV and other STBBIs. 2SGBTQS men choose to participate in sex work for a variety of reasons, including as a chosen career as well as a forced source of income. The COVID-19 pandemic has further endangered sex workers by forcing many to stop in-person services, reduce the number of clients they can service, or adapt their services to occur online-only. Despite these and other health and safety risks, little is known about men who sell sex and the associated risks, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic era.

Despite the high rates of SDU and SV among GBT2SQ men, both of which are reported to have increased during the Covid-19 pandemic, few studies have investigated how SDU and SV impact the sexual and mental health of GBT2SQ men. With the pandemic, GBT2SQ men are also relying on online technologies to connect now more than ever. However, the strategies that GBT2SQ men who use online technologies employ to promote their health remain under-researched.

Prenatal exposure to heavy metals such as arsenic and mercury has been associated with reproductive risk and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes. This study will use a prospective longitudinal approach to examine the association between level of exposure to arsenic and mercury prenatally and reproductive outcomes and early developmental outcomes of infant born in ASGM communities in Geita District, Northwestern Tanzania. We will recruit pregnant women attending antenatal clinics from communities in areas with a long history of ASGM and collect unprovoked urine samples and dried blood spots as biomarkers of arsenic and mercury exposure respectively. These women will be compared to a group of pregnant women from areas without ASGM activities in Northern Tanzania for level of exposure to arsenic and mercury. Recruited pregnant women in ASGM areas will be followed and data on birth status (i.e., live birth, still birth), visible birth defects (i.e., cleft lip/palate, neural tube defects, limb defects), infant anthropometric status at birth (i.e., weight, length, head and chest circumference), and infant growth (i.e., weight, length, head and chest circumference) development at 6 months of age will be obtained. Associations between exposure levels and the various outcome measures will be examined. The results of this study will provide important information to the public, policy makers, health professionals and the research community on level of exposure of pregnant women to these toxicants and the impact of this exposure on birth outcomes and infant health development due to ASGM."

Specifically, the tool will be shared with practitioners, community organizations, municipalities, the general public, policy developers and advocates across Canada. The Policy Readiness Tool (PRT, www.policyreadinesstool.com) is a short tool that helps users to a) assess a municipality's readiness for policy change, and then b) target their actions using evidence-based strategies and resources. While the PRT is currently available online in a PDF format, a recent evaluation has indicated that users are interested in more. We propose to: create an online version of the PRT to assess readiness for policy change; update the resources provided; create an online community for PRT-users to share their experiences, educate users about the PRT, and facilitate discussions about its use; and evaluate how well this all works. This dissemination activity will ensure that the PRT is used in practice. It will increase user's knowledge about policy development and implementation. This is very important because healthy public policy is a key strategy for reducing chronic disease and improving health. In addition, while individuals, organizations, and communities may see the potential of implementing policy, they may lack the training, experience or resources to do so. The sharing of this user-friendly, evidence-based tool across Canada will help practitioners and lay users to do this."

Given the tremendous growth of the community, and increasing demand for physical activity opportunities, the Strathcona County Council approved the Open Space and Recreation Facility Strategy (OSRFS). Specific to this proposal, the goal of the OSRFS is to meet a variety of user needs and ensure equitable access while maintaining current service quality levels. To do this, the County will reinvest in existing facilities to maximize use (before new infrastructure is constructed) and will partner with other sectors to offer equitable access, shared benefits, and efficient use of community resources. The County has invested $40M in Phase 1A to revitalize existing indoor recreation and outdoor facilities. Groundbreaking for Phase 1A has occurred; facilities revitalized during Phase 1A will re-open in Fall 2011. This presents a time-sensitive opportunity to evaluate the impact of this investment.

We will evaluate the OSRFS implementation by examining barriers to access across the profile of current users relative to non-users in Strathcona County, in comparison to user and non-users of a community similar size and facility profile (Spruce Grove/Stony Plain/Parkland County). Stage 1 will involve a before-and-after (facility re-opening) telephone survey of residents in each community. Stage 2 will involve before-and-after focus groups of (1) current users, (2) potential users, and (3) non-users in both communities. Focus groups will explore issue of who uses facilities (why/why not), preferences for and barriers to use, how people get to facilities, etc. Data collected in Stages 1 and 2 will be supplemented by facility use statistics, user-group profiles made, and maps of where in the community users are coming from."

The social and physical environments of early childhood have changed profoundly in the last 50 years, as a result of urbanization, changing family demographics and technology.  Play spaces and play experiences are increasingly structured, organized and institutionalized.  Strathcona County Recreation, Parks and Culture (RPC) has recognized the importance of encouraging free play amongst children and has invested $350,000 into the development of LovetoPlay: a unique, leading edge, and innovative play-based preschool space and program.  LovetoPlay aims to enhance preschool children's developmental experiences by focusing on open-ended, play-based learning in a purposively designed environment. It will begin in January 2014. This presents a time-sensitive opportunity to evaluate the impact of this investment.

We will evaluate LovetoPlay by looking at how play is fostered in the environment, while exploring parental, instructors' and children's perspectives, in comparison to 2 preschool spaces of similar size and also operated by RPC.  Part 1 will involve before and after interviews with parents and instructors at each preschool site.  Part 2 will assess the physical features in each of the preschool spaces.  In Part 3 the nature of children's play behaviours will be observed multiple times in each space.  Part 4 will involve working directly with the children to have them share their stories, take pictures, and map and tour adults around the preschool spaces.  This research will contribute to our understanding of the design and program features that facilitate play and promote health in institutionalized program settings for young children."

Also because of COVID-19, people are facing unprecedented levels of financial strain due to the economic market collapse, job loss, social isolation, illness, and increased caring duties. Financial strain is the feeling of being unable to make ends meet. It occurs when people cannot pay their bills, feel worried about money, and experience negative impacts on their quality of life and health. Adults under financial strain are at higher risk of depression, anxiety, work absenteeism, and poor physical health. Their children are prone to loneliness, depression, poor mental health, and disability into adulthood. The COVID-19 related public health response to financial strain will be vital now and for societal recovery. PURPOSE: Our team will develop a public health framework on financial strain, as well an indicator tool-kit relevant to diverse settings and groups. This research is focused on the consequences of the sudden collapse of a system as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings could also help offset financial strain during other public health emergencies. APPROACH: This proposal builds on our previous work on financial strain. We propose a multi-method comparative study, organized as four parts, and occurring in Canada and Australia. Part 1 involves a rapid realist review and international environmental scan to community-led and government strategies to address financial strain and health impacts. We will also do a policy review of government policies on COVID-related financial strain. Part 2 is interviews with government representatives (multiple levels) and organizations addressing financial strain. A financial strain framework will be developed from Parts 1+2. Part 3 will identify relevant indicators to guide action and lead to a tool-kit for practitioners. Part 4 is the involvement of two Practice Advisory Committees (CDA and AUS) in all project activities."

The worst impacts are felt among racialized peoples, women and younger people. Funded by CIHR, our international, multi-sectoral practice-research team developed a Public Health Framework and companion Guidebook. These evidence-based resources will help governments and organizations promote financial wellbeing at the population level. The Framework presents 17 areas for action. The Guidebook offers strategies and indicators to act on those areas. They are in PDF-document form, but knowledge users (KU) have strongly recommended an interactive website to better meet their needs. Our integrated knowledge translation (iKT) project aims to strengthen awareness and use of the Framework & Guidebook. We will work closely with KU to create a user-friendly website where users can seek guidance from the Framework & Guidebook tailored directly to their needs. Building on our work since 2018, we propose a participatory, multi-method project. We will: 1) work with KU to generate ideas and a website prototype; 2) refine and validate the website with a national end-user group, prioritizing equity-deserving groups; 3) co-develop end-of-grant KT strategies to share with diverse target audiences; 4) evaluate our process of working with KU and end-users to inform our work and add to the iKT literature; and 5) evaluate the project outcomes of reach, effectiveness, adoption, sustainability, and equity. Our project responds to a practice need and gaps in the academic literature. We will substantially improve awareness and uptake of these action-oriented resources among diverse end-users. This will improve their work on the design, delivery, and evaluation of programs and policies on poverty, financial strain and financial wellbeing. Our work will also address scholarly gaps on KT of systems-oriented frameworks that guide complex population-level initiatives."

Financial struggles make adults and children ill, physically and mentally. Women, seniors, Black people, Indigenous peoples, and immigrants have struggled more than anyone else. It is time for us to look beyond what people can learn to manage their finances better. We need to look at the causes of their financial problems (e.g., lack of job training; no affordable childcare facilities). Public health is well positioned to make a contribution to this topic. It can present solutions that address the causes and consequences of financial struggles and create fair, equitable chances for everyone to enjoy financial stability. Our team did that. With funding from CIHR, an international group of researchers, practitioners, policymakers, and stakeholders developed two resources to support organizations and governments to act on financial wellbeing. Since the release in 2022, we have delivered some presentations to introduce those two resources. The current funding opportunity will support our team to share important information with the general public about the importance of financial wellbeing for health. The objectives of the proposed Café: 1) increase awareness about how financial wellbeing impacts health; 2) talk about addressing the root causes of financial struggles and why we need to act quickly to meet the needs of people from all walks of life; 3) share the resources we developed; 4) discuss key learnings from the work that Alberta Health Services is doing to reduce the impact of financial strain; and 5) provide an opportunity for the general public to dialogue with researchers, decision-makers, and organizational partners about the causes and consequences of poor financial wellbeing. Participants will leave the Café more aware and equipped to discuss, advocate for change, and take action on the causes of poor financial wellbeing."
Prendre soin d'un animal de compagnie: comprendre l'équilibre entre les bienfaits et les contraintes de cette occupation pour soutenir l'autonomie et la sécurité des aînés fragiles vivant dans la communauté,"['Obradovic, Natasa']",['N/A'],"[""Bourse De Voyage D'Aci""]",1000.0,400294,"Au Canada, les aînés de 65 ans et plus constituent 16,9 % de la population, et cette proportion devrait atteindre 25 % en 2036. Ce vieillissement de la population s'accompagne d'une augmentation importante du nombre d'aînés fragiles. La majorité de ces aînés souhaitant vieillir chez soi le plus longtemps possible, plusieurs services communautaires sont mis en place pour favoriser leur maintien à domicile. Des études suggèrent toutefois que près d'un aîné sur cinq vit un isolement social et de l'ennui, ce qui est associé à une diminution de leur état fonctionnel, de leur santé et une augmentation de la mortalité. Pour répondre à ces besoins non comblés, les animaux de compagnie s'avèrent une avenue prometteuse à explorer. En effet, de nombreuses études suggèrent que les interactions avec un animal peuvent être bénéfiques pour la santé et que la participation dans des activités signifiantes améliore le bien-être des aînés. Toutefois, s'occuper d'un animal de compagnie s'accompagne de certaines contraintes et peut comporter un risque pour l'aîné et l'animal de compagnie, surtout si les exigences liées à cette activité excèdent les capacités du propriétaire vieillissant. Ce projet de recherche a donc pour but de mieux comprendre l'importance et l'influence des animaux de compagnie dans le quotidien des aînés fragiles vivant dans la communauté (p.ex. : structure et routine), en plus de l'exploration de l'équilibre entre bienfaits et les risques associés à cette activité. Des entrevues seront réalisées auprès d'aînés fragiles propriétaires d'animaux de compagnie et vivant dans la communauté ainsi que des ergothérapeutes travaillant en soutien à domicile. Ces nouvelles connaissances aideront à identifier des interventions susceptibles de maximiser les bienfaits associés aux animaux de compagnie, tout en diminuant les risques pour les aînés fragiles en vue de favoriser leur autonomie, leur maintien à domicile et leur qualité de vie."

Rather than have parents as passive observers in the NICU while healthcare professionals take over the role of looking after their baby, FICare enables parents to be the main caregiver for their baby as a partner in the NICU care team. Parents are taught how to provide their baby's day-to-day care, monitor their baby's condition, and play an active role in care decisions. Nurses provide the more technical aspects of care, and coach and support parents. Being actively involved in their baby's care strengthens the parent-infant relationship, and helps parents better understand and respond to their baby's needs. A pilot study of FICare demonstrated improved infant growth, an increase in the rate of breast feeding, fewer infections and less parent stress. Presently, a national study is ongoing in 18 Canadian hospitals to confirm these benefits of FICare in the NICU. A unique opportunity exists to examine whether FICare positively affects the children when they reach 18 months of age. Reduced parental stress and positive parent-infant interactions established during FICare may continue after babies go home and may result in a positive impact on child behaviour. This research study will test whether premature babies cared for in the FICare program have better social and emotional development at 18 months from their due date (corrected age) compared with premature babies who were not cared for in the FICare program. The results of this study will be used to support the use of FICare as the standard of care in the NICU."

This research aims at exploring this sequence in an effort to gain a better understanding of the motivations of MSMHA so as to develop more culturally sensitive HIV prevention initiatives. In other words, the goal of this project is to better understand how desire helps guide the selection of specific sexual practices and places, and how this process is also guided by public and personal perceptions of stigma. Qualitative methods will be used to explore these four dimensions as they relate to MSMHA who arrange sexual contacts via the Internet. More specifically, this will involve analysis of the websites which are used to arrange sexual contacts, in addition to 45 in-depth qualitative interviews with men in Montreal, Ottawa, and Toronto."

Findings from a CIHR-funded project by O'Byrne and Gagnon indicate that, in the absence of research about public health practice and nondisclosure prosecutions, public health nurses/physicians use the criminal law to structure their practice. In particular, public health practitioners pointed out that the public health practice of HIV/STI prevention counselling (regarding, for example, individuals who are undergoing HIV testing or who have already been diagnosed with HIV) has been informed by the law related to nondisclosure prosecutions, rather than research or professional guidelines. We propose to undertake a planning meeting to develop a Canada-specific research agenda on nondisclosure prosecutions and HIV-related public health practices and outcomes. In developing such a research agenda, we will privilege the expertise and experience of public health nurses and physicians regarding the types, sources, and scope of information / knowledge essential to the development of policy and practice in this area.

It is known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). 

While most PrEP programs rely on persons' deciding they wish to initiate this interventions, this approach leads to a self-selection bias, in which persons who use PrEP are those who feel they are at-risk for HIV, not necessarily those who are at-risk.

While it is important that anyone who wants to start PrEP should be able to, it is also important to know why persons who are at high-risk for HIV do not use this intervention. 

In Ottawa, we operate an active-offer nurse-led PrEP service (PrEP-RN), in which public health nurses automatically offer a PrEP referral to anyone who is identified as an HIV contact, and anyone who is diagnosed with infectious syphilis or >1 rectal bacterial sexually transmitted infection (specifically gonorrhea or chlamydia). These criteria were selected because they have published 100-person-year HIV incidence rates ranging from 5.0 to 17.3. In the first 6 months of PrEP-RN operations, we have offered over over 120 of such referrals, with an uptake rate that is less than half. 

We now wish to update the literature on PrEP and PrEP delivery, and engage in interviews with persons who declined PrEP-RN to better understand how and why they did so. Specifically, we will perform a state-of-the-art literature review to update what is known about PrEP. We will then engage in an exploratory qualitative study involving semi-structured interviews. We will interview approximately 30 participants. We will perform thematic analysis of the interview data. Our goals are to better understand these persons' understandings of HIV risk, transmission, and prevention, so as to inform future PrEP initiatives."

This Research Program will increase our knowledge about the best ways to coordinate services and policies from outside of the health care system in order to address inner city health inequities. Relevant sectors may include housing, community and newcomer services, and education. This type of coordination is called ""Intersectoral Action for Health"" (ISA).

Although the idea of ISA is very popular, governments and researchers agree that limited evidence is available to guide decision-makers about how to implement, sustain, or evaluate such complex and long-term policy initiatives. Fortunately, consensus is building around the kind of research needed to understand intersectoral pathways to health equity, including: evidence synthesis, health equity indicator development, evaluations and case studies, cost-benefit analysis, and creation of longitudinal datasets to measure interventions over time. Our Program will contribute to building this much-needed knowledge base, in collaboration with service providers and policy makers from diverse sectors and levels of government. We will begin with projects in Toronto, Hamilton, and Brampton, where intersectoral action for health equity is unfolding. Then we will expand to other cities, including Vancouver, Ottawa, and Calgary.

This Program is based at Centre for Inner City Health, St. Michael's Hospital (a teaching hospital affiliated with the University of Toronto). The scientists in this Program are internationally recognized for research excellence in social epidemiology, geography, health economics and health services research, social sciences, and knowledge translation (KT). They also have excellent reputations as responsible and responsive community partners, who work with service providers, policy makers, and communities to address health inequities.

Women from South Asia (i.e. Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka) have breast and cervical cancer screening rates lower than those of their peers. These patterns of inequity for South Asians can continue after many years of residency.  Broad community participation is needed to understand the complex causes of cancer screening inequities and improve the reach of population-based screening programs.  This study is Phase II of a three phase strategy to engage Ontario's Peel Region, an area with a large South Asian population and low cancer screening rates, to implement interventions to increase cancer screening among South Asians.  The overall strategy is being conducted in partnership with the provincial overseer of cancer screening programs and regional community leaders.  Phase I will determine community-identified barriers to cancer screening.  The aims of the current proposal, Phase II of the strategy, are to:  
1.Establish an advisory group of residents, primary care providers, non-clinical community groups, and public health agencies to engage in on-going knowledge exchange meetings with researchers throughout the two-year study.
Participate with the advisory group to:
2.Select evidence-based intervention strategies to address barriers to cancer screening among South Asians in Peel.
3.Establish a network of public health agencies, community service groups, and primary care providers to tailor and implement the intervention strategies.
4.Pre-test the intervention strategies to assess reach, acceptability, and feasibility.
This study will increase collective problem-solving skills among community members to implement health promotion strategies, and implement intervention strategies that will be evaluated in Phase III to determine the effectiveness to increase use of cancer screening among South Asians in Peel."

Across all health conditions, lower income families and individuals face highest rates of illness and experience greatest unmet need for health care. This is especially true in low-income urban neighbourhoods, where residents may face deep poverty, homelessness or unstable housing, social exclusion, family disruption, substance abuse and mental health disorders, barriers to service utilization, and social and economic isolation. During the last two decades, Canada has fallen behind many other nations in taking action to address health inequity. Relevant interventions research and strong cross-sectoral partnerships are needed to generate better evidence of ""what works and why"" in the Canadian context, and to move evidence into action. ACHIEVE will provide a training platform for new scientists to develop skills in complex interventions research and to work effectively in partnership with inner city health service providers, policy makers, and stakeholders. Over the course of this intensive, two-year program, Fellows will develop competencies that are unavailable through traditional graduate training yet necessary for closing the gap between monitoring urban health disparities and reducing them. ACHIEVE will be based at the Centre for Research on Inner City Health at St. Michael's Hospital.

Objectives: To build capacity in the design, piloting, evaluation, implementation, and scaling of interventions to reduce environmental, social, and health inequities in cities by: 
1. Establishing and applying best practices in academic, professional, and experiential education in implementation science and solutions-based research;
2. Developing a core and interdisciplinary set of competencies among learners (trainees and knowledge users) that can be applied to diverse challenges facing cities;
3. Creating and fostering a national, and internationally-recognized, community of practice of experienced mentors; 
4. Ensuring the multidimensional career readiness of learners; 
5. Facilitating opportunities for interagency networking and intersectoral partnerships. 
Equity: By focusing on growing environmental, social, and health inequities between and within Canadian cities, BUILD takes an intersectional approach, integrating inclusion of populations excluded at societal and community levels based on intersecting race; sex, gender, and sexual orientation; religion; migration status; socioeconomic status; disability; and geographical location. BUILD prioritizes inclusion of these populations at all levels of the platform, including in leadership, team, partnership development plan for engaging partners and collaborators, approaches, design, curriculum, instructors, learners (trainees and knowledge users), and evaluation."

COVID-19 has tripled the IPV prevalence while simultaneously shutting down in-person services creating unique challenges for women experiencing violence.  Technology has been one of the few means to reach out to and support women living with IPV. 

While cisgender women in heterosexual relationships comprise the largest number of those experiencing IPV in Canada, rates of abuse for women can be higher and more complex in racialized and other marginalized communities due to intersectional structural stressors. Unfortunately, services and resources are disproportionally scarce to support these populations. 

Existing IPV app resources are predominantly in English and for use among women in heterosexual relationships. We have an opportunity to expand the availability of screening and safety planning online, to non-English speaking communities.  

The objective of this work is to culturally and linguistically adapt existing evidence-based screening (https://withwomen.ca/) and safety planning (https://withwomenpathways.ca/ and https://withwomenpromise.com/) web-apps to reflect the appropriateness of IPV apps for French and Spanish speaking communities. 

Our community partners for this initiative have identified an urgent need for our evidence-based apps to be made available to French and Spanish speaking populations with French being an official language of Canada, and Spanish also a commonly spoken language in Canada among many cultural populations.  

Our apps will be iteratively reviewed, revised and tested for acceptability by identified cultural survivors and IPV service providers. Once developed, we will employ the strategies outlined through a user guide developed by our team to assist partners in implementing these apps within their service settings."

COVID-19, physical distancing, and worries about engaging in activities outside of the home due to a highly contagious disease with a high mortality in older adults is creating social isolation and is, therefore, creating an emerging mental health crisis for older adults. A Lancet article published on March 19th 2020 described this emerging crisis and called upon the global community to use technology to help reduce social isolation in the times of COVID-19 induced physical distancing. 

In this project we are using technology to address social isolation with the aim of promoting mental health for older adults. We are creating virtual socialization hubs, which are a safe spot for older adults to create new friendships and minimize feelings of isolation using videoconferencing software. We are also creating socialization hubs for specialized groups of older adults, including those with lived experience with dementia in collaboration with the Alzheimer Society. Part of creating this safe virtual space and ensuring this intervention is accessible is training older adults how to use this technology, and we have been volunteering to successfully train older adults to use Zoom videoconferencing initially over the telephone since the onset of the pandemic. A second, and equally important virtual intervention, is telephone-based mental health monitoring, where a trained mental health practitioner will use scales monthly to monitor numerous older adults and implement mental health interventions as needed in a timely manner. The monitoring proposed in this project provides screening timely access to mental health resources, addressing the recent call by Galea (2020) for prevention and early detection of the mental health consequences of physical distancing due to COVID-19 for older adults."

Interpretation of cognitive assessment data requires some comparison standard, such as a cut-off score for screening tests, or, for neuropsychological tests, comparison of an individual's performance with that of cognitively healthy persons of the same age. Similarly, interpretation of change in cognitive performance over time requires an appropriate comparison standard, but the study of change over time is more complicated; for example, measurement error is unavoidable and is present at each assessment point. Change is assessed by comparing baseline performance versus performance on the same cognitive tests at a follow-up assessment. Reliable change methods detail whether any change was beyond expected fluctuations in cognitive performance resulting from measurement error or other factors, such as practice effects, maturation effects, and/or regression to the mean. Reliable change methods can be compared with external criteria, such as change in self-reported diagnosis, to create minimum clinically important difference scores. Our secondary objective is to create robust norms, which leverage longitudinal assessment to refine cross-sectional normative comparisons that can be used for clinical practice. Development of appropriate comparison standards for individual participant's change in cognitive performance over time will provide a powerful basis for measuring health, aging, and cognition in the CLSA. Reliable change scores for cognitive variables will be a foundation for future work for determining incident dementia at the individual participant level in the CLSA, and will serve as a methodological model for other longitudinal aging studies."

Clinical interventions aimed at reducing these behaviours have been unsuccessful. This is not surprising, as available interventions stem from what we know about substance use among non-Indigenous youth. Culture-specific interventions are needed. In order to develop these, we need to understand what leads to - moreover, protects Indigenous youth from - cigarette and alcohol use. Bringing together Indigenous and Western perspectives, this project aims to use two-eyed seeing to identify factors that protect Indigenous youth from smoking and drinking. Further, this project aims to translate the knowledge learned back to Indigenous community youth using the traditional method of storytelling. To reach these aims, we propose a five-year study that will focus on adolescents in one Northern Quebec Indigenous community. This will be a three stage project. Stage 1 will be community listening. The research team and community advisory board will come together to define culture and community context, and how these relate to youth substance use. Stage 2 will be an empirical study. In a school-based study, potential predictors of substance use will be assessed over a three-year period as adolescents transition through secondary school. This will permit the unique opportunity to track culturally- (community-) relevant protective factors of substance use as they unfold across formative years. Stage 3 will be knowledge translation. The findings will be shaped into stories of resilience, stories that are told by community members. A compilation of storytelling will be filmed, and DVDs and online version produced. These will be the property of the community and distributed through a number of platforms, such as community events and youth programs.

Evaluation of Quebec's diabetic patient's health-care trajectories in a population surveillance perspective,"[""O'Connor, Sarah""]",['N/A'],"['Diabetes', 'Diabetes-Related Complications', 'Healthcare Services', 'Healthcare Trajectories', 'Interdisciplinary Care', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Pharmacology', 'Population Surveillance', 'Primary Care', 'Secondary Prevention']",220000.0,413168,"Since 2000, the population of patients with diabetes in the province of Quebec is on the rise; almost 1 individual out of 10 was living with diabetes in 2016. Diabetes is associated with multiple complications such as lower-extremity amputations, which impose an important burden on Quebec's healthcare system. Management of diabetes and its complications requires the involvement of different healthcare specialists, which is also known as healthcare trajectories; yet, the accessibility to optimal care is not necessarily the reality for all patients with diabetes in light of their status of deprivation, location, treating physician specialities or sex. In other words, in the province of Quebec, optimal healthcare trajectories for patients with diabetes and related complications are still largely unexplored. Also, many gaps remain regarding the balance between benefices and risks of drugs used to treat diabetes. Objective: To evaluate the temporal trends of diabetes and to identify optimal healthcare trajectories in diabetes management and its complications, considering deprivation status, physician specialties, location, sex and drugs used to treat diabetes within patients newly diagnosed with diabetes in the province of Quebec. Methods: Using linked data from provincial health administrative databases, we will identify different patterns in healthcare utilization among patients with diabetes and we will study the relationship between these patterns and the incidence of complications, like lower-extremity amputations, and mortality. Relevance: This project will ensure a better understanding of the population of patients with diabetes, incidence of complications, healthcare trajectories and drugs used to treat diabetes within the Quebec's healthcare system and will propose new strategies to optimize healthcare. Ultimately, this project will allow the development of future programs/approaches that will help better prevent and treat diabetes-related complications."
Developing Ethical and Regulatory Guidelines for Research on the Human Microbiome and its Applications: Speaking to the Experts and Stakeholders,"[""O'Doherty, Kieran C"", 'Arck, Petra C']","['Burgess, Michael M', 'Hallam, Steven J']","['Development Of Regulatory Frameworks', 'Ethical', 'Human Microbiome', 'Social And Legal Implications', 'Stakeholder Analysis']",50000.0,172988,"Research on the human microbiome and its potential applications have fundamental differences to other human health research in terms of legal and ethical implications. For instance, whereas most medicinal drugs prescribed in clinical settings do not have an effect beyond the individual patient, the use of microbes in clinical settings may also have a direct physical impact on members of the patient¿s family or community. Thus, developing a deeper understanding of the human microbiome may lead to interventions that target public as well as individual health. In addition, given that human microbiota are much easier to manipulate than the human genome, the number of potential applications arising from human microbiome research may well dwarf that of research on the human genome. Given these unique circumstances, the advent of research into the human microbiome stands to benefit from a parallel effort to develop ethical guidelines to regulate such research and its applications. Social scientific research can help by informing such regulatory frameworks so that emerging technologies are applied in line with community values. This in turn will foster public trust in the research and facilitate basic and translational research on the human microbiome. Such a regulatory framework would be most effective if it were to draw on the input from experts, stakeholders, and the public. In this project, we propose to begin the process of collating and critically analysing the diversity of views and positions on human microbiome research and its applications. The project will focus on interviews with experts and stakeholders, such as scientists specializing in microbiology, genomics and related fields, disability advocates, clinicians, and public health officials. Ideally, this work would also form the foundation for a follow up project that would focus on conducting a larger engagement event with members of the public informed by principles from deliberative democracy."

In Canada and worldwide, there is increasing prevalence of chronic illnesses attributed to dysbiosis of human microbiomes. The causes for microbiome dysbiosis vary. In part, the constitution of the human microbiome depends on genetics and personal lifestyle choices, such as diet and exercise. To a large extent, however, individuals' and collective microbiomes are shaped by environmental factors including natural environments, built environments, food systems, air and other pollutants, and the microbiomes of other people and animals around us. Microbes, by their nature, are shared across humans, and between humans and the environments in which we live. Although our decisions as individuals may have some impact, it is mainly our actions as a society that shape macro-social influences such as environmental pollution, industrial food production, and guidelines for anti-biotic use, all of which profoundly affect human microbiomes. This suggests that we need a collective vision and principles to coordinate and guide societal efforts to ensure healthy microbiome environments. The concept of microbiome stewardship recognises our shared microbial environment as a common good that needs to be protected. Recent advances in understanding of environmental influences on human microbiomes now need to be utilised to develop the concept of microbiome stewardship in more detail so that it can be used to guide policy and practice. The purpose of this project is to develop a framework for microbiome stewardship, to develop guiding principles for its implementation, and to develop metrics for its assessment. We will use a series of interviews, workshops, and case studies to engage a wide range of experts and stakeholders to develop a sustainable, comprehensive, and contextual articulation of microbiome stewardship."

Unfortunately, workplace bullying and consequent sickness absence are prevalent and costly realities that significantly influence employee health. While the incidence and economic consequences of sickness absence have been frequently investigated, little attention has been directed toward the personal consequences of this experience, and virtually no attention has been directed toward understanding sickness absence in the context of workplace bullying. Workplace bullying, which is characterized by offensive, unsafe, unwanted, or intimidating behaviours; persistence and repetition; and the abuse of power or control in the workplace, presents serious and lasting negative consequences. Like workplace bullying, sickness absence may impose negative consequences and because of this, when targets of bullying require a sickness absence these consequences may be compounded. Unfortunately, we do not understand this connection. Based on the author's previous study of sickness absence among women who experienced workplace bullying, this study will examine sickness absence among men who are bullied. A qualitative grounded theory method will be used. Data will be gathered by talking with men from across New Brunswick using a semi-structured interview process. This study will contribute to the existing body of knowledge surrounding workplace health by illuminating risk factors and the pattern of sickness absence among bullied men and thus will help to direct and support preventative initiatives. Findings will inform employers and decision-makers of the nature and magnitude of this problem. Results will provide insight and widen the perspectives of health care professionals working with men who have been targets of workplace bullying and require sickness absence."

Approximately 20% of Canadians will experience mental health or substance use challenges each year. In rural communities, mental health is impacted by unique social and environmental factors. Stigma, associated with mental health, is also a concern. Confidentiality when seeking support and services for mental health in rural communities can be more challenging than in an urban centre. Rural communities in south central BC have large proportions of older adults. Older adults are a vulnerable group and mental health concerns are increasing. Mental health issues (e.g., depression) are also commonly associated with chronic disease. 

Aim/Activities: The aim of this project is to support communities by building partnerships with community stakeholders to address mental health in older adults (50 and over) in the South Okanagan. This project will conduct six consultation sessions with community organizations and community members to gather information on mental health/substance use issues, stigma, social inclusion, and current supports and services available as well as gaps. Common themes will be identified and a background document developed for a one day research planning meeting to be held in October 2015. Approximately 20 participants will be invited including researchers, decision-makers, policy-makers, community organization representatives, and community members.
 
Deliverables/Knowledge Translation: Our project is based on integrated knowledge translation (KT) activities by working directly with community stakeholders, health authority decision-makers, and policy-makers. End-of-grant KT activities will include the development of a final report, dissemination of findings through presentations, local and regional websites, and list serves. Furthermore, we will establish a South Okanagan Mental Health and Well-being Research Network and a proposal for future research in this area."

When we conduct research studies, we collect information on patient outcomes to determine the effects of one treatment versus another. Without complete and detailed descriptions of the outcomes that have been studied, nurses, doctors and other healthcare professionals cannot reliably advise on the best treatments for their patients. Our goal is to improve the completeness and quality of outcome reporting in health research studies.

An international group of experts will develop and evaluate an outcome reporting checklist. The checklist will be developed following a literature review, a survey of experts and several face-to-face meetings. Once the checklist has been developed, it will be tested in four disease areas to ensure it is useful to those designing, conducting and participating in clinical trials in respiratory distress syndrome in newborns, appendicitis in young children, anxiety and depression in adolescents and adults, and hip fracture in the elderly. Descriptions of already published outcomes will be tested against the new reporting checklist.

Our team includes world leaders in health research methodology: clinical trials, literature reviews, research reporting guidelines. We also have health care providers who treat patients and conduct research studies in the selected specialty areas. The new checklist will have a global impact by teaching researchers how to describe the outcomes they have measured so that nurses, doctors and other healthcare professionals can use this information to improve the health of their patients. This will also allow researchers to combine studies and compare the outcomes between different treatments for the same condition; such activities are needed to maximize the available evidence regarding which treatments are the most beneficial to patients, families and the healthcare system."

This study therefore aims to decrease the nosocomial transmission of TB among HCWs and patients by mapping the routes of transmission using molecular epidemiological methods and to quantify risk in order to develop comprehensive prevention measures. Genotyping will be used to examine the polymorphic marker congruence between patient and HCW TB cases.  This study will be conducted at six regional hospitals in South Africa; two in the Free State Province, two in the Western Cape and two in KwaZulu-Natal. Research tools will include a knowledge, attitudes and behaviour questionnaire to assess individual and organizational barriers to compliance with infection control practices for TB, a comprehensive facility-level infection control assessment, investigations of case-to-contact transmission among HCWs and patients, where active TB disease is the outcome of interest, and molecular epidemiological methods for all positive cases involving a HCW to document nosocomial transmission links.  Findings will inform the implementation of TB infection control measures as well as an education and training program. Consistent application of infection control principles across the healthcare spectrum is important not only in resource-strained settings such as South Africa, but in Canada as well with the emergence of pandemic influenza, SARS, and other infectious diseases.

The second café will begin to identify the linkages between the global village and the lessons that Nova Scotians need to learn and apply in our own health systems that must be identified, discussed and understood by the public.  The third café in this series will focus on the underestimated role of universities within global health.  This café will serve as a useful means for informing the public about university research and its role in global health, while also strengthening the relationship between the global health research community and the general public."

Fall prevention among older adults: Social workers role.,"['Ojembe, Blessing U']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,391406,"Background

Many healthcare professionals working together to ensure that older adult do not fall often has been successful. A social worker's role is important in this team. We checked the literature and found no research that has reported the role of a social worker in a team of healthcare professionals that lowers the number of falls among older adults. We decided to present the experiences we achieved when a social worker is an active member of those that lowers the number of falls among older adults 

Method

Social workers plan and coordinate care in a healthcare team. In trying to make sure that older people fall less or do not fall at all, we decided to look at how the older person's culture, belief and religion can help us carry out our role very well. 

What our practice revealed

We considered the culture, beliefs and values that older adults place on their relationship with their families and community members. Each older adult beliefs and values are different, for this reason, we teach older adults and their family members on what makes them to fall and how to make sure their homes are free of what will make them fall again. We also looked for the communities of these older adults, we choose and coach members of these communities on how to act during falls in their community. Thus train them to be the first person the community calls when someone falls in the community.

Conclusion

We believe that social workers' role in the team of health workers that reduces the number of falls among older adult is important. We also believe that considering the religion, belief, family and community relations of the older adults is a good way of reducing the number of falls among older adults."
Mapping the exposome to identify environmental influences on early onset inflammatory bowel disease,"['Okeme, Joseph O']",['N/A'],"[""Crohn'S Disease"", 'Endogenous Chemicals', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Exogenous Chemicals', 'Exposome', 'Fresh Air Wristbands', 'Inflammatory Bowel Disease', 'Metabolomics', 'Ulcerative Colitis']",140000.0,436285,"Background

Inflammatory bowel disease affects more people in Canada than other countries. In recent year, an  increase in cases has occurred among young children of age 0-4. The disease is progressive and can be better managed when it is diagnosed early. We do not know exactly what causes IBD but research suggest that environmental stressors can trigger IBD in people who have the IBD genes. To evaluate risk factors and prevent IBD, we need new techniques to help us measure potentially important environmental exposures and efficiently detect IBD early.

Goal

This project aims to identify exposures from outside (external) and inside the body (internal) that are associated with IBD. Our study will use new scientific tools and techniques to measure these exposures. The objectives of the study are to:

1.Measure external exposure and internal exposures and their association with IBD 
2.Analyze how these exposures can trigger metabolic changes in individuals with IBD

In this study, we will recruit two groups of children between ages 0-18 from IBD cohorts in Toronto, Boston and Munich: 270 who have been diagnosed with IBD and 135 who have not. Following participant consent, the children will wear Fresh Air Wristband Sampler for 3 consecutive days that will absorb chemicals from the environment and provide one stool sample. We will test the wristband in our lab for chemicals they absorbed and biomarkers of interest and analyze the results using computer models. We will compare results of those that have and those that do not have IBD. 

Expected outcome

Many Canadian have and will have IBD and it is important to understand how prevent or manage IBD better. This project brings together experts in environmental science, IBD specialists and public health to study how factors that we can change affect IBD. The result of this study will help us better understand factors beyond our genes that affect IBD and how we can modify these factors to prevent and treat IBD."
Smoking on the Margins: An Equity Analysis of the Outcomes of an Outdoor Smoke-free Policy,"['Okoli, Chizimuzo T', 'Pederson, Ann P']","['Bottorff, Joan L', 'Greaves, Lorraine J', 'Hemsing, Natalie J', 'Poole, Nancy']","['Health Equity', 'Health Policy', 'Health Promotion', 'Mixed Methods', 'Sex- And Gender-Based Analysis', 'Smoke-Free Policies']",44047.0,219341,"Policies that restrict where people can smoke have been shown to improve population health by reducing exposure to second-hand smoke and these policies enjoy a high level of support from the public, health professionals and policy makers. Following local, national and international examples, Vancouver's Board of Parks and Recreation approved a smoke-free by-law for the city's parks, beaches, and facilities effective September 1, 2010. Research suggests that such smoke-free by-laws, when enacted indoors, may affect men and women in different ways, but little research has examined the effects of such outdoor smoking bans on women and men and other segments of the population. Such by-laws may have different effects because some people may not have the means to seek out alternative places to smoke, have access to resources to quit smoking, or have other sites for recreation. In partnership with the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation and other community organizations, we will assess the impact of the new smoke-free by-law in Vancouver on men and women, smokers and non-smokers, and compare our findings to those in three other cities in British Columbia who are either establishing their own ban or have decided not to have an outdoor smoking ban. This study will collect information on how the ban was introduced in Vancouver, how it is enforced, and what the response to the ban has been from several groups of people, including current smokers, and women and men who use the parks and beaches. Our aim is to help other communities that are thinking of introducing an outdoor smoking ban in parks or beaches to develop a ban that is effective but feasible. In particular, we aim to help designers of outdoor smoking restrictions develop a balanced approach that reduces second-hand smoke exposure, supports people who wish to quit smoking, and does not lead to counterproductive stigmatization or marginalization of current smokers."
Improved Tuberculosis Prevention and Treatment Through Accurate Identification of Intrahost Diversity,"['Olawoye, Idowu B']",['N/A'],"['Bioinformatics', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Public Health', 'Tuberculosis']",135000.0,473579,"Each year, there are an estimated 10 million new tuberculosis (TB) infections and 1.3 million deaths globally. In Canada, TB incidence is relatively low compared to other parts of the world. However, TB remains a public health crisis in some Canadian-born populations-notably those that are indigenous, underhoused, or incarcerated. While TB is treatable, drug resistance is a significant challenge to TB care and prevention, making treatment more difficult and lengthy and, in many cases, with poorer outcomes.  
With whole genome sequencing (WGS)-a technology that reads an organism's genetic code-came an improved understanding of TB transmission and drug resistance. WGS can identify changes (mutations) in the TB genome that are passed along during the person-to-person spread of TB. These mutations, in combination with epidemiological information, help public health to identify transmission chains and potentially intervene to prevent further spread. Similarly, mutations responsible for TB drug resistance have been identified by WGS and can predict which antibiotics may not be effective for an individual's infection. However, much of the research to-date assumes a homogenous TB population-a single genetically identical TB infection. Yet we know that within-host genetic diversity exists and is largely disregarded because of the lack of bioinformatic tools to correctly differentiate between sequencing background noise and true mutations related to bacterial subpopulations. Ignoring within-host diversity can lead to inaccurate linkages between cases and undetected drug resistance.
To develop the bioinformatics tools necessary to more fully understand within-host diversity as it relates to transmission analyses and drug resistance detection, this research will use more than 4,000 TB genome sequences and associated epidemiological information collected by Canadian public health labs. This work is expected to provide new insights to support improved TB prevention and treatment."
Injection initiation assistance as harm reduction during a fentanyl-driven overdose crisis: Injection drug users' experiences and implications for structural interventions,"['Olding, Michelle']",['N/A'],"['Hiv/Aids', 'Ics Travel Awards', 'Injection Drug Use']",2500.0,400348,"Despite the proliferation of fentanyl in North America, the impact of this drug market change on injection initiation processes has not been examined. An understanding of the dynamic between drug supply and injection initiation norms will help inform interventions to prevent injection initiation, which are imperative for preventing HIV. We explore how people who inject drugs (PWID) in Vancouver, BC, understand and navigate social norms of initiating others into injecting within the context of an opioid overdose crisis. In-depth interviews were conducted with 19 PWID who reported helping someone inject for the first time. Participants expressed moral dilemmas about assisting others with injecting. While participants described a 'moral code' prohibiting assisting injection-naïve individuals, this code was not the sole consideration shaping social action around injection initiation. Rather, PWID made decisions about whether and how to assist novice injectors with consideration for social norms around 'inter-personal responsibility'. Some PWID were reluctant to assist novice injectors due to uncertainties around drug potency and concerns about being criminally liable for the overdose deaths of those who they assisted. However, PWID also sought to protect novice injectors from harms associated with an increasingly potent drug supply by providing them with injection assistance, education, and supervision. Assisting novice injectors was seen as a form of harm reduction to prevent novice injectors from using alone or engaging in riskier injection practices.  Our findings suggest that efforts to prevent injection drug use must be balanced with ensuring novice injectors have access to safer injecting environments. Structural interventions reducing the vulnerability of novice injectors should be prioritized, including the implementation of supervised injection sites allowing for assisted injection, Good Samaritan laws, and policy changes conducive to safer drug supply."
"Optimizing delivery of supervised drug consumption services: Implications of socio-structural environments, service design, and operating practices","['Olding, Michelle']",['N/A'],"['Community-Based Research', 'Ethnographic Methods', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health Service Research', 'Overdose Prevention', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Supervised Drug Consumption Services']",105000.0,406754,"Canada is in the midst of a growing overdose crisis which accounted for at least 3,996 deaths in 2017. Overdose deaths have been particularly devastating in British Columbia (BC), where approximately four people die each day from overdose. The crisis highlights the urgent need for life-saving overdose prevention interventions, including the expansion of supervised drug consumption services where people may use illicit drugs in the presence of health care professionals and other staff trained to intervene during an overdose. Diverse new models of supervised drug consumption services are being rapidly scaled-up across the province, including peer-run 'overdose prevention sites,' in-hospital sites, mobile vans, and services integrated within existing community health centers. The diversity of supervised drug consumption models currently being implemented in BC represents an unprecedented opportunity to examine how supervised consumption services may be designed and delivered across contexts to maximize their reach and public health benefit. As services are implemented in new settings, research is also urgently required to examine how features of the social and structural environment-including drug laws, regulatory environments, policing practices, and local drug use culture-influence the implementation and impact of supervised consumption services. This study addresses this gap by using ethnographic approaches to examine how emerging models of supervised drug consumption services (e.g. peer-run, in-hospital, mobile) interact with social and structural features of the implementation context to shape the social practices of people who use drugs and their onward risk of overdose. Findings from this study will contribute to the overdose response by identifying policy and programmatic changes to optimize the reach and public health benefits of supervised drug consumption services."

These meetings will be inclusive of multidisciplinary perspectives and diverse lived/living experiences. The focus will be on building capacity to identify areas of intersectionality between the impact of poverty, mental health challenges, and substance use on aging. Interactive and scenario based large and small group discussion will take place. Key talking points and ideas will be captured during each meeting and thematic analysis will be applied. The resulting key themes will be synthesized and presented to participants for the purpose of identifying research priorities, the primary objective of this planning grant. 

Partnership development is a key objective of this planning grant, as it lays the foundation for conducting research specific to the needs of individuals who are aging on the fringes. Overall, this CIHR Institute of Aging planning and dissemination grant, led by an Early Career Researcher in the field of aging, will be used to identify equity-informed research priorities, advance knowledge, and build capacity to plan, implement, and engage in rigorous and robust research that is inclusive and considerate of individuals who are aging on the fringes."

Newcomer Womens' Perceptions of Exclusive Breastfeeding,"['Olson, Tonia N']",['N/A'],"['Breastfeeding In Newcomers To Canada', 'Infant Feeding', 'Newcomer Health']",17500.0,202665,"Health professionals have long been aware of the benefits of human milk to ensure that infants get adequate nutrition, and emotional nurturing. It is also widely accepted that breastfeeding infants for the first six months of life can reduce the risk of a variety of childhood illness such as diabetes, stomach infections, and ear infections, and even sudden infant death syndrome. Yet, despite World Health Organization and pediatricians' recommendations that breastfeeding is best for babies, barriers still exist that prevent mothers from breastfeeding up to the recommended six months, or breastfeeding at all.

The purpose of this study is to explore how women who are newly immigrated to Canada feel about breastfeeding their children. Participants in the study will be recruited through Saskatoon programs that support vulnerable new mothers and newcomers. The goal will be to assess the types of support that newcomers feel they require to breastfeed their babies to six months. The need for this research is twofold. First, as immigration to Canada is increasing, so too is the call for health professionals and governments to be informed and sensitive of cultural considerations related to health care delivery. Second, the results of this research will provide the groundwork for future education and social support networks, so that newcomers may be supported to live healthy lives.

Health problems of infants and children related to a lack of not breastfeeding and/or short breastfeeding duration are well documented, as is the cost to the Canadian health care system resulting from such illness. As such, the work of providing culturally sensitive breastfeeding support must not be underestimated; even though, like so many other services provided by preventative health care, the benefits may be difficult to measure. To explore how newcomer women feel about breastfeeding will provide valuable information for the delivery of preventative health care services."
"A systematic review of adoption, implementation and impact of daily physical activity policies in Canadian schools","['Olstad, Dana Lee']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2500.0,324186,"Purpose: Many children do not do enough physical activity, increasing their risk of poor health and weight gain. Physical education courses at school provide children with some activity, but this is not enough. Some Canadian provinces have daily physical activity (DPA) policies with rules about the amount of time children must be active each day. The purpose of this study was to determine if these policies are being used, and how effective they have been.  
Methods: We searched scientific databases, reference lists, and websites from research centers for studies that had investigated adoption (how policies were developed), implementation (were policies used) or impact (were policies effective) of Canadian DPA policies. Articles were included if they were original research studies published in scientific journals in English or French, and if they studied adoption, implementation or impact of DPA policies in Canadian schools. Of the 917 articles found, 29 were relevant and were read in full by 2 independent reviewers. Thirteen articles met all inclusion criteria and were included in the final review. 
Results: One study assessed adoption of DPA policies. Eight papers evaluated whether schools implemented DPA policies, most often through surveys. Results showed that some aspects of DPA policies were implemented, and others were not. Nine papers studied the impact of DPA policies on children's physical activity levels and body weights using step counters and surveys. These studies suggested that Canadian DPA policies have had little to no impact on children's physical activity levels and body weights. We could not make firm conclusions because of the small number of studies and differences among them.  
Conclusions: This study suggests that Canadian DPA policies have not been fully implemented and have had little to no impact on children's physical activity levels and body weights. These results can help create more effective physical activity policies for children."

The Policy Cycle Stages will be the overarching framework used to address our research questions.  In the first phase we will administer a survey to all school boards in Alberta.  Having identified early-adopter schools through the survey, we will use a multiple case study design to understand how the guidelines function in different school environments.  In the second phase we will study only junior high schools who have established nutrition policies.  The purpose of this assessment will be to determine which processes were effective/ineffective in developing school nutrition policies, to identify barriers, to describe the perceptions and attitudes of students, parents, teachers, and school administrators toward the nutrition policies, and to measure consequent changes in dietary behaviours, dietary intake, body mass index, and nutrition knowledge.  Qualitative and quantitative outcomes will be assessed through interviews, in-school observation, physical measurements (height, weight), and completion of a web-based nutrition survey. This research will provide the first robust assessment of impact and effectiveness of school nutrition guidelines and policies in Canada, and will inform further development of effective nutrition policies in Canadian schools."

Because nutrition and health are linked, poor diet quality may partly explain why disadvantaged people have higher risk of cancer and risk factors for cancer like obesity. Socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are diverse, however, and some subgroups, such as certain racial/ethnic groups, may be more vulnerable to cancer than others. It may be helpful to identify the most vulnerable groups so we can match them with interventions that address their unique cancer risks. This study will examine whether diet quality partly explains the link between socioeconomic position and cancer and obesity, its importance for specific vulnerable groups, and locations where these groups consume unhealthy items like sugar sweetened drinks and discretionary foods (high calorie foods with few nutrients). We will do this by using data from 14,000 adults who participated in the 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey Nutrition. Participants provided information about the foods they ate in the last 24 hours, where they ate them, and about their health behaviours and conditions. We will use path analysis to study if the relationship between socioeconomic position and cancer and obesity is partly explained by people's diet quality and other health behaviours. These analyses will be done in larger and smaller subgroups so we can see if diet quality is more important for some groups. Linear regression will show where these groups consumed the most sugar sweetened drinks and discretionary foods. Results from this study will show whether poor diet quality can partly explain why disadvantaged groups have higher rates of cancer and obesity, which groups are the most vulnerable, and where they eat unhealthy foods. This information will help to match vulnerable Canadians with targeted interventions to improve their diets and reduce their risk of cancer."

The BC Farmers' Market Nutrition Coupon Program gives low-income seniors and young families 16 weeks of coupons worth $15/week to buy healthy foods in farmers' markets and teaches them about healthy eating. It is not clear if the program is meeting its goals of improving the diets, well-being and health of low-income adults because its impacts have not been studied.  This research will study the impact of the BC Farmers' Market Nutrition Coupon Program on what people eat, and their social and mental well-being.  It will also try to understand how the program makes these changes and how the program can be improved.  We will use a strong study design that can show cause and effect.  We will study these things by asking 200 adults who are in the program, and 200 adults who are not in the program, to tell us about the foods they eat, their social relationships, stress levels and general mental well-being.  All of these questions will be asked before the program starts, right after it ends, and 16 weeks after it has ended so that we can understand how these things changed during and after the program. A smaller group of 40 adults will be interviewed about their experiences in the program to help us understand how any changes happened, and how the program can be improved.  The BC Farmers' Market Nutrition Coupon Program is paid for by taxpayers and so it is important to find out if it is actually helping to improve people's diets and well-being.  Information from this study will help the BC government and the BC Association of Farmers' Markets to understand if the program is meeting its goals, how it is doing so, and how the program can be improved.  This information can also be used by governments in other provinces and countries to decide if they should start their own farmers' market nutrition coupon programs."

My research program aims to inform development and implementation of policies, both inside and outside the health sector, to improve dietary behaviours, body weight, and health, particularly among disadvantaged groups.  
 
My research program is structured into three complementary streams:
 
1)   The first stream of my research seeks to understand the policy process, and the factors that facilitate or impede uptake and impact of health promoting policies.  
2)    The second stream of my work investigates the impact of policies on food environments, dietary behaviours, body weight and health.  I am particularly interested in examining the impact of policy on socioeconomic inequities in obesity and obesity-related behaviours. 
3)    The third stream of my work focusses on dietary patterns, and their association with health and disease, particularly among disadvantaged groups.  
 
I use qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods (i.e. qualitative and quantitative methods within the same study) in my research.

Protecting children from unhealthy food and brand marketing in the digital age: A novel artificial intelligence system to assess food and brand marketing on digital media,"['Olstad, Dana Lee', 'Lee, Joon']","['Elliott, Charlene D', 'Prowse, Rachel', 'Yu, Yaoliang']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Children', 'Data Science', 'Marketing', 'Nutrition', 'Policy', 'Unhealthy Food']",100000.0,405131,"Background: Unhealthy food/brand marketing has a negative impact on what children eat and on their health. Canada will soon ban marketing unhealthy foods/brands to children <13 years old on television, the internet and other media. However, very little is known about the amount and types of unhealthy food/brand ads that children see online and the government does not have a way to monitor whether companies are obeying the new law. The problem is that public health has fallen behind technologically. Marketers are using artificial intelligence (AI), but public health is still relying on humans to try to find out what marketers are doing. Goals: We will develop and test the first AI system that can assess the amounts and types of food/brand marketing that is online. We will use the system to assess differences in the amount and type of food/brand marketing that is online from before to after Canada's new marketing ban comes into effect. We will also study whether companies are obeying the new law. Methods: We will use AI to identify food/brand marketing on Canadian websites, gaming applications and YouTube videos. AI will also be used to: 1) rate the healthfulness of the foods/brands that are being marketed; 2) assess the types of marketing strategies that are being used; and 3) determine whether marketing targets children. AI and marketing experts will test our system to make sure it is accurate. We will conduct statistical testing to understand how the amount and type of marketing changes from 12 months before to 12 months after Canada's marketing ban is implemented, and whether companies are obeying the new law. Significance: This AI system will provide the first scientific evidence about the amount and type of unhealthy food/brand marketing that Canadian children may see online. It will also provide a way to study whether companies are obeying the Canadian government's marketing ban. This information can help to understand how to improve child nutrition and health."

Health Canada is going to ban digital marketing of unhealthy food that appeals to children <13 years. However, it is not clear which types of marketing should be banned and it will be hard to know if companies are obeying the new law. To address these problems, we are developing an artificial intelligence (AI) system that can identify digital marketing of unhealthy food. Right now, the system can only identify a few marketing strategies that companies use to target children. Our system needs to be expanded so it can identify all of the ways that marketers try to appeal to children. Goals: This research will expand our AI system by training it to 'think like a child' and know which digital marketing of unhealthy food appeals to children. We will then use the new AI system to study how this marketing affects what children eat. Methods: Children (6-12 years; n=2,600) will tell us which marketing appeals to them. This information will be used to train our AI system to 'think like a child.' We will also check that the system is accurate and not biased against some groups of children, such as ethnic minority groups. Next, we will use the AI system to do a randomized controlled trial in Calgary, Toronto and Montreal. In this trial, 678 children will be randomized to see digital marketing of unhealthy food that does (n=226) or does not (n=226) appeal to children, or to non-food marketing (n=226). We will measure how this marketing affects children's intake of snacks, their diet quality, and their awareness of, and attitudes towards marketed foods. Expected results: This research will develop the first AI system that can identify digital marketing of unhealthy food that appeals to children from their own perspective. It will also help us to understand how policies can better protect children from the negative impacts of unhealthy food marketing."

This is called household food insecurity. The BC Farmers' Market Nutrition Coupon Program (FMNCP) is trying to reduce household food insecurity and improve people's diets by giving low-income households $27/week to buy healthy foods in farmers' markets for 16 weeks. In a previous study, we found that the FMNCP reduced household food insecurity, but it did not improve the diet quality of adults. We think this is because parents, most of whom were mothers, used the money to buy food for their children and not for themselves. The FMNCP may need to give households more money to buy enough food for parents and their children. Goals: We will do a randomized controlled trial to study the impact of three higher healthy food subsidies, compared to the usual FMNCP subsidy, on the diet quality, food insecurity and other health-related outcomes of 288 parent-child pairs. Methods: 288 low-income households will be randomized to a group that gets the usual FMNCP subsidy of $27/household/week, or to a group that gets a subsidy that is two ($54/household/week), three ($81/household/week) or four times higher ($108/household/week) for 16 weeks. Participants can also attend weekly food skills education. We will collect information from one parent (18-64 years) and one child (6-12 years) in each household about what they eat, their food insecurity, and other health-related outcomes. This information will be collected at baseline (0 weeks), right after the intervention ends (16 weeks) and 16 weeks after the intervention ends (32 weeks). We will also calculate whether the subsidies are cost-effective. Significance: This will be the first study to examine how different doses of a healthy food subsidy affects what parents (especially mothers) and their children eat. It will help governments to understand how much money low-income households need to buy enough healthy food for parents and children."

They may also live in areas with larger income gaps between the rich and the poor which can cause stress and increase their risk of poor health. As a result, people with a lower SEP may age faster biologically than people with a higher SEP. Epigenetic clocks can be used to estimate the difference between people's chronological age and their biological age to see if their bodies are aging more quickly than expected. By understanding how people's SEP affects their speed of biological aging, we can develop policies to slow aging and improve health. The purpose of this study is to understand how SEP is associated with the speed of biological aging among middle-aged and older adults in Canada and the US. To do this research we will use data from 1,445 adults who participated in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (45-85 years) in 2012-2015, and data from 4,018 adults who participated in the US Health and Retirement Study (50+ years) in 2016. We will use statistical models to understand if four different measures of adults' SEP (annual household income, education, household food insecurity, income inequality in the area where they live) are associated with four different epigenetic clocks that measure the speed of biological aging. We will also study if these links differ by sex, gender and life stage, and between Canada and the US. Information from this study will help us to understand how adults' SEP affects the speed at which they age biologically and what we can do to promote healthy aging in lower SEP groups. By comparing results from Canada and the US, we will also understand if the social, economic and political contexts in different countries affects the speed of biological aging. This information can be used to design policies to promote healthy aging in a more equitable way."
Access to health services and supports for Black preterm infants in Alberta: A longitudinal case study,"['Olukotun, Mary']",['N/A'],"['Healthcare Access', 'Infant And Child Health', 'Preterm Infants', 'Qualitative Research', 'Racial Disparities']",105000.0,475660,"Though the national rate of preterm births has remained relatively stable over the past decade, Alberta's rate has steadily increased, with the province now reporting the second highest rate across Canada. Black mothers account for majority of preterm births in North America and as a result, Black infants make up the highest proportion of preterm infants in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). Curiously, Black infants have similar to moderately better outcomes in the NICU when compared to infants of the same gestational age, however, they experience poorer health outcomes such as higher mortality rates once discharged into the community, especially in their first year of life. This shift in outcomes is a concerning phenomenon which disproportionately affects Black preterm infants and is associated with poorer availability and accessibility of resources in the community setting. There is little research exploring the health of Black preterm infants as it relates to health service access in Canada; in Alberta, the data is nearly non-existent. My proposed study will address this significant knowledge gap in the existing literature. Study findings will shed light on access challenges in the care of Black preterm infants after discharge from the NICU and will guide the development of strategies to support their short- and long-term health outcomes in the community setting."

Postpartum depression (PPD) is a devastating state occurring between 4-6 six weeks following childbirth and is a major depressive disorder. Symptoms are anxiety, mood fluctuations, insomnia, fatigue, appetite changes, agitation or slowed movements, decreased concentration ability, feelings of guilt or worthlessness and suicidal ideations. PPD may be the most common complication of pregnancy. It is a most serious illness which can have long lasting traumatic effects on women and their families. Fortunately, PPD is treatable. This would point to the importance and value for early detection and treatment of the problem. Yet, immigrant women may be at risk for lack of early detection and treatment of this illness. An important factor in the duration of postpartum depression is the extent of delay to appropriate treatment. Little research has been done in Canada focusing specifically on the mental health needs and issues of refugee and immigrant women after childbirth. Intervention strategies continue to be underdeveloped and more research is essential. This study will investigate the experiences of immigrant and refugee women diagnosed with PPD. Thirty immigrant and refugee women living in Calgary, Alberta will be interviewed. The knowledge gained from this study will contribute to the development of healthcare services that are effective and culturally appropriate to address PPD amongst immigrant and refugee women in Alberta."
Canadian Aboriginal Tradition Medicinal Plants Used for the Treatment of Diabetes,"['Omri, Nadia']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal', 'Canada', 'Ethnopharmacology', 'Natural Products', 'Systematic Review', 'Tradionnal Medicine', 'Type 2 Diabetes']",2500.0,320975,"Diabetes mellitus type 2 is a significant heath issue for the Canadian indigenous population, as they are predisposed to this chronic disease. The use of herbal medicine as complementary therapy in this cohort of patients allows health professionals to bridge the gap between the cultural and therapeutic needs of their patients. However, the majority of health care professionals do not have adequate knowledge to safely prescribe or recommend herbal products. The aim of this research was to identify Canadian medicinal plants used by the indigenous population that may have an impact on diabetes related complications. We used the updated method of Whittemore and Knafl (2005) and identified 14 natural products with antidiabetic properties. The pharmacokinetics and toxicology of these plants were confirmed according to published retrospective studies. We found that the two natural products, Populus balsamifera  and Vaccinium vitis-idaea , are unlikely to counteract with commonly used western medicine and their therapeutic properties. The bark of Populus balsamifera  increased energy expenditure, reduced appetite, and decreased glycaemia and insulin resistance. This agent also exhibits anti-obesity properties as it reduces body weight, the grade of steatosis, and the accumulation of retroperitoneal fat and triglycerides levels. The fruit of Vaccinium vitis-idaea  is also an excellent complementary treatment as it reduces disease-related complications and promotes weight loss. This fruit agent reduces LDL, inhibits advanced glycation end products, lowers the total cholesterol level, and decreases the grade of steatosis. In conclusion, this retrospective review will enable health professionals to better understand the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of traditional indigenous medicine and their potential use along with conventional drugs for better management of diabetes mellitus type 2."

Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), can help public health researchers answer more complex questions more quickly, resulting in better health for Canadians. However, use of AI to process very large amounts of information about individuals can also create ethical problems, such as risks to privacy, or generation of findings that negatively impact some groups or communities. Although there has been much attention to identifying ethical issues associated with the use of AI, there has been much less progress in developing practical solutions to address these issues. A critical step in moving toward solutions is sorting out which ethical issues are truly unique to AI, and which are variations of issues that have been addressed by existing mechanisms. The planning activities proposed here aim to systematically examine the ethical issues posed by public health research using AI, to identify the unique issues that are not currently addressed.  We will bring together stakeholders with expertise in ethics, health equity, Indigenous research, public health research and AI to examine these ethics issues and identify review processes to assess and manage them."

Many children with language delay are not identified until they begin formal schooling. The Language Use Inventory (LUI) is a new  20-minute questionnaire standardized on over 3500 Canadian children that a speech-language pathologist, physician or health professional can have a parent complete who is concerned about their child's language development. The LUI is intended for children 18 to 47 months old. The child's score can be quickly converted, using the norms developed, into a percentile score that tells the parent and the professional where the child is at compared to children of the same age in months (e.g., 35th percentile), similar to height and weight charts. The LUI thus provides to the parent and professional an empirically-based, well-validated and large-scale standardized outcome score that can aid in making a more informed decision with respect to seeking further speech-language or developmental assessment. No similar standardized instrument exists to assess early language use. Two studies are proposed that aim to broaden the implementation and usability of the LUI. The goal of Study 1 is to develop a version of the LUI appropriate for French-Canadian children given the recognized lack of language assessment measures available in French. Study 2 aims to via a longitudinal study, the growth of pragmatic language ability among children from 2 to 3 years of age (i.e., growth curves) in order to better understand trajectories (i.e., paths) that represent normal variation and those that should be regarded as clinically significant. This study will also allow us to better understand factors contributing to individual differences in the early growth of pragmatic language ability."

The needs of Two-Spirit and Indigenous LGBTQ+ people were identified as distinct priorities to be addressed by Friendship Centre communities province-wide. There is a growing recognition within the Friendship Centre movement of the gaps in service and support for 2SLGBTQ+ community members, who must learn to accept health services and programs that do not recognize their Two-Spirit identity and its relevance to their health. The purpose of this project is to create identity-affirming and community-building spaces for urban 2SLGBTQ+ young people. The OFIFC will create opportunities for innovation in urban communities by bringing together 2SLGBTQ+ community members, Knowledge Holders, Elders, as well as local stakeholders for two regional gatherings (north and south). The gatherings will provide opportunities for intergenerational transmission of cultural knowledge of gender, sexuality, and Two-Spirit identities. There is an existing vibrant network of relationships of Two-Spirit and Indigenous LGBTQ+ youth within urban Indigenous Friendship Centre communities. The gatherings will be driven by the momentum of their leadership and facilitate the co-creation of localized vision and implementation plans for community-driven research projects aimed to improve Two-Spirit and Indigenous LGBTQ+ self-defined wellness."

It is well understood that healthy eating, including avoiding foods higher in sodium, sugars, and saturated fat and eating plenty of vegetables and fruits, helps mitigate the risk of chronic disease. Promoting food literacy is an essential strategy to support healthy eating behaviours and food preferences, especially in children and youth. To bring attention to the need to support children and youth in becoming food literate, the Nutrition Connections team at the Ontario Public Health Association (OPHA) has been examining the state of food literacy in Ontario. The OPHA has undertaken several projects in recent years to identify the key players, policies, and programs that make up the food literacy landscape in Ontario. Although there are many groups and individuals involved in activities that support children and youth to become food literate across the province, a facilitated connection among these players is lacking and this has created gaps in food literacy research, policy, and programming. We are proposing to host a two-day workshop in June 2020 in Toronto, Ontario to bring together key players to discuss, identify, and reach consensus on priorities for food literacy research, policy, and programming. The workshop will include presentations by invited food literacy and child health experts across sectors (e.g., researchers, policy makers, and practitioners). Break-out sessions with guided discussions and activities to encourage networking, knowledge sharing, problem solving, and priority setting will make up the majority of the workshop. To date, there have been limited opportunities for experts, researchers, practitioners, government, and funders to convene and discuss priorities related to food literacy research, policy, and programming. The proposed workshop will create such an opportunity and is expected to ignite ongoing relationships and collaborations."

The Indian Solution to the Policy Problem: Developing an Indigenous Policy Model to Address First Nations Health and Education Disparities,"['Opikokew Wajuntah, Cassandra J']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal Peoples', 'Comparative Policy Analysis', 'Critical Discourse Analysis', 'Education', 'Health', 'Indigenous Research Methodology', 'Policy', 'Politics', 'Post-Colonialism', 'Social Determinants Of Health']",108000.0,272854,"Prior to contact with settlers, Indigenous peoples had laws and cultural practices that governed their societies and promoted community cohesion. Although it is often overlooked, these laws and practices could also be referred to as policies created by each community's leadership. Post-contact, the locus of control for policy-making amongst Indigenous communities shifted from internal decision-making powers to becoming externalized and located within the power of the Canadian governments through the processes of colonization and assimilation. Under the auspices of assimilation, the ultimate agenda of the government at the time was ""the eradication of Indigenous population by eradicating Indigenous differences, and public policy became the weapon of choice"" to deal with the ""Indian problem"" (Episkenew 2009, 26). As a result of this policy history and the policy-making process, both the health gap and education gap (a key social determinant of health) between First Nations and non-First Nations Canadians is widening despite numerous policies designed to improve their health and education levels. These policies are often failing to achieve their desired outcomes due to three key factors: lack of community control/input; racist and oppressive policy structures and institutions; and an ineffective policy-making process that does not take into account traditional Indigenous policy-making procedures or principles. Therefore, it is the formation of policy, and the resulting policy as an instrument itself, that limits their effectiveness in addressing the health and education needs of First Nations people. As a result, the policy-making process needs to be re-examined so that an Indigenous policy framework can be created to help guide the formation of health and education policies that improve First Nations health and education outcomes in Canada through culturally appropriate and lasting methods."
DIGHR Workshop on Artificial Intelligence Approaches for Water Safety and Public Health Protection,"['Orbinski, James J']",['N/A'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Population Health', 'Safe Water', 'Waterborne Disease']",14950.0,378434,"Diarrheal diseases were responsible for more than 1.3 million deaths, including 400,000 among children less than five years of age, globally in 2015. This burden is primarily borne by the marginalized poor in the global South-in neglected rural areas, in urban slums, and in refugee and internally displaced persons (IDP) camps. Other emerging and re-emerging waterborne threats such as hepatitis E and cholera likewise present the threat of potentially catastrophic outbreaks for these populations. In these contexts, safe, treated water that has been chlorinated is essential for protecting public health and preventing potentially catastrophic outbreaks. Water quality-chlorine in particular-is therefore an important factor in understanding the levels of waterborne diseases affecting populations around the world. Artificial intelligence (AI) approaches could help us to better understand the relationship between water quality and waterborne diseases among different populations in the global south, including in urban slums and in refugee/IDP camps. More importantly, AI approaches could potentially be used to develop tools that help us to predict when waterborne diseases outbreaks might occur, simply by looking at widely available water quality data. Predictive tools like this could help public health practitioners globally develop early warning systems for waterborne disease outbreaks such that preventative measures can be taken to limit their extent or prevent them altogether."
Using an agent-based model to simulate long-term mental health and labour market outcomes associated with Post-Covid Conditions among the Canadian working population.,"['Orchard, Christa G']",['N/A'],"['Agent-Based Modeling', 'Employment', 'Evidence Synthesis', 'Forecasting', 'Mental Health', 'Post Covid-19 Condition', 'Sars-Cov-2', 'Systematic Review', ""Worker'S Health""]",35000.0,484591,"Most individuals who are infected with COVID-19 recover quickly, however for 1 in 6, symptoms including fatigue, shortness of breath and 'brain fog' can develop or persist for 3 months or longer after their initial infection. This condition is commonly referred to as long COVID and is estimated to have affected around 1.4 million Canadians. For those who experience long COVID, the effects can be debilitating, impacting ability to work, which can lead to long periods of absence, need for work accommodations or even job loss. Those with long COVID also commonly experience symptoms of poor mental health including anxiety and depression, which can be an additional cause or a consequence of inability to work. As a result, long COVID can have important social and economic impacts on the publicly-funded mental healthcare system and the Canadian workforce. This project aims to estimate the long-term impact of long COVID on employment and mental health outcomes to inform healthcare and economic policy and planning. 

Since the evidence on long COVID is rapidly emerging, the first step of this project is to collect and summarize evidence regarding the impact of long COVID on mental health and employment. The second step of this project is to use a simulation approach to predict the long-term impacts of long COVID on population-level mental health (eg cases of depression and anxiety, access to publicly funded mental health services, cost of mental healthcare), and employment (eg days of work lost and unemployment) outcomes 5 years from now. Finally, we will use this simulation technique to estimate the change in mental health and employment outcomes in the presence of specific interventions that are designed to promote recovery among those with long COVID.  The findings of this project will help us to quantify the impact of long COVID and potentially identify effective interventions to lessen this impact, which will help inform healthcare and economic planning in Canada."

Often struggling with poverty, criminalization, and discrimination they experience rates of violence, mental health issues, and premature death that far exceed those of other Canadians. Medical and epidemiological research with sex workers often explores health and risk-related behaviours through the lens of individual behaviour, without fully considering how the socio-cultural and environmental context impacts health risks and protective factors like resilience among these vulnerable populations. New approaches that examine how structural factors and daily life conditions impact the health risks and resilience among these vulnerable populations are needed. Such investigations are especially important for sex workers in smaller cities because they are fewer in number than similar populations in large centres and there are fewer resources allocated to support their health needs in smaller cities, making them ""hidden"" populations that are difficult to reach. This research will generate knowledge about the socio-cultural and environmental factors that influence health risks and resilience among women and transgender sex workers in the tri-city area of Kitchener-Waterloo-Cambridge (KWC), Ontario. Interviews and social mapping exercises, which document the patterns of physical and social activity within different environments, will be conducted with twenty women and five to 10 transgender sex workers in each site (n=75-90). We will also analyze media and policy documents pertaining to sex work. The findings from this research will inform the design of locally relevant gender-specific service and policy initiatives to address the impact of socio-cultural and environmental influences on the health of women and transgender street-based sex workers in KWC and other small-medium sized Canadian cities."

We suspect people with high levels of social support will demonstrate better cognitive performance than people with low levels of social support. We believe people with more depressive symptoms will show poorer cognitive performance than people with less depressive symptoms. If so, then our results will justify policies to encourage the development of social support and mental health resources in Canada."

As humans are social beings, social isolation may worsen mental health conditions, lower quality of life and access to health services, and lead to adverse health outcomes. Poor cognitive function reduces independence and quality of life, and increases the chances of developing dementia, being institutionalized, or dying. 

Scientists believe social isolation can lead to poor cognitive function. However, the links between social isolation and cognitive function are not well understood. To understand these complex links, we will use data collected from more than 27,000 Canadians aged 45 to 85 years. These data include social, psychological, demographic, and health information collected at two points in time, spread three years apart. The collection of these data is made possible through a large investment from the federal government. Using this investment, we will conduct research to: 1) understand the impact of social isolation on cognitive function; and 2) identify vulnerable subgroups who may benefit the most from future interventions to address social isolation and thereby improve cognitive function. 

Our research fits into the domain of ""social determinants of health"" because we study social factors that positively or negatively affect healthy aging. Our specific focus is on social isolation and cognitive function. Social isolation is comprised of many elements such as a lack of social networks. Cognition is also multifaceted and will be examined for overall cognitive impairment, and within specific domains critical to healthy aging (memory and executive function). The data are rich and support this extensive investigation of social isolation and cognitive function, providing key evidence for social interventions to improve the health of middle-aged and older Canadians."

More than half with untreated BD abuse alcohol and/or drugs and 60% will have marriages that end in divorce. Suicide by those with BD is greater than unipolar depression. Although (almost) everyone experiences mood variability, people with BD experience profound shifts in mood (e.g., clinical depression, mild elation [hypomania] or extreme elation or irritability). It is estimated that there are today 75,000 Canadians 50+ years of age with BD; moreover, the number of older Canadians with BD will triple over the next 10 years. Despite these growing numbers, psychosocial research focussing on older adults with BD is virtually nonexistent. This proposed 5-year study will include intensive periods of data collection; these 2-week periods will each separated by 8-months. Participants will be prompted at 2-times per day (12 hour window) to report current mood, medication adherence and recent life events. We envision use of a GPS located electronically connected to an iPad or similar tablet-type device. The GPS information (recorded every 20 seconds) will allow us to determine if periods of mania are heralded by expanding geographic range, rapid movement between points or, novelty seeking; conversely, contraction of movements may be a precursor to major depression episodes.  Two-hundred and five participants will be recruited from both urban and rural communities with a 10+ year BD diagnosis; medical information will be obtained during regular psychiatric assessments. We will use a range of contemporary research methods with emphasis on BD in later life (e.g., retirement, bereavement, concurrent physical illness). This study will provide a wealth of information to increase our understanding of BD in older adults where little information currently exists."
"Early life-influences on suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and suicide mortality: a life-course perspective to inform prevention","['Orri, Massimiliano']",['N/A'],"['Explanatory Mechanisms', 'Life-Course Epidemiology', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Mediation Models', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Suicidal Behaviours', 'Suicide Prevention']",135000.0,362121,"Suicide and suicidal behaviours (suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) are among the leading public health concerns, especially among youths (second cause of death in Canada). Most prevention programs aim to identify and help individuals made vulnerable to suicide by a difficult time in their lives (unemployment, relationship problems). However, contemporary research is showing that early-life influences, such as events occurring before or around birth and family characteristics (birth order, parental age, family size, birth weight, birth length), can influence later susceptibility to suicide. For instance, the fourth-born child is 200% more at risk to commit suicide in adulthood than the first-born child. This project is interested in these early factors, and the way to prevent their later effect on suicidality. The objectives are: (1) to review and summarise the current literature on this topic; (2) to study the association between early-life influences and suicidal behaviours in 3 large cohorts: the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development, including 2120 children, followed from 5 months to 17 years; the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youths, including 16903 children, followed from 1 to 25 years; the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Kindergarten Children, including 3018 children, followed from 6 to 29 years; (3) to determine why early-life influences convey a higher risk of suicide. Indeed, it is possible that this risk is not due to these factors per se, but to other intermediate factors. Our hypothesis is that early-life influences have an effect on some intermediate factors, which in turn increase the susceptibility to suicide. Especially, we will examine the role of 3 potential intermediate factors: parenting practice, parental stimulation/attention toward the child, and mental health problems in adolescence. Knowing the intermediate factors linking early-life influences and suicidal behaviours will highlight new avenues for prevention."
"Examining the contribution of birth weight to mental health, cognitive, and socioeconomic outcomes: A two-sample Mendelian randomization","['Orri, Massimiliano']",['N/A'],"['Birth Weight', 'Causality', 'Mendelian Randomization', 'Mental Health', 'Suicide']",1000.0,411927,"Previous research reported an association between birth weight (a marker of fetal growth) and adverse mental health and socioeconomic outcomes. However, it is difficult to establish whether this association are causal, as associations between birth weight and adult outcomes can be better explained by a common factor (for example, maternal use of alcohol in pregnancy) that may cause a change in both birth weight and outcomes (confounding factor). To establish causality, the better research design would be a randomized trial. However, it is impossible and unethical to directly randomize birth weight. Therefore, to probe the causal role of birth weight, the most robust evidence would come from quasi-experimental design. In this study we used a quasi-experimental design called Mendelian randomization, which uses genetic variants robustly associated with birth weight as proxy of birth weight. Genetic variants are attributed randomly at birth and are not influenced by confounding factors (eg, maternal alcohol use cannot change the offspring genetic makeup), thus they are particularly suited to be used as proxy variables. Using dataset from international consortia who performed large scale genome-wide association studies, we found that we found evidence for a causal contribution of birth weight on attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and suicide attempt, as well as for socioeconomic outcomes, ie, educational attainment, income, and social deprivation. However, no evidence was found for a contribution of birth weight on the other mental health outcomes (including depression, autism, bipolar disorder) and for intelligence. Our findings support a causal role of birth weight in the pathway leading to ADHD, PTSD, and suicide attempt as well as socioeconomic outcomes, suggesting that early interventions targeting birth weight may therefore have a positive impact on promoting mental health and improving socioeconomic outcomes."

Our first objective is to clarify the associations, if any, between cannabis use and later anxiety, depression, and suicidality, and whether they are causal or simply associative. Our second objective is to test the genetics-environment link - whether youth with pre-existing vulnerability to mental health problems are more at risk of depression, anxiety, and suicidality if they use cannabis, while the risk remains low for others. Our third aim is to clarify whether associations vary by sex and gender. We will use data from 5 existing population-based longitudinal cohorts from Canada, UK, and USA (combined sample size 20,000 youth, including 4000 siblings). Participants had been asked at various times whether, how often, and when they started using, as well as questions on their mental health. Data will be analyzed by robust approaches to provide strong evidence in support (or not) of the links between cannabis use and later depression, anxiety, and suicidality. Clinically relevant patterns of cannabis use will be examined: a) ever used, b) age at onset, and c) intensity.

While HIV is now considered to be a chronic, manageable illness, among gbMSM, HIV care can often be impeded by HIV-related traumas, mental health, substance use, addictions issues, and other intersectional factors. Recently, sexualized drug use (or ""chemsex"") with crystal methamphetamine has re-emerged as a topic of concern in health and nursing research due to increasing rates among gbMSM living with HIV. Not only can crystal methamphetamine cause neurologic damage (e.g., changes in mood, cognition, and thoughts), it can also act as a catalyst for negative health outcomes while living with HIV, such as decreased immune function, exacerbation of underlying mental health conditions, and long-term substance dependency and addictions issues. Presently, little is known about the sub-culture of gbMSM living with HIV, mental health, substance use, and addictions issues who are engaging in chemsex. As a result, nurses and other clinicians can only provide ""patch-work"" solutions to manage care for this group. 

The focus of this doctoral research will to undertake a qualitative research study to understand (1) the sub-cultural norms of gbMSM living with HIV, mental health, substance use, and addictions issues engaging in sexualized drug use and (2) how group values affect health and risk-taking practices. This research could yield promising findings in health and nursing research to help support the development of prevention interventions for gbMSM living with HIV who are engaging in sexualized drug use. Indeed, in the absence of concrete solutions on how to support this sub-group of gbMSM, it is extremely possible that their health and social outcomes will continue to decline, and that this already vulnerable group will become increasingly isolated."

While it has sustained significant legal, scholarly and activist attention, there has been considerably less interest in how ethical issues are transforming the field of HIV/AIDS advocacy. In this project, we explore how the ethically uncertain and emotionally charged nature of the issue of HIV/AIDS non-disclosure is transforming the ethical field of HIV/AIDS. What obligations do HIV-positive people have to their sexual partners? What constitutes a significant risk for HIV infection? Courts have struggled to answer these questions in a clear, consistent, and direct manner, with some cases finding that condom use reduced the risk of transmission to an insignificant level while others found that it did not. AIDS service organizations advocate that the risk of transmission varies with the gender of the parties and with sexual position and activity, which complicates the court's desire to craft a uniform legal duty to disclose."

There are not many studies on Métis health and particularly about Métis children's health. Most research on this area groups the experiences of Métis, First Nations, and Inuit children together. The first decade of life is an important period for the influences of key genetic, biological and socioenvironmental factors It is important to understand the ways in which factors that affect the health and well-being of Métis mothers influence the healthy development of Métis children. 

Lii Zaanfaan means ""the children"" in Michif, the traditional language of the Métis. From a Métis perspective, the health of children is deeply linked to the health of their families, communities, and the land. This perspective is supportive of broader knowledge on social determinants of health and childhood development. This research results from a long-standing collaboration between the Métis Nation of Alberta and academic partners to develop community relevant knowledge to inform Métis-specific health initiatives. The project has three objectives: 1) evaluate health and well-being trajectories of Métis children during the first 10 years of life and the influences of maternal and social factors on these outcomes; 2) explore perspectives of Métis children and their families on social, environment and cultural factors that influence well-being and healthy development of children, and 3) identify community-led, culturally meaningful Métis initiatives to promote Métis children's health and well-being through cultural healing and self-determination. We will use a variety of quantitative and qualitative research methods that are culturally acceptable within a Métis context."

Beluga meat and maktak were identified as important sources of mercury and organic contaminants in the modern Inuit diet, but also contribute important nutritional and cultural benefits to consumers. The proposed study is a collaborative project that will address health risks and benefits for country food consumption in Inuvik, Tuktoyaktuk and Paulatuk, NT, CA. This study will address data gaps in the ISR by creating an updated database for nutrients and contaminants in country foods; identifying dietary sources of contaminants and nutrients for adults and children; and, to assess benefits and risks of consumption of country foods. The hypothesis is that country foods continue to provide significant benefits to the Inuvialuit; however, culturally appropriate dietary guidelines are needed to reduce methylmercury exposure associated with the consumption of beluga meat. The consumption of country foods and market foods will be characterized using food frequency questionnaires and contaminant and nutrient concentrations in country foods will be analyzed. Concentrations of methylmercury, organic contaminants and emerging contaminants of concern will be measured in blood samples to identify individuals with exposure above health-based guidance values. Methylmercury in hair will used as an alternate to estimate exposure to methylmercury. Foods in the diet that contribute to contaminant exposure will be reviewed by the community research team to address how contaminant exposure could be reduced without adversely impacting the cultural and nutritional importance of these foods."

Milligan Mine). Specifically, the research team was asked to: 1) Help identify  occupational and community health impacts associated with the construction and operation of the Mt. Milligan mine, and: 2) Develop a framework that is based on these findings and additional research that once implemented, can be used to maximize health benefits and mitigate additional health impacts for these communities. It is also the goal that this framework be applicable to any Aboriginal community or municipality in Canada associated with mineral development. 

This study builds upon a community-based health research pilot project funded by the Vancouver Foundation. This project has identified significant health needs and health service gaps present in the study communities. The pilot study has also identified that these communities are particularly at risk of mining-induced health impacts, especially as it relates to cultural determinants of health for Aboriginal Peoples. 

The proposed study focuses on the collection of qualitative and quantitative community-level health and social/traditional determinants of health data and involves the sharing of both academic and traditional knowledge as it relates to mining and community health. A substantial portion of this project is focused on building health research capacity within the study communities with community research coordinators and graduate student trainees identified. Sharing of research knowledge throughout the project with an extensive list of BC mining and health associated stakeholders will seek to improve the current health impact assessment procedures for mineral development and the allocation of health services in mining regions."

Second, using data from a large Canadian cohort study we will determine if specific combinations of lifestyle behaviours (obesity, physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and diet) are associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer among this age group. Third, to support clinical decisions for guiding screening in this population, we will determine if biomarkers and clinical factors can identify patients at high risk of developing colorectal cancer. Finally, we will estimate the potential impact of changing screening practices (reducing the age of initiation) on the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer among this population.
