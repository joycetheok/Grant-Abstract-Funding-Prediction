From prison to community: removing barriers to care for formerly incarcerated persons with HIV,"['Antoniou, Tony', 'Dicenso, Anne Marie', 'Strike, Carol J']","['Challacombe, Laurel A', 'Smith-Merrill, Diane', 'Bayoumi, Ahmed M', 'Kendall, Claire', 'Loutfy, Mona R', 'Wobeser, Wendy L']","['Access To Care', 'Community-Based Research', 'Health Equity', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Prisoners', 'Public Health']",32850.0,314160,"Research has shown that people with HIV who are released from prison have difficulty connecting with health and social support services as they return to their communities.  Consequently, these individuals are at risk of poor health outcomes following prison release including stopping life-saving anti-HIV treatments, complications of HIV infection, and relapse of substance use. In addition, with poor linkage to HIV care and social support, formerly incarcerated persons with HIV rely on hospital emergency departments for their care.  Therefore, it is important that interventions be developed which promote access to these services for when these individuals are returning to the community.  Such interventions are more likely to be effective when informed by the experiences of formerly incarcerated persons living with HIV.  However, to date, no such studies have been conducted in Canada.  Working in partnership with the Prisoners With HIV/AIDS Support Action Network (PASAN) and other AIDS Service Organizations across Ontario, the goals of this project are to: 1) establish a research team of community members, knowledge users and researchers to conduct community- based research intended to optimize health outcomes of formerly incarcerated persons with HIV; 2) identify barriers to post-release linkage to HIV health and support services from the perspective of formerly incarcerated persons with HIV from across Ontario; and 3) host a knowledge translation and exchange seminar to discuss findings with participants, knowledge users and policy makers . This capacity-building study is part of a larger strategy to engage community members in identifying barriers to post-release linkage with HIV health and social support services (Phase I - current proposal), select, implement and pilot interventions to address barriers (Phase II), and evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions for facilitating post-release linkage with HIV health and social support services (Phase III)."
Involving heterosexual men living with the human immunodeficiency virus in developing a research and policy agenda for their community,"['Antoniou, Tony']","['Glazier, Richard H', 'Loutfy, Mona R', ""O'Brien, Kelly K"", 'Strike, Carol J']","['Community-Based Research', 'Health Policy', 'Hiv', ""Men'S Health""]",24450.0,246309,"Although heterosexual men living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are increasing in number, there has been a lack of engagement with this community by HIV researchers and policy makers.  Consequently, these men remain continuously underrepresented in many decision-making processes and community-based research activities.   The main purpose of this project is to assemble a research collaborative of heterosexual men living with HIV, policy makers, representatives from AIDS service organizations (ASOs) and academic researchers in order to develop a research and policy agenda that is specific to the needs of this demographic.  A community advisory board (CAB) of five heterosexual men living with HIV has been involved in preliminary planning, and will be involved in the data generation, thematic analysis and presentation of findings from the summit to stakeholders and academics.  In this manner, the CAB and summit participants will adopt multiple roles in the pyramid of involvement outlined in the Greater Involvement of Persons Living with HIV/AIDS statement, including 'experts', 'speakers' and 'decision-makers'.  Therefore, the planning and execution of the meeting is notable for its significant degree of input by members of the target community, and represents a commitment on the part of the research team to build further research capacity in partnership with this group.  To our knowledge, our work with heterosexual men living with HIV represents the first concerted attempt to build research capacity with this group.  The contribution made by our proposal is therefore novel and will produce community-generated information that is highly relevant for decision makers, community workers and clinicians working with HIV-infected heterosexual men living with HIV."
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children and youth,"['Antoniou, Tony', 'Pajer, Kathleen', 'Gomes, Tara']","['Lunsky, Yona J', 'Penner, Melanie', 'Gardner, William', 'Gozdyra, Peter', 'Juurlink, David N', 'Mamdani, Muhammad', 'Tadrous, Mina']","['Children And Youth', 'Covid-19', 'Mental Health']",149844.0,450562,"Emergency measures aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 have unsettled all aspects of the lives of Canadian children and youth. In Ontario, home to close to 40% of Canadian children and youth, school closures and stay-at-home orders have produced prolonged periods of social and physical isolation from classmates and extended family. Simultaneous disruptions in the availability of extracurricular activities and access to health care and specialized support services further increased the isolating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, predisposing children and youth to worsening mental health. However, there is limited research describing the impact of COVID-19-related public health measures on the mental health of children and youth. This is especially important for disadvantaged children and youth for whom the harmful effects of emergency measures may be worsened by pre-existing disadvantage, such as lack of internet access for remote learning or medical appointments, poverty, and living in neighbourhoods without parks or green space. Our goal is to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions (e.g., lockdowns, school closures) on the mental health of children and youth in Ontario. We will specifically study hospital admissions and emergency department visits for mental health conditions, emergency department visits for self-harm, and prescriptions for psychotropics (i.e., antidepressants, benzodiazepines, stimulants and antipsychotics). For each of these outcomes, we will study how their occurrence changed with COVID-19, whether there were differences according to the neighbourhood of residence, and the relationship with the duration of lockdowns and school closures. We will also study whether there were differences between females and males, by age group, between children and youth with and without mental health or neurodevelopmental conditions before the pandemic, and according to features of the neighbourhoods of residence."

The proposed project is an analysis of environmental and reproductive health in British Columbia, Yukon, and Alberta. The reproductive endpoints shown to reflect an exposure-disease relationship include low birth weight, premature births, small-for-gestational age, stillbirths and infant death. Low birth weight and small-for-gestational age are major determinants of morbidity and mortality among newborn infants, and are risk factors for behavioural and chronic disabilities later in life. The production of small-area disease risk maps are useful for monitoring and surveillance purposes by defining a baseline spatial disease pattern that can be reassessed over time. 

The methods employed for this project will incorporate spatial statistical techniques and epidemiological methods with the aid of geographical information systems (GIS). Statistical models will be used to produce reliable risk estimates of the specific birth outcomes at the community level. We have produced preliminary data utilizing birth data obtained from the BC Perinatal Health Program and environmental contaminant data from the National Pollutant Release Inventory and other national and provincial sources. The perinatal data include birth outcome and numerous maternal and antenatal risk factor data for all singleton births in BC from 2001 - 2006.

The goal is to produce a robust model capable of analyzing birth outcomes particularly attuned for remote and Aboriginal populations where the risk of environmental exposures is high. Ultimately, community health risk maps will serve to facilitate the formulation of health policy decisions with respect to the allocation of funding and resources to minimize environmental risk."
Investigating the contextual and behavioural determinants of sodium intake among adult Canadians,"['Arcand, JoAnne']","['Ahmed, Mavra', 'Franco Arellano, Beatriz', 'Kirkpatrick, Sharon', ""L'Abbe, Mary R"", 'Lou, Wen-Yi W', 'Pasha, Mahmooda K']","['Behaviour Theory', 'Diet', 'Education', 'Mixed Methods', 'Nutrition', 'Social Marketing', 'Sodium', 'Survey']",623476.0,451629,"Canadians consume large amounts of sodium, which increases their risk for heart disease and stroke. Strategies that support Canadians in following a lower sodium diet, like Canada's Food Guide, follow the idea that behaviour change can be achieved by increasing knowledge, alone. Yet, knowledge is only one part of behaviour change, which has shown minimal impact on sodium reduction to date. Therefore, it is important to understand the many internal and external factors related to sodium intake among Canadians to better inform sodium reduction strategies.

Most research on factors that impact Canadians' sodium intake is old (>10 years). It is unknown if these factors have changed over time, with the adoption of Canada's Sodium Reduction Strategy in 2010. Importantly, the research that has been conducted in Canada has been limited. The surveys administered in the past mostly focused on informing policies for sodium, and it did not study how and why people behave the way they do, and what some of the barriers and motivators are to following a lower sodium diet. 

Our team will conduct research to deepen our understanding of what factors impact a person's sodium intake and food choices. We will develop a survey capturing the contextual (e.g., health literacy) and behavioural (e.g., perceived risks of sodium, attitudes towards sodium, intention to reduce sodium) factors related to sodium intake. The survey will be administered to 3380 Canadian adults, who will also complete diet recalls so that we can estimate how much sodium they eat. This data will allow us to 1) monitor changes in key factors of sodium intake over a 10-year time frame, 2) assess the behavioural and contextual factors impacting sodium intake among Canadian adults, and 3) determine whether these factors are associated with lower sodium intakes. 

This research will be the first of its kind. It will help us develop better strategies to support people in reducing their sodium intake."
"Efficacy of a digital school-based nutrition education intervention to improve healthy eating knowledge, attitudes and behaviours","['Arcand, JoAnne']","['Farkouh, Michael E', 'Franco Arellano, Beatriz', 'Hughes, Janette M', 'Kapralos, Bill', 'LeSage, Ann C', 'Lou, Wen-Yi W', 'Vogel, Ellen']","['Children And Youth', 'Food Literacy', 'Mobile Health', 'Nutrition Education', 'Nutrition Knowledge, Attitudes And Behaviours', 'School-Based Health Promotion', 'Serious Games', 'Technology']",481950.0,467719,"Healthy eating has lifelong benefits for children, as it positively impacts growth and prevents the development of disease. One way to help promote healthier diets is through nutrition education, which is part of school curriculum across Canada.

However, most nutrition-focused serious games do not contain credible information and are not suitable for classrooms. Our research team (teachers, game developers, nutritionists) developed Foodbot Factory, a mobile serious game to teach elementary school children about healthy eating. In our earlier research, children found Foodbot Factory to be highly engaging, easy and fun to use. Also, children who played Foodbot Factory for one week had significant improvements in their nutrition knowledge. Now, we would like to understand if Foodbot Factory can improve healthy eating knowledge, attitudes and food intake in Grade 4 and 5 school children. We will recruit 28 classrooms across Ontario. Classrooms will be randomized (like the flip of a coin) to one of two groups: 1) to learn with Foodbot Factory in nutrition education lesson plans, or 2) to learn with non-technology based activities (worksheets, teacher instruction, videos) in nutrition education lesson plans. Each classroom will have 5 daily nutrition lessons in a 1-week period. In both study groups we will measure nutrition knowledge and attitudes using a questionnaire (like a test) and we will measure food intake using a screener. These measurements will be taken before the study, after the 1 week of nutrition education lessons, and then 4 weeks and 4 months after the lessons are completed. The results will help us understand if Foodbot Factory should be rolled-out across Canada to support nutrition education."

"Translating research into a videogame to disseminate knowledge about cannabis, psychosis, and early intervention","['Archie, Suzanne']","['Dennison, Jill', 'Kennedy, Sue', 'Boydell, Katherine M', 'Cheng, Chiachen', 'Kidd, Sean A', 'Mcdermid Vaz, Stephanie', 'Mckenzie, Kwame J']","['Cannabis Use', 'First Episode Psychosis', 'Qualitative Study']",25000.0,289549,"In order for society to benefit from the latest scientific research on a preventable risk factor, it is generally accepted that individuals who could benefit the most should be made aware. However, when the relevant research pertains to youth, researchers will need to use more innovative methods than scientific reports to get their attention. Although it may not be necessary or sufficient, recent research suggests that marijuana use three times a week for three months or longer during the teenage years is a significant risk factor for the development of psychosis among vulnerable youth. We propose to raise awareness of this little known risk factor. 
This project translates and disseminates this research knowledge about marijuana use, psychosis, and early intervention by using a youth friendly medium - an animated video game/app. As a communication strategy, interactive gaming technology has the potential to be more appealing and accessible to youth than mainstream educational activities. The game will be designed by game developers, who will work collaboratively with the co-applicants to better appreciate the research findings and to integrate the knowledge into the game. The inspiration will come from stories that emerge out of two qualitative studies containing descriptions of real life and first-time experiences with marijuana use, psychosis, and the healthcare system. The game will then be disseminated at a forum for youth and youth leaders in order to foster an action plan to market the game online to youth, particularly those who are weekly marijuana users. The game/app will have the potential to disseminate this research knowledge, possibly increasing awareness of this modifiable risk factor for psychosis and reducing the risk of psychosis among vulnerable youth."
"Insights about Cannabis and Psychosis: How do young people with early psychosis conceptualize the link between cannabis and psychosis, particularly those from Black racialized backgrounds?","['Archie, Suzanne', 'Langill, Gordon']","['Serravalle, Michael', 'Anderson, Kelly K', 'Ayonrinde, Oyedeji', 'Baines, Alexandra S', 'Bardell, Andrea', 'Cheng, Chiachen', 'Ferrari, Manuela', 'Grant, Christina N', 'Johnson, Natasha I', 'Kozloff, Nicole', 'Olagunju, Andrew T', 'Palaniyappan, Lena K', 'Sadeh, Elham']","['Black Racialized Groups', 'Concurrent Disorders', 'First Episode Psychosis', 'Knowledge Translation Products', 'Qualitative Analysis', 'Video Games']",,441569,"Regular cannabis use is widely recognized as a significant risk factor for relapse of psychosis among young people experiencing a first episode of psychosis. Therapies that improve cannabis use disorder better than standard treatment do not exist. Furthermore, few studies examine what young people with early-phase psychosis from Black racialized communities understand about this relationship - even though they may be the ones most at risk. Innovative strategies that raise awareness of this relationship could represent a significant contribution to solving these problems. This project will be carried out with the Free For All Foundation, serving Black racialized communities.

Objectives: This project will evaluate the use of new video games - The Back to Reality Video Game SERIES (SERIES), featuring a Black youth as the hero, with emerging psychosis who uses cannabis. To this end, this project explores what young people with early-phase psychosis/cannabis use disorder understand about the impact of cannabis on their psychosis experiences before and after playing the SERIES. 

Methods: Participants will meet criteria for a first episode of a psychotic disorder and a cannabis use disorder. Participants will be Black African (24 people), Black Caribbean (24) descent {English speaking], or any ethnicity French-speaking (10). We will invite them to tell us their stories about their psychosis and cannabis experiences before playing the SERIES. After playing either the SERIES or a control game, a quiz will measure their knowledge about the relationship between cannabis and psychosis. 

Impact: The voices of young people from racialized communities will generate new knowledge about the meaning of race, cannabis use and psychosis to inform use of a new KT product. It will deal with gaps in knowledge about cannabis use for people experiencing early-phase psychosis from Black communities, possibly leading to new strategies to improve cannabis use disorder in this population."

"HIV and Socio-Structural Predictors of Initiating Crystal Methamphetamine Injection among Sex Workers in Vancouver, Canada","['Argento, Elena']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2500.0,347115,"Crystal methamphetamine has become one of the most commonly used illicit drugs worldwide, with significant potential for addiction and transmission of HIV and other blood-borne infections. Despite the wide range of social and health-related harms associated with injection drug use, risk factors for injecting crystal methamphetamine remain understudied and poorly understood. This study therefore aimed to investigate risk factors for initiating crystal methamphetamine injection among women sex workers in Vancouver, Canada. Sex workers were invited to participate through outreach to outdoor locations and hidden indoor and online venues across Metro Vancouver and completed bi-annual interviewer-administered questionnaires and HIV/STI (sexually transmitted infection) testing by a project nurse between 2010 and 2013. This study used Cox regression analyses to identify predictors of initiating crystal methamphetamine injection over three years follow-up. The following risk factors were found to be significantly associated with first time injection of crystal methamphetamine among sex workers: injection heroin use, occupational violence, being HIV positive, and a history of childhood abuse. The study findings underscore the urgent need for integrated violence and HIV prevention efforts in mitigating the risk for initiating injection drug use and for novel, evidence-based addictions treatment tailored specifically for sex workers."
Investigating the socio-structural context and impact of new Canadian legislation and criminal policies (C-36) on HIV/STI risks among sex workers and their clients,"['Argento, Elena']",['N/A'],"['Criminalization', 'Drug Use', 'Hiv Prevention', 'Sex Workers', 'Structural Violence']",108000.0,338166,"In Canada and globally, sex workers continue to experience high rates of HIV/STI (sexually transmitted infection), violence, and poor access to health care services. Despite the significance of socio-structural factors (e.g., laws, stigma, social support) in influencing the HIV epidemic, large research gaps remain in our understanding of how these factors affect HIV/STI risks for sex workers. For the first time in Canadian history, new sex work legislation (C-36, implemented December 2014), criminalizes purchasing (clients) and advertising the sale of sexual services, while the selling of sex remains legal. These policies have been adopted in Canada despite the lack of evidence supporting this legal framework and an absence of research on health impacts and HIV/STI risks for sex workers. The aim of the proposed study is to investigate the impact of new sex work laws and enforcement-based policies on HIV/STI risks (e.g., drug use patterns, violence, condom use, access to care) among sex workers and clients in Vancouver, Canada. This project will draw on empirical survey data gathered from a larger longitudinal cohort study of women sex workers in Vancouver and will employ advanced social epidemiological modelling techniques to make use of the longitudinal data before and after the legal reforms. This work will be complimented by in-depth interviews with sex workers and clients recruited through a paired cohort study of men who purchase and sell sex. Given the high HIV/STI burden among sex workers and lack of research on the health impacts of criminalization of sex work in Canada and globally, there is a critical need to translate the findings into health policy and practice. Knowledge translation of the research findings to local community and international partners will help to inform ongoing developments in public health policies to reduce the risks for HIV, as well as provide evidence for upcoming Charter challenges."
Preventing Sexually Transmitted and Blood Borne Infections (STBBIs) among Sex Workers: A Review of the Evidence on Determinants and Interventions in High-Income Countries,"['Argento, Elena']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2500.0,368209,"Objective: Sex workers continue to face a disproportionate burden of HIV and other sexually transmitted and blood borne infections (STBBIs). This review aims to provide a comprehensive synthesis of global research on determinants of STBBIs and promising intervention practices for sex workers of all genders in high-income countries. 

Methods: We searched for publications over the last decade (January 2005-March 2016) among women, men, and trans sex workers. Data obtained from quantitative peer-reviewed studies were triangulated with publicly available reports and qualitative/ethnographic research where quantitative evidence was limited. 

Results: Research consistently demonstrates the direct and indirect impacts of structural factors (e.g., violence, stigma, criminalization) on increasing STBBI risk for sex workers, further compounded by individual and interpersonal factors (e.g., substance use, unprotected sex). Sub-optimal access to health and prevention services remains concerning. Full decriminalization of sex work has been shown to have the largest potential to avert new infections in sex work, through reducing workplace violence and increasing access to safer workspaces. 

Conclusions: The high burden of STBBIs among sex workers across high-income settings is of major concern. Multi-pronged structural and community-led approaches are paramount to addressing STBBI risk and are necessary to realizing health and human rights for sex workers."
Waning Measles Immunity in Ontario: A Population-Based Cohort Study,"['Ariyarajah, Archchun']",['N/A'],"['Antibody Testing', 'Health Administrative Data', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Measles', 'Population-Level Immunity']",105000.0,439330,"Immunity derived from the measles vaccine has been shown to decrease over time in countries where measles has been eliminated. This phenomenon is called waning immunity. Canada eliminated measles in 1998 and with increasing measles cases reported globally, waning immunity puts Canada at risk for future outbreaks. Although children are recommended to be vaccinated at 12 months of age, vaccination at older age has been associated with higher long-term immunity. This has been shown in Canada through studies resulting from measles outbreaks, albeit with small sample sizes. We aim to use a large population-based cohort study to examine the effect of age at and time since first dose of measles vaccine on measles immunity using antibody test results from Public Health Ontario (PHO) linked to health administrative data from 2010 to 2019. Results from this study may inform changes to the measles vaccine schedule to optimize measles immunity and ensure that future generations maintain measles elimination status."
"Sexual risk behaviour and substance use among bisexual men who have sex with men in Vancouver, Canada: A longitudinal cohort analysis","['Armstrong, Heather L']",['N/A'],"[""Bisexual Men'S Health"", 'Determinants Of Health', 'Epidemiology And Public Health', 'Hiv', 'Longitudinal Research', 'Respondent Driven Sampling', 'Sexual Health', 'Sexual Risk Behaviour', 'Sexually Transmitted Infections', 'Substance Use']",90000.0,361561,"When compared with heterosexual and gay men, bisexual men often experience worse health outcomes including more substance use, higher sexual risk behaviour, and poorer mental health. In spite of this, almost all studies looking at sexual risk and substance use over time group gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men together, regardless of their sexual orientation. This is problematic because bisexual men have different health needs and face different challenges because of their sexual orientation. This study aims to examine patterns of sexual risk, substance use, and associated characteristics (for example: age, income, mental health, and social support) over the course of four years in a large sample of bisexual men in Vancouver, BC. Additionally, we seek to determine the population-estimates and prevalence of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections in this population. Finally, we will compare sexual risk, substance use, and associated characteristics among bisexual men in Vancouver to a similar sample of exclusively gay men to identify meaningful differences to inform treatment and prevention programs. This research is important because bisexual men are often over looked in ""gay men's health research"" - a catch-all phrase used to describe research among all men who have sex with men. As a result, we do not fully understand the needs of this community. Working in partnership with members of the community and community-based organizations, we will use the results of this study to increase awareness and acceptance of bisexual men within the LGBT community, inform policy and prevention activities, and increase outreach to bisexual individuals. This work will increase the scientific understanding of bisexual men's health needs and will enable service providers and health care specialists to better serve the needs of this marginalized population in BC and across Canada."

The aims are 1) to reveal the effect of dementia and increasing longevity on care use, 2) to explore the possibilities of people with and without dementia to live at home with the help from informal caregivers and formal homecare, and 3) to explore the effect of changes in different health and social care systems on the use of care. 
The study starts from retrospective investigation of the association of dementia and age at the time of death with health and social care use. The time period studied represents the time during which longevity has increased and long-term care coverage decreased in several countries. I will use Finnish and Swedish national health and social care registers. Next, focus is on how the changes in cognitive ability affect care use and satisfaction with life in the course of ageing, and on the interdependency between them. For this part, I will use data from LASA (the Netherlands) and explore my options to use CLSA data in collaboration with researchers from the University of British Columbia. A six-month visit to UBC in the spring of 2019 is part of this collaboration. Third, an in-depth investigation focus on how people with cognitive problems and/or dementia and their informal caregivers describe their experiences on the adequacy of care and support they receive in the community. I will use longitudinal interview data, collected in Finland in 2018-2020. The study will offer novel information for ageing research and health and social care policymakers.
The Project started in 2018 and is funded by the Academy of Finland until July 2021. The project is conducted as part of the studies in Centre of Excellence in Research on Ageing and Care (2018-2025) (CoEAgeCare)."

Through sharing knowledge and ideas, we will create guidelines that prioritize equity, fairness, and transparency in AI development and use. Ultimately, our goal is to apply the knowledge gained to develop a larger-scale project.
The project will involve literature reviews, stakeholder engagement, expert workshops, leading to the development of a policy brief and a framework for integrating EDI principles into AI technologies in healthcare. 
The expected outcomes of this project include improved understanding of EDI integration in AI interventions, interdisciplinary collaboration, policy brief development, a framework for EDI integration in AI healthcare, capacity building and mentorship, and international visibility and partnership opportunities. 
The project has a structured 1-year timeline, and the planning and feasibility logistics are already in place to ensure a smooth implementation of the project activities. The team possesses the required expertise, and they have established partnerships with key stakeholders and organizations that will contribute their knowledge and expertise to the project. Overall, this project aims to promote the development of AI technologies that prioritize equity, diversity, and inclusion, ultimately advancing healthcare and health equity for all."

Emergent pollutants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) are of concerns for their potential risks to human health. They are used as brominated flame-retardant (BFR) additives in the manufacture of household items (eg TV sets, toys...). Recently, data showed that PBDE levels in breast milk of North American women are doubling every 5 years. In addition, PBDE levels in pregnant women's plasma are 20 to 106 fold higher than those of Swedish women. HBCDs and TBBA levels have never been monitored in Canadian women. 

Foetal brain is more susceptible to toxic exposure due to blood-brain barrier immaturity. In rodents, low doses exposure to BFR during development leads to hyperactivity and neurobehavioral impairments. In addition, foetus is usually exposed to a mixture of pollutants. When mixed, even at low doses, these substances can have additive adverse effects. Animal studies showed that PBDE, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and mercury, all present in cord blood, can interact to enhance neurobehavioral defects.  In spite of these observations, there are still no data on combined effect of BFR and other pollutants on neurodevelopment. 
  
I propose to conduct a follow up study which is the first who addresses exposure to PBDE, TBPPA and HBCDs in relation to psychomotor skills and behaviour in childhood. Pre- and post-natal BFR exposure as well as interaction between BFR and known neurotoxic pollutants will be studied. This study is a part of an ongoing study including 800 pregnant women and their babies. We now are processing with the 2-year old follow up. A complete biobank and a database are available to test my hypothesis. The biobank will be used to analyse BFR levels which will be correlated to neurobehaviour skills at 2 and 4 years old."

BC organizations that promote health, provide health services, and partipate in health policy production have expressed interest in applying the knowledge from such a framework for action. Their interest stems from recognition of unique challenges senior gay men face in creating and belonging to such networks, and no other undertaking in BC at present to bolster social support network options for senior gay men. The proposed Framework for Action is essential in BC to senior gay men's increased access to and belonging in social support networks, their experiencing the health benefits that result from belonging to such networks, and their improved maintenance of functional autonomy and reduced reliance on formal BC healthcare services."
Dried-Blood Spot HIV and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Testing Uptake in Community-Based Bio-Behavioural Research,"['Ablona, Aidan']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1490.0,400478,"Dried-blood spot (DBS) sampling is a way of easily collecting blood samples that can be carried out by any trained individual, with no professional designation required. DBS samples can be tested for the presence of HIV and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV), thereby giving an estimate of the level of each virus that is present in the population that is sampled. Knowing the burden of these viruses can help identify priorities for prevention and treatment programs and for areas of research. DBS sampling hasn't been used widely in HIV or HCV testing settings, so this research project evaluates what the impact of DBS was in a community-based Canadian health survey survey of gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM) called Sex Now 2018. GBMSM were recruited at 16 LGBTQ Pride festivals across Canada from June to September 2018. Participants had the option to provide DBS samples for HIV/HCV testing and could opt-in to receiving the results of these tests. Among 3634 total participants in Sex Now 2018, 85% (3106 participants) provided DBS samples for HIV and HCV testing. HIV was detected in 7% of all DBS samples and HCV infection was found in 0.3% of all DBS samples. 2% of the DBS samples did not have a sufficient sample that could be tested for HIV and 4% were insufficient for HCV testing. Most of the participants opted into receiving the results of the HIV and HCV tests. Sex Now 2018 represents the largest cross-sectional survey using DBS as a way of collecting biological samples for testing. DBS sampling had a reasonably high uptake, and the majority of DBS samples were sufficient for laboratory testing. Public health organizations and health survey researchers could benefit from using DBS sampling, with the option of returning participants' test results, as a relatively easy way of measuring HIV and HCV in specific populations that are affected by these viruses."

In partnership with the Métis community of Île-à-la-Crosse, SK, and guided by Aboriginal ecological epistemology, this population health intervention research project will fill the knowledge gap and provide evidence of the effectiveness of current and emerging program and policy interventions promoting aging well for Métis and other Aboriginal peoples. Over a five-year period, this project will reveal concepts and experiences of healthy aging in discussion groups, interviews, and photo projects with children, adults, and seniors. Seniors will also complete activity, diet, and quality of life measures at regular intervals. Finally, formal and informal supports and services available to seniors in the community will be systematically identified, with a selection undergoing evaluation. Along with effectiveness of selected interventions, gaps and overlaps between them will be identified. Our analysis will consider sex and gender to better understand the specific needs of men and women for a healthy aging experience. Graduate student and community trainees will be involved in all stages of data collection, and in the design, piloting, and evaluation of mini interventions. The findings will enhance aging well strategies in the research community, and more broadly in other Aboriginal communities, looking to improve the health status of this growing population in Canada."

Impact of COVID-19 public health measures and lockdown on maternal and neonatal health,"['Aboulatta, Laila']",['N/A'],"['Administrative Health Database', 'Interrupted Time Series', 'Mother-Infant Health', 'Perinatal Health', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pregnancy And Neonatal Health', 'Quasi-Experimental Design']",150000.0,474531,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought exceptional challenges to global health. In Canada, a lockdown strategy was announced in March 2020 as a plan to control the spread of the novel coronavirus. However, there is an increasing concern that the pandemic lockdown might have negatively affected health services and patient outcomes, including mother and infant health. In many instances, the decreased access to health services created sub-optimal mother and infant care. In fact, primary studies show that pregnancy adverse outcomes, such as stillbirth, may have increased during the pandemic, merely due to the lockdown effects. Despite the increasing evidence of the negative effects of COVID-19 infection on pregnant women, studies evaluating the effects of the pandemic restrictions on pregnant women and newborns have shown conflicting results. 

My project has several goals that target this knowledge gap. First, we aim to compare the pregnancy outcomes occurring before and during the pandemic, focusing on the major pregnancy and newborn outcomes. Second, we will examine major medication classes used among pregnant women pre- and during the COVID-19 period.  Third, we will examine the adequacy of health care received by pregnant women during this stressful period. We will use real-world data of linked mother-infant records from over 70,000 pregnancies to highlight the impact of pandemic restrictions on mothers and infants in Manitoba.  Our studies can provide evidence to improve mother and infant's health care and prevent negative outcomes during future waves and pandemics."

Overall, new drugs and treatments contribute to the improvement of the population health and increasing life expectancy. However, there are concerns about potential adverse effects of some medications and it is not always clear which of the alternative drugs that are currently used to treat a given disease are the most effective. Thus, evaluation of comparative effectiveness and safety of treatments is a top priority for both the health research and the society at large. 

Evaluations of the effects of treatments on the health outcomes typically rely on large long-term studies and have to account for differences in both the characteristics of the patients and the dose and duration of treatment. Scientific validity of the results and conclusions of such studies depends critically on the accuracy of statistical methods used to analyze such complex data.  The overall objective of our proposal is to develop new statistical methodology for analyzing large studies of comparative effectiveness and safety of medications. The proposed new methods will account for the changes over time in drug use and doses, and for the complexity of biological processes linking medication use and the clinical, socio-economic, behavioral and environmental characteristics of the patients with the clinical outcomes such as mortality, infections or hospitalizations. These new methodological developments will build on our ongoing research on flexible statistical methods for analyzing effects of treatments and risk factors that change over time. 

Our new methods will help efficient identification of adverse effects and accurate comparison of therapeutic effectiveness of alternative drugs used to treat many diseases. This, in turn, will permit optimizing drug prescribing practice, to minimize the risks and maximize therapeutic benefits."

Most new drugs help improve patients' health, their quality of life and life expectancy, but some may have important unintended side effects while other may be less effective than existing, often less expensive, 'older' medications. Thus, an accurate assessment and comparison of the safety and effectiveness of alternative medications has become one of the primary objectives for both public health agencies and patients' organizations. Accordingly, considerable resources are invested in research attempting to link data on the use of specific medications with both intended and unintended health outcomes. In Canada, such research endeavors are largely facilitated by the existence, in several provinces, of large, administrative databases that contain complete information on both health outcomes and prescriptions received by individual subjects. However, to draw scientifically valid and rigorous conclusions from the analyses of population-based studies of drug safety or effectiveness, we have to address several methodological challenges. For example, patients prescribed a new drug may be more likely to have a more advanced disease and additional risk factors than those not given any drug or prescribed a less expensive older drug. If not accounted for, such differences in the characteristics of drug users may lead to biased results and incorrect conclusions. In addition, differences in the treatment duration and dose of drugs used by different patients, possibly due to treatment non-adherence, may also affect the accuracy of the results. We propose several new statistical methods that will address the above challenges and will permit more accurate assessments of the safety and effectiveness of different drugs used by Canadians. Our new methods may also help designing more rational treatment regimens, to maximize health benefits while reducing the risks of serious adverse events."

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and measures taken to limit the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes COVID-19, have directly and indirectly disrupted access to healthcare and social services worldwide, including harm reduction and social support services. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, BC witnessed large increases in drug overdose related deaths, with 2021 being the deadliest year. This requires scaling up of existing interventions and introducing new, targeted interventions to address the overdose crisis. The level and type of response is also affected by the perception of the population towards health issues and debate on intervention options. The information available on social media could help decision makers understand the public discourse about opioid use and intervention options.

The first wave of the enormous baby boomer cohort has now reached the age of 65 years and, in two decades, one-in-five citizens will be ""older adults"".  This has demanded increased attention to supporting the health of the aging population (1), in part by disseminating health information for those over the age of 65 years and health practitioners who work with this segment of the population.  In particular, there has been an emphasis placed on the role of healthy lifestyle information and aging (2, 3).  However, despite the plethora of identified benefits of active living [in particular] to healthy aging (4), older Canadians spend an alarming 69% of their waking time in sedentary activities (5), live with at least one chronic condition, and thus spend less time engaged within their communities (1).
There are many barriers that exist in the effective transfer of health information knowledge and application of best practice knowledge to the intended target population; however it is clear that messaging relating to active living, in particular, has fallen short of making a broad impact (5,6).  There currently does not exist a formal network to provide an outlet for healthy aging researchers to disseminate their work and reciprocally, for community organizations promoting healthy active living to access and apply evidence-based research findings; the process currently dependent on informal outreach.   To facilitate the availability and dissemination of healthy active aging related information we propose to bring together relevant stakeholders and trans-disciplinary knowledge producers to lay the foundation in the establishment of a network and the development of a knowledge exchange strategy/pathway.

The efficacy of calorie labelling formats on pre-packaged foods: an experimental study among youth and young adults in Canada,"['Acton, Rachel']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,345742,"Background
Several countries have proposed changes to calorie labelling on Nutrition Facts tables on pre-packaged foods. Most research to date has examined general use of Nutrition Facts tables, with a lack of evidence to guide specific design changes to calorie information on labels. This study examined the efficacy of various calorie labelling formats on recall, comprehension, and consumer preferences for calorie information. 

Methods 
Experiments were conducted as part of an online survey with a national sample of 2,008 Canadians aged 16 to 24. In Task 1, participants were briefly shown one of six labelling formats (e.g., %DV, traffic light symbol) with calories in either small or large font, and asked to recall the amount of calories. Task 2 examined comprehension of calories in the context of the recommended daily intake, using the same Nutrition Facts table as in Task 1. Task 3 identified participants' preferences for labelling formats. 

Results 
More than half of the participants reported looking at calorie information ""often"" or ""always"" when they looked at the Nutrition Facts table on a food package. Nutrition Facts tables with calories in large font enhanced calorie recall (p<.001). When small font was displayed, the Traffic Light format was significantly better at improving recall than all other formats (p<0.01). When large font was displayed, the highest recall among the six labelling formats was in the Current, RDI, and Traffic Light formats (p<.05 for all). Comprehension of number of servings per RDI was highest in the Infographic format, with no difference by font size (p<.001). The large font calorie condition and the Infographic format were most preferred (p<.001).

Conclusions 
Enhancements in visibility and design can improve the efficacy of calorie labelling on pre-packaged foods. The findings have direct implication for proposed changes to calorie labelling on Nutrition Facts tables in Canada and the US."
Front-of-package nutrition labels: experimental evidence to guide national and global policy development,"['Acton, Rachel']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,400459,"As part of the Healthy Eating Strategy, the Canadian government is developing a range of new food policies to promote healthy diets, including the introduction of mandatory front-of-package (FOP) nutrition labels that will label foods high in sugars, sodium and saturated fats. There is also growing interest in FOP labelling policies globally: several FOP labels are in place in other countries (e.g., traffic light labels in the UK, Health Star Ratings in Australia, 'high in' nutrient warnings in Chile, 5-colour Nutri-Score labels in France), and many other countries are working to introduce their own FOP labelling strategies. There is an urgent need for evidence to guide the successful development of these labelling policies, including evidence to compare the relative efficacy of different labelling formats. 
This symposium will provide an overview of FOP labelling and summarize findings from three studies investigating the impact of FOP nutrition labelling systems. The studies presented in this symposium use innovative research designs (both Canadian and international) to assess consumer understanding and purchasing behaviours in response to different FOP labelling systems. All studies compared different FOP label designs to explore differences between Canada's proposed 'high in' system and other common FOP label formats used internationally. Delegates attending this symposium will gain an understanding of the status of FOP regulations in Canada and internationally, and will become familiar with different experimental methods that can be used to assess FOP labels and other nutrition policies. The session will also provide a context for discussion of the potential benefits, weaknesses and policy implications of the many different FOP nutrition labelling formats."
Monitoring and evaluation of Canada's Healthy Eating Strategy,"['Acton, Rachel']",['N/A'],"['Food Marketing', 'Nutrition Policy', 'Policy Evaluation', 'Survey Methods']",108500.0,449215,"Poor dietary intake is a leading risk factor for non-communicable disease in Canada. Pre-packaged foods high in sodium, sugars and saturated fats account for an increasing proportion of the food supply, making it increasingly challenging for Canadians to make healthy choices.

This program of work aims to evaluate Canada's Healthy Eating Strategy through a collaboration between the Office of Nutrition Policy and Promotion at Health Canada and the University of Waterloo. The Healthy Eating Strategy was announced in 2016 as a landmark policy framework to address dietary risk factors for chronic disease, and incorporates a variety of policy approaches, including updates to Canada's Food Guide and restrictions on food and beverage marketing to children. Health Canada is now in the process of developing approaches to: (1) monitor the extent and impacts of food and beverage marketing to children in Canada, (2) evaluate the short-term impacts of Canada's new Food Guide, and (3) evaluate the Healthy Eating Strategy as a whole. This program of work will utilize the research expertise of the Health Systems Impact Fellow to address these three needs.

The objectives of this work will be supported by data from the International Food Policy Study (IFPS) at the University of Waterloo, which collects annual data on key food policy indicators from adults and youth across six countries, including Canada. Data from the IFPS will provide information that is critical to the evaluation of the Healthy Eating Strategy, such as frequency and sources of exposure to food and beverage marketing. The Fellow will lead data analysis and knowledge translation activities for the three objectives described above, and will serve as a liaison between Health Canada and the University of Waterloo to ensure efficient and appropriate use of the data. Ultimately, this work will help to ensure the Healthy Eating Strategy has a positive impact on the health and quality of life of Canadians."

This research aims to better understand the nature of HIV risk amongst TMSM.  Its goal is to enhance the well-being of TMSM by collecting in-depth information about their sexual health issues, concerns, sexual decision-making processes, and the social context of their lives.  This study will create a base for effective and culturally-relevant knowledge exchange by providing a detailed and rich understanding of how social exclusion works to produce unique HIV prevention and sexual health challenges for TMSM in Ontario.  

In this project, we will undertake a qualitative exploration of the experiences of TMSM in Ontario. Forty in-depth interviews will be conducted with TMSM, providing opportunities to discuss more complex issues related to identity, sexuality, sexual health and service needs.  

In the Canadian context, there is a dearth of knowledge about the health- and HIV-related issues facing TMSM.  This project will contribute significantly to the limited pool of information available about TMSM by providing in-depth information focussed specifically on their unique needs.  Moreover, it will provide a theoretical understanding of what TMSM  experience thus enabling us to create a rich and comprehensive understanding about the extent and scope of social exclusion in these communities and the impact on sexual health as well as HIV risk.  This qualitative study will also provide a rich understanding of the ways that social exclusion may impact access to HIV prevention services for TMSM."
The role of self-management in people's early rheumatoid arthritis help-seeking experience,"['Adam, Kathleen E']",['N/A'],"['Early Intervention', 'Help-Seeking', 'Qualitative Research', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Self-Management']",4950.0,205365,"Recent research suggests that up to 38% of people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) waited longer than three months to see a family physician for joint symptoms. However, little is known about factors associated with the initiation of medical consults. In the Early RA Help-Seeking Experience (ERAHSE) study, we interviewed 38 people who were recently diagnosed with RA and found that the decision to seek help was influenced by the complex interplay of factors, including: 1.) severity and nature of symptoms; 2.) impact of symptoms on function and participation in social roles; 3.) prior experience with medical professionals; and 4.) knowledge about arthritis and other chronic diseases. During the early phase, people tried different ways to manage their symptoms, such as looking for information, changing their daily activities, adjusting their work environment, and/or using over-the-counter remedies. In some, these 'self-management' activities facilitated the decision to seek information and medical treatment for the early symptoms, but in others, the expectation to self-manage appeared to contribute to a delay in seeking help.

The purpose of this undergraduate student project is to understand the role of self-management from the onset of RA symptoms to the first visit to a health professional. Using a narrative approach, the analysis will focus on two areas: 1.) the strategies used by individuals to cope with the early symptoms in the context of their everyday lives; and 2.) how self-management facilitated or hindered the process to seek-help. During the 3-month funding period, the candidate will be mentored by a multidisciplinary team to develop skills in the analysis of qualitative data, manuscript writing and presentation. Furthermore, she will gain first-hand experience in working with patients/consumers in health research and knowledge translation."

Particular focus will be placed on areas with unique combinations of case exposure and vaccine coverage to reveal what life has been like for people living on the 'front lines' of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are particularly interested in what combinations of factors led to high exposures and how families and communities worked together to support each other during the crisis. We are also interested in the roles played by young adults in immigrant families as interpreters of health information. Furthermore, we are interested in what sources of information people use to determine what behaviours are risky or safe concerning COVID-19, particularly around vaccines. Our overall goal is to contextualize the pandemic experiences of racialized individuals, families, and communities in ways that offer new insight into the factors that shaped the disproportionately high burden of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality borne by these communities.

Community alert systems for locating missing older adults,"['Adekoya, Adebusola A']",['N/A'],"['Dementia', 'Missing Persons', 'Older Adults', 'Policy', 'Technology']",1500.0,497870,"Older adults living with dementia are at risk of going missing and being exposed to serious harm, including death. Alert systems such as United States' Silver Alert, Scotland's Purple Alert and Canada's BC Silver Alert notify the public about missing persons with dementia and aid search and rescue efforts. However, little is known about how policies and programs for alert systems are developed and implemented. Further, the process of development, implementation, and use of alert systems can exclude older adults, create a digital divide, and contribute to ageism if they are unable to access or engage with these technologies. The use of alert systems raises ethical and legal issues such as stigma and shame, violation of privacy rights, and the potential for abuse by disclosing personal information such as name, medical conditions, or home address to the public. This study will use a case study approach to examine the process of policy development and implementation of alert systems to locate missing older adults with dementia in Canada, Scotland, and the United States. This study will also explore how the development, implementation, and use of alert systems contribute to ageism. Policy documents related to development and implementation of alert systems such as guidelines and project reports will be reviewed. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with 30 stakeholders such as older adults, care partners, Alzheimer Societies, first responders, technology developers, and policy makers to explore their perspectives on the process of policy development and implementation of alert systems and how this process and use of alert systems contribute to ageism. This study will contribute to a better understanding of policy development and implementation of alert systems. Findings will be used to inform policies and implementation of alert systems and provide recommendations to address ageism and enhance the safety and well-being of older adults at risk of going missing."

Evidence of health inequity in child survival: spatial and Bayesian network analyses of stillbirth rates in 194 countries,"['Adeyinka, Daniel A']",['N/A'],"['Global Health', 'Health Inequity', 'Machine Learning', 'Maternal And Child Health', 'Social Determinants Of Health', 'Spatial Analysis']",1265.0,418300,"Introduction: Stillbirths, at 2.6 million annually worldwide, remains stubbornly high; this is in contrast to neonatal and under-five mortality rates worldwide which has shown a decrease in recent years. Stillbirth is a neglected public health challenge globally. The global target of 9 stillbirths per 1000 total births, and national target of 12 per 1000 total births (especially in the Low and Middle Income Countries) by 2030 will be difficult to achieve at current rates. Studies heretofore have not quantified the relationship between stillbirth and its social determinants, leaving an evidence-gap for decision making, policy and practice.

Main findings: Stillbirth rates varied across all countries with an average rate of 12.8 per 1000 total births. Thirty-seven countries (all from African continent) formed a cluster of high stillbirth rates (hot-spots); 13 countries formed a cluster of low stillbirth rates (cold spots), (from Central Asia and Canada). Society-wide gender inequality, anaemia in pregnancy were significant factors associated with  higher stillbirth rates; while higher antenatal care coverage (ANC), skilled birth attendants during delivery were factors associated with lower stillbirth rates. A 44% improvement of stillbirth rate was associated with: skilled birth attendants during delivery increased from 70% to 88%, ANC coverage increased from 55% to 70%, prevalence of anaemia in pregnancy decreased from 27% to 11%, and gender inequality index decreased from 43% to 21%.

Call to action: Recognizing the urgency in reducing stillbirths globally, multi-pronged strategies should be designed to promote gender equality and strengthen the reproductive and maternal health services-infrastructure in Africa, Eastern Mediterranean, and South Eastern Asia.Factors that place women at disadvantageous positions (low level education and literacy, economic insecurity, violence) are foundational and long-lasting solutions to address stillbirth rates."
"Examining Neighbourhood Socioeconomic Status, Anxiety during Pregnancy, and Preterm Birth","['Adhikari Dahal, Kamala']",['N/A'],"['Anxiety During Pregnancy', 'Cohort Study', 'Multilevel Analysis', 'Preterm Birth', 'Socioeconomic Status']",150000.0,361886,"In Canada, one in every twelve babies is born premature. Premature birth is defined as the birth of a baby prior to reaching 37 weeks of pregnancy. One in three deaths of newborn babies is related to premature birth. Among survivors, breathing problems, vision and hearing problems, and learning issues are common. Pregnant women living in disadvantaged neighborhoods tend to have higher rates of premature birth. Disadvantaged neighborhoods are defined as areas where many people are less educated, poor, and unemployed. However, it is not well understood how living in a disadvantaged neighborhood contributes to premature birth. It is known that pregnant women living in those neighborhoods are more likely to be anxious due to financial hardships. Thus, being anxious during pregnancy may play a role in the increased occurrence of premature birth in those neighborhoods, although this has not been examined. 

This research will use data from two community-based studies in Calgary that includes 5,588 pregnant women. Information about characteristics of pregnant women, their anxiety, and premature birth will come from those studies. Information about neighborhood characteristics (income, education, and employment) of those women will come from the 2011 Canada census data. This information will be used to look at whether living in a disadvantaged neighborhood and being anxious during pregnancy contributes to premature birth. 

This research is important because it will add new knowledge on who is at most risk for premature birth. The findings will be beneficial to the public, health professionals, research community, and policy makers. Determining who is at highest risk for premature birth can inform policy makers to design and implement public health programs targeting those populations. This leads to decrease premature birth and its related deaths and health problems in children."

As a result, in contemporary research, fathers' grief has been studied primarily in comparison to mothers' grief.  This distortion has lead to the misleading perception, in some bereavement studies and theories, that fathers' experience of grief is less intense and debilitating than that of mothers'. This has been reported in studies of infant death , catastrophic accident death, and death from childhood cancer. 

This study is designed to examine fathers' moral experience of bereavement, using a phenomenological as well as ethical analysis. The methods will include a series of interviews conducted with approximately 15 bereaved fathers over the course of 12 months. The study will address the bereaved fathers'moral experience, specifically addressing issues of 1) Bereaved fathers' experiences with social expectation and regulation; 2) Bereaved fathers' challenges with issues of  morality (e.g., what it means to be a good father, a good spouse, a good mourner); 3) Bereaved Fathers' experiences with and opinions of health care services, including bereavement support services. 

By focusing on the lived experience of bereavement as fathers describe it, the common proclivity of comparing fathers' grief to that of mothers' will be avoided. This study is designed to show how the experience of bereaved fathers' is gendered, and must be examined in relation to such issues as emotional disposition, social and familial expectations, and internalized standards of proper behavior. This study will contribute to building both a theoretical and clinical evidence base for the field of bereavement studies and in so doing provide a substantial contribution to the interdisciplinary world of grief counseling."

Recommendations will also be sought from participants for how the uptake of suicide prevention programs in larger communities can be improved. The knowledge produced by this study will help communities and policy makers design more effective suicide prevention services for Nunavik Inuit, particularly those from larger urban centers."

A serious gap remains between understanding the harms related to child maltreatment and effective prevention strategies. My goal is to prevent child maltreatment and thereby change a child’s trajectory, improve health, and strengthen families. This requires understanding child maltreatment using Canadian data, developing evidence-based interventions aimed at preventing child maltreatment before it occurs, preventing child maltreatment recurrence, and preventing associated mental and physical health problems.The program objectivesare to: 1) understand the size and scope of child maltreatment within a Canadian context and how it relates to health and health services; 2) identify protective factors associated with a decreased likelihood of child maltreatment and increased likelihood of improved health outcomes following child maltreatment; 3) apply this new knowledge to develop a new evidence-based intervention strategy or to modify an existing program; and 4) begin to evaluate this newly developed or modified intervention strategy to determine effectiveness in preventing child maltreatment and its associated mental and physical health impairment.Advance knowledge and anticipated health outcomes.Theshort-termgoals are to advance child maltreatment knowledge in Canada, to identify protective factors related to prevention, and to develop (or modify) an intervention strategy. Thelong-termgoals are to evaluate and implement strategies to prevent child maltreatment and to reduce the likelihood of poor health outcomes following child maltreatment. Importantly, this program will be the first to measure potential decreases in child maltreatment and mental and physical health conditions and health services use over time at the population level.Expertise.I have international expertise in child maltreatment research with in-depth knowledge of mental health, resilience, prevention, and knowledge translation (KT). I have published 65 peer-reviewed journal articles, presented at 68 conferences, and conducted over 100 media interviews resulting in over 1500 news stories worldwide. My work is highly cited (1808 citations) and has been used to inform policies on the use of physical punishment. I have received numerous awards and have been recognized as one of Canada’s leading mental health researchers. My methodological expertise is in advanced quantitative methods for population-based data. My program experts are academics, knowledge users, and a trainee and provide further expertise in: child health; mental health; child maltreatment policy; children’s rights and laws; child advocacy; data collection; administrative data; qualitative analysis; and development, implementation, and evaluation of intervention strategies.Mentoring and Training Activities.My mentorship provides comprehensive training and opportunities for further professional development. My plan includes partnering junior students with senior student mentors, working collaboratively, providing specialized teaching, meeting with students regularly, and involving students in grant writing, publishing, and KT. Success of my mentorship can be measured with my students having won research awards, published articles, been admitted to medical school, and been offered research placements at prestigious institutions (e.g., Harvard, Yale, Stanford)."
The epidemiology of resilience following child maltreatment: An examination of protective factors across the lifespan.,"['Afifi, Tracie O']","['Boyle, Michael H', 'Macmillan, Harriet L', 'Sareen, Jitender']","['Child Maltreatment', 'Epidemiology', 'Gender', 'Intervention', 'Lifespan', 'Mental Health Promotion', 'Population Health', 'Protective Factors', 'Resilience', 'Risk Factors']",46354.0,259730,"To date, child maltreatment research has focused mainly on risk factors and poor outcomes with fewer studies examining resilience following child maltreatment and protective factors associated with mental health (e.g., absence of mental disorders and high quality of life). Resilience is generally described as the ability to maintain or regain mental health after adverse exposure. A protective factor is an indicator that is associated with an increased likelihood of a positive outcome. A review of the literature indicated that supportive relationships show a consistent association with healthy outcomes. What is still largely unknown is the prevalence of mental health in the general population following child maltreatment exposure in comparison to non-maltreated individuals. What other protective factors are associated with mental health and how can resilience be enhanced? Fostering resilience after child maltreatment has the potential to improve mental health for individuals and populations. The current proposal is unique because it will lead to new knowledge that will guide the development of intervention strategies to promote protective factors in facilitating resilience among individuals with a history of child maltreatment exposure across the lifespan-from adolescence to later adulthood. An epidemiological perspective will be applied to understand the prevalence of child maltreatment and mental health, the relationship between protective factors and mental health cross-sectionally and over a 3-year period. Noted strengths of this research include accessing large nationally representative Canadian and US data, examining sex and gender differences, using a lifespan approach, accessing longitudinal data, using high quality measures of child maltreatment and mental health, and inclusion of several protective factors in one study."

ACEs typically include experiences of child maltreatment (including emotional abuse, emotional neglect, physical neglect, physical abuse, and sexual
abuse) and household challenges (including parental divorce or separation, parental substance use, parental mental health problems, parental problems with the law or incarceration, and exposure to intimate partner violence). Peer bullying or peer victimization is also an adverse experience in childhood and adolescence and is associated with a greater
likelihood for having problems with substance use, mental health problems, and physical health conditions. To date, no studies have examined which protective factors help to reduce the likelihood of substance use problems, mental problems, and physical health conditions
among those with an ACEs and/or peer bullying history among youth. This is important because identifying protective factors that improve health outcomes can then be used to inform the development and evaluation of interventions that could lead to better health for Canadians across the lifespan. The main aims of this work are to determine: 1) which protective factors during adolescence are related to decreasing the likelihood of substance use, mental health problems, and physical health conditions in early adulthood among those with an ACEs and/or peer bullying history; 2) what protective factors lessen the impact of ACEs and/or peer victimization on substance use, mental health problems, and physical health conditions; and 3) if the prevalence of ACEs, peer bullying, and health outcomes varies by sexual identity and gender identity.  This work has the potential to build resilience in adolescents and young adults and decrease substance use, mental health problems, and physical health conditions."

US veterans with cannabis problems are more likely to seek treatment mental health problems (Ecker et al., 2020). Similar information about Canadian veterans is unknown. However, people who use cannabis are generally more likely to use other substances and to have mental disorders (Hasin, 2016). In addition, child abuse history and deployment-related traumatic events (DRTEs) among Canadian Forces members are related to suicidal thoughts and mental disorders (Afifi, et al., 2016; Afifi, under review). The health and well-being of male and female veterans in Canada can be improved by better understanding of how child maltreatment history and DRTEs are related to using cannabis and if cannabis use is related to an increased likelihood of other substance use, having mental disorders, suicidal behaviour (i.e., thoughts, plans, attempts), and seeking help for mental health problems. The proposed research is designed to determine: 1) the prevalence of past year cannabis use in a sample of male and female Canadian veterans; 2) if child maltreatment history and DRTEs are related to an increased likelihood of cannabis use among male and female veterans; 3) the association between past-year cannabis use on other substance use, mental disorders, suicidal behaviour, and perceived need for mental health treatment, help seeking for mental health problems, and barriers to mental health care; and 4) how child abuse history, DRTEs, and co-occurring mental health conditions may change the relationships between cannabis use and perceived need for treatment, help seeking for mental health problems, and barriers to mental health care. The team are experts in mental health, veterans' health, substance use, trauma, and child maltreatment. Data will be used to improve mental health outcomes for veterans by informing policy and clinical practice."

More recently, electronic vaping products (such as e-cigarettes, e-cigars, vape pipes, vaping pens) have become the most common nicotine product in the US among youth. Less is known about vaping in Canada. However, research from our group found that 27.8% of adolescents from a Manitoba community sample have used a vaping product in the last 30 days. Our research has also found that adolescents who experience childhood adversity and bullying are more likely to vape. Information is now only emerging on the impacts of vaping on health with most of this research focused on adults. Less is known about poor health outcomes among adolescents with most of this work only looking at symptoms related to vaping like coughing, dizziness, headaches or migraines, dry mouth, shortness of breath, and loss of taste. Less is known about the impact vaping has on health conditions, use of the healthcare system, and if differences exist in these relationships for males and females. As well, it is currently unknown if parent vaping or smoking cigarettes increases the likelihood of adolescent vaping, if adolescents with mental health conditions are more likely to vape, and vaping is used as a negative coping mechanism. This knowledge would be useful to help develop vaping policies aimed at reducing vaping and improving health. The goals of the current research are: 1) to understand the course of vaping (i.e., never vaping, quitting, starting later, or continuous vaping) among adolescents and what factors may be related to the course; 2) to understand if vaping is associated with using other substances; 3) to determine if vaping is used as a way to cope with problems; and 4) to understand the impact vaping has on health conditions and use of the health care system among male and female adolescents and young adults. Understanding differences between males and females will be a main focus of each research aims."
"Déterminants socioculturels du recours à l'accouchement assisté par les nomades de Gossi, au Mali : Etude qualitative.","['Ag Ahmed, Mohamed Ali']",['N/A'],"[""Bourses De Voyage D'Aci""]",1500.0,391481,"Les nomades sont nombreux en Afrique (30 à 60 millions). Ils se déplacent avec leurs animaux à la recherche des pâturages et des points d'eau. Cette mobilité leur rend inaccessible les services de santé conçus pour des sédentaires. Pour les femmes nomades, le fait de ne pas accoucher dans ces centres de santé entraine une forte mortalité. Mais jusque là on ne sait pas trop pourquoi ces femmes n'accouchent pas dans les centres de santé au Mali. L'objectif de cette recherche est de comprendre les déterminants socioculturels qui leur empêchent d'accoucher dans les centres de santé.  
Pour cela, pendant trois mois nous nous sommes rendus dans les campements nomades au sein de leurs pâturages dans la commune de Gossi au Mali. Nous avons mené 26 entretiens avec les femmes nomades ayant accouché ou pas dans les centres de santé. Puis nous les avons observé au sein de leurs campements et lorsqu'elles viennent dans les centres de santé. 
Nos résultats montrent que ces femmes reconnaissent en majorité l'efficacité des services de santé. Cependant, elles n'y accouchent pas en raison de leur culture, leurs traditions et le fait que ce sont les hommes qui décident pour elles. En effet, elles pensent que leurs corps sont capables d'accoucher sans aide et doivent montrer qu'elles sont braves et courageuses. Aussi, ces femmes ne peuvent pas se déplacer sans la permission et l'accompagnement des hommes. De même, elles ne travaillent pas et ne gagnent donc pas de l'argent pour payer pour les soins. C'est seulement lorsque l'accouchement se complique que la famille décide d'amener la femme au centre de santé. 
En conclusion, cette étude montre que les déterminants socioculturels sont importants et empêchent les femmes d'accoucher dans les centres de santé. Ils doivent donc être pris en compte pour mettre en place des services de santé qui leurs sont adaptés."
Evaluating the enhanced Community-based Health Education and Communication (eCHEC) model in improving the knowledge and behaviours of community residents on known risk factors and protective factors for preventing Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) in Khon Kaen Thailand,"['Agarwal, Gina (Ragini)']",['N/A'],"['Community-Based Health Education', 'Effectiveness Evaluation', 'Evidence-Based Intervention', 'Health Policy', 'Liver Cancer', 'Low And Middle Income Countries']",450847.0,437149,"Liver Cancer caused by liver flukes is very common in Khon Kaen Thailand. People get infected with the liver fluke when they eat raw fish that is infected with the fluke. There have been many programs that have tried to prevent this type of cancer. However, it remains a common problem especially in the Northern parts of Thailand.

Researchers from Khon Kaen University have created a Community-Based Health Education and Communication (CHEC) program to prevent intake of raw fish in the communities in Khon Kaen. They have found that this program has improved the knowledge and behaviour of community residents regarding eating raw fish which is part of how the liver fluke infects humans.

In our research we plan to improve the CHEC program and test it in communities in Khon Kaen Thailand. We intend to do an experiment to give the program in some communities in Khon Kaen. We will compare the knowledge and behaviours regarding liver cancer among residents living in communities that received the program and those who live in communities that did not receive the program. We also intend to compare the quality of life of residents living in communities with the program versus the residents in communities without the program.

We believe that an enhanced Community-Based Health Education and Communication (eCHEC) Model can improve the knowledge and behavior of people living the communities regarding prevention of liver flukes and liver cancer. The new eCHEC model will include ways to reduce the key aggravating factors (raw fish consumption, liquor consumption, and praziquantel intake) as well as to improve the protective factors (fresh vegetable consumption). If the program is effective, we will share our results with local health leaders and politicians so that this program can be spread out to more communities that have many cases of liver fluke and liver cancer."
Implementation of Municipal Housing Interventions to improve Healthy Aging and Quality of Life in Canadian Cities,"['Agarwal, Gina (Ragini)', 'Poll, Amy', 'Dunn, James R', 'Wyndham-West, Catherine M']","['Bielska, Iwona A', 'Griffith, Lauren E', 'Kaasalainen, Sharon J', 'Pirrie, Melissa', 'Thabane, Lehana']","['Chronic Diseases', 'Evidence-Based Interventions', 'Health Services', 'Healthy Aging', 'Homelessness', 'Housing', 'Implementation Science', 'Mental Health', 'Older Adults', 'Quality Of Life']",25000.0,459762,"There are many groups of people who experience aging differently due to their race, ethnicity, immigration status, income, or other factors. One reason is that they often face additional barriers in accessing primary care. For example, they may have language barriers or mobility challenges. When they cannot access primary care, this results in higher rates of chronic disease and poor health over their lifespan. By bringing healthcare to where individuals live, it can help to overcome these barriers. The result is better healthcare in the short term and better aging in the long term. 

This research project will focus on two interventions to help overcome these barriers: the Community Paramedicine at Clinic (CP@clinic) Program, and the At Home/Chez Soi program. The CP@clinic Program uses community paramedics to improve the health and quality of life for older adults living in social housing. The At Home/Chez Soi program provides both housing and mental health treatment for individuals experiencing homelessness.  

This research project proposes to implement the CP@clinic and At Home/Chez Soi programs in new municipalities (Surrey and Victoria, British Columbia; Hamilton, Ontario). This process will be evaluated to find out how the program works best, for whom, and in what settings. We will be working with many community partners, including social housing organizations and paramedic services, to achieve this project.

The results will help guide future expansions of the CP@clinic and At Home/Chez Soi programs to other municipalities across Canada. This will improve the delivery of healthcare for many populations that cannot access it and will ultimately improve population health in Canada."

This proposal documents the findings of a unique and innovative community-based strategy in Hamilton Ontario, Neighbourhood Action Strategy (NAS). NAS sets out to improve the well-being of 11 priority communities. By working together with city staff, service providers, and other stakeholders in the community, residents have been planning and enacting initiatives that enhance the health of their community. This has included activities that further develop the social, economic, and physical environments. In-depth interviews were conducted with 60 key informants involved in the initiative and were coded and analyzed using grounded theory. Additionally, participation observation was an ongoing element in identifying the various factors that influence implementation of NAS. Respondents were asked about their thoughts on implementation and what held back or led to progress in implementing their various projects. Although communities have been able to generate change, many participants discussed the challenges associated with the implementing an initiative like this including policy barriers, lack of involvement, and working through conflict. This research is relevant and timely as it illustrates how communities can be best supported in enhancing the social, physical, and health related landscape of their neighbourhoods."
An investigation into the prevalence and risk factors for apathy among newly admitted Canadian long term care residents with and without neurocognitive disorders: A secondary data analysis,"['Agboji, Aderonke']",['N/A'],['Summer Program In Aging 2021'],,443222,"Apathy is a common and persistent problem among older people in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). Many factors can contribute to apathy. These include, but not limited to age, sex, genetics, ethnicity, depression, dementia, and the physical environment. However, there has been no study carried out in Canada looking at the extent to which apathy is prevalent in LTCFs and its associated risk factors.
A person with apathy often experiences loss of motivation or interest in self-directed activities and emotions. If apathy is not detected early or left untreated, it has significant negative effects on those affected, their care partners, and the health care system, including poor quality of life, rapid loss of memory, increased reliance on caregivers resulting in caregiver burden, institutionalization, and increased health care costs. Research has found that those who have apathy are more than two times likely to die early than those without apathy. Despite these negative impacts, evidence suggests that apathy is under-researched and the people affected are under-treated.
The purpose of this proposed research will be to examine the prevalence of apathy and its predictors among newly admitted residents with and without dementia in the Canadian LTCFs using the InterRAI-MDS 2.0 data set over a period of five years (2014-2019). The study will also look at the relationship between apathy and social engagement among this population. It is hoped that the implementation of this project will create awareness about apathy in LTCFs and provide guidance on preventive measures for apathy in LTCFs. This project aligns with CIHR SPA 2021 focus and theme because it aims to use existing data collected over time to determine the various factors that contribute to apathy among newly admitted older adults in LTCFs and thus, provide evidence-based information on the preventive measures for apathy in this population."

While permanent housing is undeniably instrumental in improving both mental and physical health, and overall quality of life, PHAs often encounter barriers to permanent housing because of the stigmatization of HIV/AIDS, reduced opportunities for employment and difficulties in social integration due to experiences of homelessness, substance use or mental health. There remains a dearth of literature on the impact of transitional housing specifically for those who live with HIV/AIDS.  While anecdotal evidence suggests transitional housing is particularly effective for PHAs who struggle with a range of mental and physical health concerns, no study yet documents the impact of transitional housing specifically for PHAs in Ontario. The proposed pilot study will generate preliminary findings on housing-readiness, service use, and changing support needs of PHAs.

This community-based study is grounded in GIPA principles. Peer Research Assistants will conduct in-depth interviews to explore experiences of residents in transitional housing. The preliminary findings will be used to develop a longitudinal study on transitional housing and its impact on housing sustainability and health outcomes for PHAs.  Collaborations forged by the pilot-study will serve to strengthen partnerships among housing provider, decisions makers, and researchers."

In 2023, Nunavik recorded its highest number of tuberculosis diagnoses in the 21st century. From 2021 to 2023, our team's Inuit and First Nations researchers interviewed Nunavik Inuit (Nunavimmiut) in five villages as part of a CIHR-funded project to understand how they and their communities have been affected by TB and related health services. While responses were diverse, it was clear that getting diagnosed and treated for TB were sources of hardship for some. Due to the lack of Nunavimmiut voices and worldviews in decision-making over health services, TB care is not focused on meeting patient or community needs. Our project is undertaken in partnership with Nunavimmiut communities and seeks to improve TB care by increasing Inuit control, oversight, and participation. In order to enact policy changes, community representatives will come together to enshrine their expectations, demands, and aspirations related to TB in a regional declaration. This part of our work uses Parnasimautik, an Inuit approach to community consultation. A declaration will formalize and strengthen the role of Inuit in making TB policy. It will also make sure that health services for TB are more accountable and responsive. A vision for what TB care should look like in Nunavik will guide policy and resourcing decisions towards alignment with Inuit needs and aspirations.  In addition to enacting policy changes through the declaration, our team will support community-led improvement and evaluation of clinical TB care in the field. We will do so by supporting communities as they reshape TB screening, and also treatment of sleeping (latent) TB, to better fit their needs. We will also assist communities as they put in place ways to help people who are struggling to take TB treatment through support based on Nunavik Inuit traditions and ways."
Community-partnered infectious disease modeling to inform Covid-19 policies and advocacy in Nunavik,"['Ahmad Khan, Faiz']","['Geric, Coralie S', 'Heffernan, Jane M', 'Law, Stephanie', 'Lee, Robyn', 'Sandy, Glenda', 'Tcholakov, Yassen']","['Covid-19', 'Dynamic Modeling', 'Infectious Disease Modeling', 'Nunavik']",249658.0,462706,"In mid-October 2021, Covid-19 finally arrived in epidemic form in Nunavik.

Life in the region has been heavily impacted, including closure of schools, non-essential businesses, and limitations on intra- and extra-regional travel.

Public health and medical services policymakers have to make decisions, quickly, in such circumstances. Nunavik is distinct with respect to  demographics, geography, availability of medical services, socioeconomic conditions, and its historical-political context. This uniqueness means that copy-pasting tools and choices that have been used in southern Quebec will not suffice. One tool that has been used around the world to help guide public health and medical policy decisions in the face of Covid-19, is infectious disease modelling. 

At the onset of the fall 2021 covid-19 outbreak in Nunavik, a small group of scientists, local clinicians, and community members came together to inform the creation of a dynamic transmission model for one Nunavik village that was most heavily affected by the outbreak. We built the model to be Nunavik specific-- to reflect unique demographics, social interactions (such as frequent inter-generational interactions), and the specific public health measures applied. The model predicts incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths. The collaborative modelling work is one way to increase community participation and leadership in covid-19 related policymaking, and can also provide community health committees with additional advocacy tools (modeling results) that they have helped create. Community participation in modeling increases legitimacy of key parameters that would otherise be impossible to make assumptions around. We are applying for funding to strengthen our modeling approaches and to be able to expand this work to other communities."

Few studies have investigated factors which might explain this association, but none have considered factors within the school environment or potential sex differences in these associations. We tested whether school engagement (i.e. how invested students are in the learning experience) and peer victimization (i.e. being bullied) could explain the association between exposure to maternal depressive symptoms and children's academic performance. We used data from a Canadian study of the general population. Families (n=1173) provided data on maternal depressive symptoms (5 months to 5 years), children's school engagement and peer victimization (6-10 years), and academic performance (12 years). Daughters of mothers experiencing depressive symptoms had lower mathematics, reading, and writing scores, whereas sons only had lower mathematics scores. School engagement and peer victimization explained the association between maternal depressive symptoms in girls, but not in boys. Different mechanisms explain the association between maternal depressive symptoms and academic performance in boys and girls. Prevention and intervention strategies which target school engagement and peer victimization in daughters of mothers experiencing depressive symptoms may help improve girls' academic performance. Further research is needed to identify factors which explain the association in boys."

Children's mental development - that is the cognitive, language, and socioemotional skills children acquire in early life - constitutes the building blocks of a healthy, well-educated, and productive society. Ensuring a healthy early environment is thus an important investment in the long-term outcomes of individuals and the communities in which they live. Research suggests that parenting behaviours and parental mental health - particularly parental depression - are two of the most important determinants of children's mental development, but the mechanisms (i.e., mediators and moderators) through which they shape child development, especially in low- and middle-income country contexts, are only beginning to be explored. The aim of my research project is to use intervention and observational research to better understand the impact of maternal and paternal parenting behaviours and mental health on children's mental development. My objectives are to (1) review and summarize the impact of interventions in low- and middle-income countries to improve maternal and paternal parenting behaviours or treat/prevent maternal and parental depression on children's mental development; (2) examine the mechanisms of the association of maternal and paternal parenting behaviours and mental health with children's mental development in a large South African birth cohort (Birth to Twenty Plus Cohort), and (3) test the efficacy of an intervention comparing the separate and combined effects of improving maternal and paternal parenting behaviours and mental health on children's mental development in Pakistan.

Through an established collaboration between researchers at McGill University and the University of Ghana, we conducted a study on the prevalence and risk and protective factors of young children's mental health problems in Ghana. The objective of this proposal is to engage local community members, policymakers, and academics in dissemination activities focused on children's mental health and wellbeing. Specifically, we will engage in educational workshops and community discussions with community members in the areas where the study was conducted, organize a workshop with representatives from the Ministry of Health and other groups working in mental health to discuss how mental health services can better support young children and their families, and participate in a local scientific conference with researchers from around the country to learn more about ongoing research in child mental health and plan for future studies. This project will not only contribute to ongoing efforts to promote children's mental health in Ghana, but the lessons learned, and the partnerships established will contribute to global evidence-based policies to support families and give children - no matter where they live or who they are - the best start in life."

The survey found that, while most trans participants had a regular primary healthcare provider, 73% felt unsafe in medical offices, and 30% avoided these. Further, 68% of racialized newcomers had access to primary care vs. 85% of non-racialized newcomers. While useful for service delivery, this survey did not capture health status (i.e. specific health conditions/self-rated health) or the full spectrum of social determinants of health, nor lifecourse experiences (age at coming out to family, friends). There was an inability to go deeper into experiences of some subgroups (for example, nonbinary racialized persons). With this, we will conduct a community-based, mixed-methods study to create a health snapshot of 2SLGBTQ+ people in Waterloo Region, Ontario, Canada.

But now, the health of our planet, all Peoples and all living beings, is in crisis. The drivers of this crisis are colonization, capitalism, extractivism, globalization, hetero-patriarchy, and racism, underpinned by associated policies, systems, and structures that reinforce these worldviews. If we want collective futures that sustain all planetary life, we cannot turn to the same systems that created the current conditions. 

The aim of our project is to develop globally impactful research that demonstrates how place-based Indigenous-led resurgence can be synergized across 5 locations (Case Studies) to create an ""Archipelago"" of transformative change. Our proof-of-concept approach focuses on re-establishing healthy lands and healthier Peoples by restoring: cedar cultivation and carving in the Pacific Northwest; the songs, dances, and lessons derived from the Buffalo on the Great Plains; traditional land-based leadership-development practices in Hawaii; community-based health practices in the Mariana Islands; and Indigenous farming, forestry, and fishing practices for sustainable business in Aotearoa. 

This project seeks 3 objectives: 1) Document how each Island's Indigenous-led resurgent activities are contributing to Planetary Health; 2) Create an Indigenous systems-change model that assembles locally based Indigenous-led resurgence into an ""Archipelago of Planetary Health""; 3) Determine the feasibility of our proof-of-concept through Indigenous-led evaluation.

The annual costs of treating these diseases exceed $10 billion, much of which is avoidable if older adults were more physically active. My research will quantify the relationship between physical activity and healthcare costs so that the cost-effectiveness of physical activity interventions can be optimized.

I will (1) describe the relationship between physical inactivity and the development of chronic diseases among older adults based on their individual characteristics; (2) summarize the important elements of cost-effective physical activity interventions among different populations; and (3) show how this information can be used to target populations for whom particular physical activity interventions are likely to be cost-effective, and to optimize the development and delivery of physical activity interventions.

I will use methods from marketing to build computer models that consider a range of individual characteristics and that are flexible to various assumptions (e.g., what if future healthcare efficiencies reduced the cost of treating a disease?). The data required to build these models will come from population health studies and healthcare databases. I will also use methods from economics to discount predicted cost-savings; a dollar spent today is worth more than a dollar saved several years from now because it could be earning interest.

Without corrective action, the costs of treating preventable diseases among Canada's aging population will increase dramatically over the coming decades.

Recent studies have shown that many factors are contributing to worsening mental health in children, including increases in parent stress and harsh parenting, more screen time, and less social contact. On the other hand, several important protective factors have been identified that are supporting children's coping, such as physical activity, healthy sleep routines, and positive parenting. At present, we know little about how these risk and protective factors work together to predict children's mental health, information that is needed to guide recovery efforts. We will recruit 500 parents and children age 9-12 years from the CHILD Cohort Study to participate. The CHILD study has followed over 3400 children from birth to present in four sites across Canada (Vancouver, Edmonton, Manitoba, and Toronto). We will ask parents and children to answer questions twice daily for 2 weeks about parenting, parent stress, social contact, physical activity, sleep, screen time, and children's mental health. We will analyze the data using a new method called dynamic network analysis, which can identify chains of association between items we are measuring. For example, we may learn that reducing parent stress leads to more consistent parenting, which is in turn associated with less screen time and fewer child behaviour problems; or, that more anxious feelings lead to children seeing friends less, creating a cycle of sadness and less social contact. We will also test whether risk and protective factors operate differently depending on child age, parent or child gender, and geographic region. By identifying chains of association and feedback loops between risk and protective factors and mental health, we will provide new information about the most important factors to target in efforts to support children's mental health during the pandemic."

The aim of this project is to determine the health and employee engagement outcomes of job insecurity and what role workplace social capital can play in buffering negative effects. Methods for increasing workplace social capital will be tested to create environments that protect worker well-being. Research is beginning to show that employee well-being has a direct return on investment value to organizations. The results of this study can be used to find ways to increase workplace social capital and thus, improve the health of the workers, their families, the community, and at the same time increase productivity."
Development and implementation of peer-facilitated decision-making and referral support to increase uptake and adherence to HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis in African Caribbean and Black communities in Ontario,"['AJIBOYE, WALE T']",['N/A'],"['African Caribbean And Black Communities', 'Hiv Prevention', 'Intervention Study', 'Peer-Facilitated Decision-Making And Referral Support', 'Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (Prep)']",180000.0,491109,"Almost 1 in 4 Ontarians living with HIV are Black people. This is worrisome, because Black people in Ontario make up just 4.7% of the population but accounts for 25% of new HIV infection. Black communities in Ontario are disproportionately impacted by the HIV epidemic.  To reverse this trend, an effective method to increase the uptake and use HIV prevention medication - HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP)- must be developed and implemented in Black communities in Ontario. 
PrEP is safe and very effective to prevent HIV infection, but the uptake and use in Black communities in Ontario is very low. Previous efforts to increase the use of PrEP in Black communities has failed because they only targeted isolated barriers, facilitators, and contextual factors affecting the uptake and use of PrEP in Black communities. 
Therefore, the overall aim of this study is to increase the proportion of PrEP-eligible Black people who will accept and use PrEP for HIV prevention through the design, development and implementation of a theory-driven intervention strategy that can be replicated in other Black communities in Canada. First (in Phase I), I   will mobilize and utilize knowledge from various sources to design, refine, develop and evaluate the quality of a theory-driven intervention strategy - Peer-Facilitated Decision Making and Referral Support (PrEP-DMR). Then, in Phase II of the study, I will pilot-test the PrEP-DMR with trained peer support workers (Strategic Workers of African and Caribbean Council on HIV/AIDS in Ontario) in selected AIDS Service Organizations (ASOs)/Community Health Centers, to determine acceptability, feasibility, and potential impact on clinical outcomes (PrEP uptake and use). Lessons learnt from the pilot study will guide the design of full implementation trial .  Outcome of this study will inform both practice and policy changes, as well as inform the plan for scale-up of the intervention model in other ACB communities in Canada."

In this Cafe Scientifique grant application, we outline a proposal for facilitating important discussions between health researchers and residents of the Thorncliffe Park community on the role of the sociopolitical environment in shaping patterns of health and disease. In a two part series, we will explore important health-related issues affecting the largely immigrant population at Thorncliffe Park, including food insecurity, lack of access to health services, precarious employment and substandard housing conditions. Focusing particularly on the latter two concerns, and grounded in the social determinants of health literature, we will arrange two panels of speakers to present their research findings on the health consequences of these social conditions. We intend to frame these discussions within the current political climate of economic austerity, which represents a  common  response by many governments to the 2008 economic crisis. We expect that the academic insights of our panelists will generate valuable input from community residents who we recognize as experts on issues concerning their community life. We hope that by putting publicly funded academic knowledge back into public hands, we can democratize access to academic knowledge while at the same time, inform efforts of community residents to improve neighbourhood conditions which negatively impact their health."
Weight bias in the health and education sectors: Implications for population and public health,"['Alberga, Angela S']",['N/A'],"['Eating Disorders', 'Education', 'Environmental Scan', 'Healthcare', 'Interdisciplinary', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Obesity', 'Public Health Campaigns', 'Systematic Review', 'Weight Bias']",140000.0,315724,"Many overweight or obese individuals experience stigma and discrimination. Experiencing weight stigma increases anxiety, depression, disordered eating, suicidal thoughts and avoidance of the healthcare system and lowers self-esteem and quality of life. It has been shown that health professionals and educators have more negative attitudes and stereotypes of people with obesity. Although many studies have observed these biases, little research exists on how to reduce anti-fat prejudice and how to offer practical ways to reduce it. No research has evaluated Canadian public health campaigns or examined university curricula in healthcare or education programs as potential contributors to the high prevalence of weight stigma amongst these professionals. The purpose of this research program is to determine the presence and extent of weight stigma in the curricula of health and education professional training programs and public health campaigns, synthesize the research that aimed to reduce weight stigma and create key practical recommendations for reduction of weight bias in these sectors. This research will change the conversation about weight. Obtaining evidence of the existence of weight stigma and successful strategies used to reduce it will be used to inform and implement future workshops on weight-related issues in university training programs across the country. Providing resources to teach professionals about the negative outcomes of weight bias and providing skill-building advice on the complexity of weight-related issues could improve the delivery of care, and has the potential to positively impact the physical and mental health of patients and students of all sizes. This research goes beyond raising awareness on the existence and extent of weight bias in health and education by providing practical advice and recommendations to help professionals improve quality of care, teaching, and experiences for their patients and students."

Starting discussions about certain topics, especially those about body weight, can be difficult. Previous research has shown that conversation cards are a great way to help patients and healthcare providers start talking about sensitive topics; however, none have been created for pregnant women. This 3-phase, person-centered study will create and evaluate Conversation Cards for Moms (MomCards) with the goal of empowering women to discuss sensitive topics with their providers. 
Step 1: This phase includes recruiting pregnant women living with different pre-pregnancy body mass indices (BMIs) and maternity care providers to participate in virtual focus groups designed to determine topics (e.g., lifestyle behaviours and weight gain) that are important to women and maternity care providers. An analysis of the results will help create the first draft of the topic statements for the MomCards.   
Step 2: Next, the first iteration of the MomCards statements will be sent out to a large sample of Canadian pregnant women and maternity care providers as a survey to refine the statements and rank the most important card statements to have a deck of ~45 MomCards. 
Step 3: Finally, we will test the use of the MomCards with a diverse sample of pregnant women who have different pre-pregnancy BMIs to determine their confidence, acceptability, and feasibility of using the cards as a way to initiate discussions with maternity care providers.  
Each step is critical in helping to create and refine the MomCards in preparation for a clinical trial. In collaboration with key maternal health stakeholders and exchange partners, our goal is to disseminate the cards to inform clinical practices in prenatal maternity care settings. Ultimately, we hope to empower women to discuss topics that matter to them which will in turn improve health outcomes for mom and baby."

Helping people reduce the amount of sodium is an important goal of governments in Canada and around the world. So far, the programs and tools used to help Canadians reduce their sodium consumption have not been impactful. Education campaigns that have been created by governments have narrowly focused on increasing knowledge, without thinking about other factors that may impact a person's behaviour like if they think eating sodium is a risky behaviour or if they have a living circumstance that prevents them from following a lower sodium diet. Knowing these things can help the government design better education programs and policies for sodium reduction. However, the latest research on sodium intake among Canadians was conducted more than 10 years ago and has been limited in many ways. In particular, past research did not explore the true behavioural reasons that impact the amount of sodium a person consumes and has not given deeper knowledge on this topic. My research seeks to understand what are the many other factors affecting sodium intake among Canadians by conducting a large national survey on dietary sodium. In Study 1, I will develop a survey that captures the contextual (e.g., knowledge, family impacts) and behavioural (e.g., risks a person may feel about sodium, their attitudes towards sodium, their intention to reduce sodium) factors related to sodium intake. The survey will be reviewed by experts and tested with 120 Canadians. Next, I will ask 3,380 Canadian adults to fill out the survey. In Study 2, using the survey data, I will assess the behavioural and contextual factors impacting sodium intake. In Study 3, I will measure the change in Canadian's sodium knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours over a 11-year time frame. This study will be the first of its kind and the most detailed research on the factors impacting sodium intake in Canada, and globally."
Child's Behavioral Problems: Prenatal Anxiety Programming Effects and Moderation by Maternal-Child Attachment Security and Child's Sex,"['Ali, Elena']",['N/A'],"[""Children'S Behavioural Problems"", 'Maternal-Child Attachment Security', 'Moderation Analysis', 'Prenatal Anxiety', 'Secondary Data Analysis']",105000.0,383280,"Prenatal anxiety is a major mental health issue that affects approximately 2 in every 10 pregnant women. To date, research has largely focused on the detrimental influence of perinatal depression on children's behavior; however, prenatal anxiety may be even worse for children's development. Prenatal anxiety is thought to result in a ""programming"" effect on fetal brain, and may contribute to the later behavior problems in children. It is known that behavioral problems in children as young as 12 months of age are associated with subsequent adolescent and adult psychopathology. Thus, it is important to prevent these behavioral problems from arising by lessening or alleviating prenatal anxiety.  
The security of a child's attachment to his or her mother is foundational to child's social and emotional skills in later life, and is linked to better behavioral adjustment in children. Maternal-child attachment may thus buffer the negative influence of prenatal anxiety on children's behavioral problems. Further, boys and girls exposed to prenatal anxiety are prone to different behavioral problems, with girls more likely to be anxious and depressed (internalizing behaviors), and boys more likely to be aggressive and hyperactive (externalizing behaviors). A better understanding of how both prenatal (anxiety) and postnatal (maternal-child attachment) factors impact child's behavior has important implications because prenatal anxiety and maternal-child attachment security may be modified by interventions. Ultimately, the findings of this research will inform targeted interventions to prevent anxiety during pregnancy and foster maternal-child attachment, which will improve the health and well-being of families across Canada."

Compared with rich Canadians, poor Canadians are less likely to receive timely screening and thus have worse health conditions, leading to unfair, avoidable differences in health. Reducing unfair, avoidable differences has been recognized as a top priority by the Public Health Agency of Canada, and monitoring these differences is considered an essential step to achieving this goal. 
The current practice in Ontario has enabled health authorities to measure unfair, avoidable differences in the use of preventative screening. However, these differences cannot be tracked over time, and health authorities cannot identify where these differences exist or how large they are. Addressing these barriers will help health authorities monitor unfair, avoidable differences over time, allowing for the development of better health policy to reduce these differences. 
With an application to cancer screening, the proposed research study will develop three indicators - breast cancer screening, cervical cancer screening, and colorectal cancer screening - to measure these unfair, avoidable differences. In partnership with the Ontario Ministry of Health and Public Health Agency of Canada, we will use cancer screening data and Ontario administrative data to track these differences over time. We will develop dashboards to visualize these differences. We will incorporate these indicators into the current practice in Ontario for routinely monitoring differences in the use of preventative services. We will also use dashboards as a practical tool to evaluate the performance of health authorities at a local level.

Without an understanding of the role that contemporary social media plays in the outbreak response, the resultant response may be of limited effectiveness.  

Thus, this project is based on the following research questions: how is social media-based misinformation shaping both public health and lay responses to COVID-19, and what public health strategies and public policies can be adopted to combat such misinformation and its stigmatizing social impacts? 

To address these questions, we will develop and apply a cutting-edge mixed-methods approach that combines big data analysis from computational social science with small data analysis from cultural and interpretive sociology.

In year one, we will scientifically track misinformation about COVID-19 on Western social media platforms -  Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Reddit - as well as on Chinese social media platforms - WeChat, Weibo, Tencent, and Toutiao. This will be supplemented with interviews with public health officials.  In the second year, our analysis will turn towards understanding the effects of social media misinformation about COVID-19, including: xenophobia, racism and stigmatization.

We focus on the following lines of investigation: (i) Social Media, Misinformation and Risk Communication in Outbreak Response; (ii) Misinformation in a Post-Truth Environment: Implications for Outbreak Response; (iii) The Role of Misinformation in the Promotion of Stigmatization, Xenophobia and Racism During the Outbreak; (iv) The Relationship of Social Media and Political Culture in Outbreak Response: A Comparison of China and Canada."

The social determinants of Indigenous health resulting from historic and ongoing colonial policies and practices mean that Indigenous peoples are more likely to experience poverty, under or unemployment, marginal housing or homelessness, food insecurity, barriers to accessing education and economic security, violence, incarceration and apprehension of children by the child welfare system.  There is an urgent need to address the impacts of racism on Indigenous health in Canada.  The proposed meeting aims to build on the discussion paper - First Peoples, second class treatment: Examining the role of racism in the health and well-being of Indigenous peoples - by bringing together Indigenous health researchers, representatives from Indigenous health professional organizations, regional and national public and population health policy makers, and key international experts to share knowledge and increase our collective capacity to understand, evaluate and respond to racism as a driver of disparities in Indigenous health and healthcare access in Canada.  Importantly, the meeting will contribute towards the development of future research capacity by emphasizing the active inclusion of Indigenous graduate students, post-doctoral fellows and community health service providers. Problematically, recent discussions of racism as a determinant of health in the Canadian context have tended to focus on racism as a broad concept, excluding the needs and interests of Indigenous peoples. Examining the role of racism in Indigenous health is fundamental to creating any meaningful change in the alarming and persistent disparities in health and healthcare access experienced by Indigenous peoples in Canada."
"For Our Grandmothers, Aunties, Sisters and Daughters: Identifying Research Priorities in Aboriginal Women's Health","['Allan, Billie']","['Blind, Melissa J']","['Aboriginal Health Research', 'Aboriginal Women', 'Culturally Relevant', 'Culturally Safe', 'Identifying Priorities', 'Stakeholder Gathering']",24600.0,246135,"The Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC) is undertaking to gather key stakeholders to identify priority directions for research in Aboriginal women's health. Key stakeholders will include Elders, community-based representatives, leaders in Aboriginal women's health research and practice, as well as the NWAC Health team. 

Aboriginal women bear a disproportionate burden of ill-health in Canada. They are more likely than non-Aboriginal women to experience hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, several forms of cancer, HIV/AIDS, mental illness, suicide and substance abuse. The ongoing impacts of colonization, including systemic racism and structural violence, have deeply affected Aboriginal women's health and well-being.  These health inequities are further compounded by a lack of culturally safe healthcare policies and practices. The importance of a gendered lens is evident in the higher rates of chronic disease faced by Aboriginal women than Aboriginal men. Community driven, culturally relevant research is foundational to transforming the health and well-being of Aboriginal women, their families, communities and Nations. 

Since 1974, NWAC has worked towards the goal of enhancing, promoting, and fostering the social, economic, cultural and political well-being of Aboriginal women. Through NWAC, this grant provides an important opportunity for Aboriginal women to set a course for research that can significantly improve their health by advancing understanding of their unique needs and circumstances to inform evidence-based health policies and practices. This stakeholder gathering will constitute a meaningful contribution to knowledge building and strategic planning for the IAPH and CIHR more broadly, initiating a community-based, culturally relevant and gender-based map of research directions and priorities for Aboriginal women's health."
Randomized Interventions to Evaluate the Effects of Air Pollution Exposure on Children's Health and Development,"['Allen, Ryan']","['Byambaa, Tsogtbaatar', 'Gombojav, Enkhjargal', 'Lanphear, Bruce P', 'Takaro, Timothy K', 'Venners, Scott', 'Webster, Glenys M']","['Air Pollution', 'Childhood', 'Cognition', 'Exposure Assessment', 'Intervention', 'Neurodevelopment', 'Perinatal', 'Pregnancy', 'Randomized']",720535.0,323521,"There is inconclusive evidence that particulate matter (PM) air pollution exposure during pregnancy may affect brain development.  Air pollution is perhaps the most widespread of all environmental risks - the majority of the world's population breathes air that is considered unhealthy - so effects on childhood development would have substantial and far-reaching implications.  Unfortunately, studies to date have had important limitations and no studies have evaluated the potential for exposure reductions during pregnancy to improve the health and development of young children.  We propose to take advantage of ongoing CIHR-funded work in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, one of the world's most polluted cities, to investigate relationships between PM exposure and children's development.

Portable indoor air filters represent a promising intervention for reducing exposure because they are relatively inexpensive and reduce concentrations indoors, where individuals spend the majority of time.  In our ongoing work in Ulaanbaatar, we are randomly assigning pregnant participants to intervention or control groups, with participants in the intervention group operating air filters in their homes for the duration of pregnancy.  Participants are observed until their child's birth, at which point indicators of fetal growth are evaluated in relation to the mother's exposure during pregnancy.  In this proposed study, we aim to extend observation of these children from birth to age four to evaluate relationships between prenatal exposure and brain development, respiratory health, and allergic symptoms.  The proposed research will answer crucial questions about the effects of air pollution exposure on childhood development, and the potential for air filter use during pregnancy to minimize air pollution's impact on the development of young children."

Unfortunately, studies to date have had major limitations - including poor air pollution exposure assessment, insufficient statistical power, and bias introduced by other risk factors (confounding) - that make interpretation very difficult.  Intervention studies provide the opportunity to overcome many of the limitations of previous studies and can provide compelling evidence of a causal relationship.  Portable indoor air filters represent a promising intervention for reducing exposure to particulate matter air pollution because they are relatively inexpensive and reduce concentrations indoors, where individuals spend the vast majority of time.  This study will use portable indoor air filters in a randomized intervention study to investigate the relationship between particulate matter air pollution and indicators of fetal growth in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, one of the world's most polluted cities.  The large changes in air pollution exposure introduced by this intervention in this highly polluted setting provide a unique opportunity to efficiently and cost-effectively study this potentially important relationship among a relatively small sample of women, while addressing the limitations of previous studies.  In addition,  the outcomes of this study will inform recommendations given to women, both in developing countries and in polluted settings in developed countries, for minimizing air pollution-related risks during pregnancy."

The history of isolation and patterns of early immigration and settlement in Newfoundland and Labrador contributes to a unique population with a number of genetic diseases. This makes Newfoundland interesting to both genetics researchers and social scientists. This research will explore how aspects of biology and the concept of health now shape our individual, social and political identities. The research will investigate how people who have some experience with a genetic disease, as individuals or in their families and communitites, consider the implications for health and well being, social stigma, privacy and medical needs. The project seeks to identify the problems people associate with genetic diagnosis, what they expect from healthcare service providers, and what government insitutions should do in order to maximize acess to information without jeopardizing privacy and confidentiality. The research will be based on interviews with people affected by or concerned with genetic disease in their community.  The project also takes into account that medical technology can shape society. This project will contribute information that will be important for policy makers and health educators as well as health care providers. It will contribute to our knowledge of what people in Newfoundland understand about genetic disease, what information they need and how best to provide it. The information will also provide a useful model for understanding the impact of other medical technologies and biomedical research projects on concepts of personal and community identity."

The CHMS is a regularly repeated survey of the health of Canadians gathering detailed self-report, physical and biological data from a representative sample of people living in Canada. Our proposal is to add relevant and essential oral health clinical and self-report data in Cycle 7 of the CHMS. The project will use Statistics Canada's existing research infrastructure and expertise to address oral health-related knowledge gaps, to explore links between oral and systemic health, and establish a modern, world-class, research platform that will provide numerous opportunities for new research discovery and research training.

This project aims to:
a) Address research objectives and questions beyond those identified in the call for applications, focusing particularly on: social determinants and inequalities in oral health, oral health care and associated impacts; potential adverse effects of common dental treatments; and the relationships between oral and systemic health.
b) Provide capacity building opportunities to a wide range of trainees and early career researchers in oral health-related research and beyond.
c) Partner and collaborate with other large, national databank projects such as Health Data Research Network Canada and the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging, as well as with international peers running similar national oral health surveys in the UK and USA.

The use of data visualization is increasingly recognized as a key knowledge transfer tool to assist in moving this research into action. Instead of searching through pages of tables and graphs, large amounts of information can be understood quickly in a single visual. In 2011, The CIHR Social Research Centre in HIV Prevention (SRC) and the Canadian Foundation for AIDS Research (CANFAR) conducted a survey to gain a better understanding of Canadians' behaviours, attitudes, knowledge and perceptions of HIV and AIDS. This project proposes the creation, piloting and evaluation of a prototype for an online, interactive data visualization tool to disseminate results from the survey. Users will be able to select a research question and view a static image of the data displayed in a map, chart or table format. The target knowledge user for this dissemination activity will be staff of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working in the field of HIV and AIDS. This project will provide the tools and resources necessary to enable NGOs to understand and use the survey data appropriately to better inform service delivery, grant writing, and program and policy development. This application is also responding to a current gap in community knowledge, by building capacity in non-academic individuals to make sense of the research data. Training materials such as online videos will be used to explain concepts related to interpreting the data. The effectiveness of both the training and dissemination prototype to build capacity and disseminate results will be measured and used to inform further development and research into effective methods of knowledge translation and exchange and research uptake."

ASSHH is dedicated to the promotion of critical scholarship in the social sciences and humanities related to HIV/AIDS, to promoting dialogue about social science and humanities research within the scientific community and between researchers and affected communities, and has taken a leading role in supporting new scholars and encouraging the dissemination of HIV social science and humanities research in academic and non-academic settings. 

The International AIDS Conference is the largest international scientific meeting dedicated to advancing knowledge, activism and progress in tackling the global HIV pandemic, attended by over 20,000 delegates. With the support of the International AIDS Society, we intend to align the ASSHH conference with AIDS 2018 in Amsterdam in order to i) raise the profile of the social sciences and humanities in understanding and responding to HIV/AIDS, ii) disseminate the latest social science and humanities research on HIV/AIDS to a global audience, iii) maximize the participation of delegates from around the world, particularly those from low and middle income countries, and iv) give social scientists and humanities scholars, particularly early career researchers, a greater chance of attending and presenting at the world's largest HIV scientific meeting.

Canadian researchers have been active participants within ASSHH since its inception and the first ASSHH conference held in 2011 in South Africa. We anticipate a strong, continuing representation of Canadian researchers at the 2018 ASSHH Conference, which will provide opportunities for Canadian delegates to exchange ideas with their social science and humanities peers, and raise the profile of Canadian HIV research with a global audience."

This proposal outlines a community-based pilot study to explore Sex Workers' Perspectives on Policy and Practice for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in Canada. The proposed study aims to develop and pilot a web-based survey in British Columbia. The survey will gather sex workers' beliefs and attitudes about 1) the perceived suitability of possible ways of making PrEP available to sex workers in Canada, 2) challenges to making PrEP available to sex workers in Canada, and 3) suggestions for education and outreach with regards to the use of PrEP by sex workers. In Canada, recommendations around the prescription and implementation of PrEP for HIV vulnerable individuals and communities continue to be revised with little input from sex workers. Lessons learned from this research with sex workers about PrEP can benefit other marginalized and HIV vulnerable populations that are also exploring ways in which to understand, implement and potentially scale up PrEP, including serodiscordant couples, gay, bisexual and other MSM, and IDU. In Canada, PrEP is a continuing, rapidly-evolving biomedical HIV prevention modality with direct implications for sex workers. In response to this, the proposed study will link university-based and community-based researchers in collaboration in order to develop a community-centred research project to begin to identify the range of sex workers' perspectives on policy and practice for PrEP in Canada. The study will catalyze activities that contribute to the community, the general public, policy makers, service providers and Public Health preparedness for possibilities and limitations presented by new HIV prevention technologies like PrEP."

Generally-speaking, data on religion and religiosity relative to HIV in Ontario and elsewhere in Canada are sparse. This appears to be the case especially for those in Ontario and Canada of the Islamic faith. The 2011 National Household Survey found people who self-identified as Muslim made up 3.2% of Canada's population. This is an increase from the 2.0% reported in the 2001 census, which itself was an increase of 128.9% over 1991. To the best of our knowledge, there are no official statistics on the prevalence of HIV among the Muslim community in Canada. Most of the studies that have focused on HIV and AIDS and Muslim communities have been undertaken in countries outside of Canada. Internationally, available data yield conflicting results with respect to HIV and AIDS among Muslim communities including data on  HIV prevalence, the relationship between religiosity and HIV infection, the contributions Islam can make to HIV prevention, and the intersections of Islamic world-views with HIV risk and resiliency including sexuality, and illicit drug use contexts. The purpose of the proposed project is to conduct a planning process to explore HIV-related knowledge, attitudes and behaviours among young Muslims in Ontario, aged 16-35, with the aim to help stakeholders and policy makers to develop new strategies and approaches to HIV prevention, care, treatment and support among this group.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis is a way for people who do not have HIV but who are at substantial risk of getting it to prevent HIV infection by taking a pill every day. The proposed planning process aims to identify the means and best practices to educate and empower sex workers with regard to PrEP in the context of sex work. The project aims to consider a future mobilization of communities of sex workers by providing an opportunity to discuss the possibilities and limitations of PrEP within their communities, and the role of research within this. The planning process aims to begin to translate the science that underlies many PrEP discourses and disseminate this to build the capacity of sex work communities to engage in local and national dialogue to help ensure that efforts to roll-out and scale-up PrEP activities in the context of sex work can be better informed by a range of community-based voices, including those of sex workers.  No previous opportunity for this knowledge translation has existed for this group. For this planning process The University of Toronto will partner with Triple X Workers' Solidarity Association of B.C. to engage with sex workers, partners and clients in Canada, those who provide health and social care services to them, and those who advocate on their behalf. Strengthening the capacity of sex workers with regards to PrEP will benefit other marginalized and at-risk populations also exploring ways in which to understand, implement and scale up PrEP including serodiscordant couples, men who have sex with men, and injecting drug users."

The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) 2021-2026 Global Strategy identifies inequalities as a major roadblock to end the AIDS epidemic and highlights the necessity to prioritize people who are currently missed by life-saving HIV testing and treatment services. Yet, few indicators of the HIV epidemic are measured at a level of disaggregation that allows to identify which vulnerable groups and geographies are being missed. In close collaboration with the UNAIDS Reference Group on Estimates, Modeling, and Projections, my postdoctoral research project aims at closing this gap to reduce inequality in the global HIV response. 

We will first conduct a systematic review of the literature on inequalities in HIV testing and treatment outcomes to identify the best summary measures to be used to quantify inequalities. We will then build upon modeling tools developed by our research team to capture heterogeneity in testing rates by available testing modalities (testing by a health professional in a facility or at home vs. self-testing), and produce estimates of HIV awareness of status, a key gateway to HIV treatment, at the subnational level. Finally, we will apply our new framework and updated model to estimate inequalities in HIV testing and treatment services along socio-demographic dimensions and geographies, in sub-Saharan Africa, to identify the vulnerable groups and geographies left behind in the progress towards ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic.

New tools are required to identify and resolve inequalities across the HIV care cascade, globally. Local estimates of HIV knowledge of status, disaggregated by vulnerable groups, are such a tool, providing means to target resources more efficiently."
The relationship between gender inequity and maternal mortality,"['Almeida, Nisha D']",['N/A'],"['Gender Epidemiology', 'Maternal And Child Health', 'Social Determinants']",105000.0,206066,"Background: Over half a million women continue to die each year from pregnancy and childbirth-related causes. The slow progress in reducing maternal deaths could be attributed to the myriad and complex causes of maternal mortality. Socioeconomic and cultural issues that confer secondary status on women may also hinder them from obtaining essential obstetrical care. When women consistently lag behind men in areas such as education, employment and political participation, a gender gap is created, which can affect the health of women. 
Objective: We hypothesize that the lower the status of women in a country, or the greater the gender gap, the higher the maternal mortality rate for that country. Consequently, the objectives of our study were to evaluate whether the existence of a gender gap is associated with maternal mortality in 130 countries.
Methods: We propose to conduct an ecological cross-sectional study using measures of gender inequity obtained from the World Economic Forum gender gap report. The gender gap index created will incorporate female economic and political participation, education and health, as compared to men. Poisson regression analyses will be used to assess the relationship between the gender gap index and maternal mortality. Longitudinal analyses will also be performed to examine whether maternal mortality decreases with reductions in gender inequity. 
Relevance: This study will be relevant to public health organisations and policy-makers in order to target the specific spheres where women lag behind men. Reducing maternal mortality and improving the general health of women will have greater implications on the health of their children and the productivity of society in general."
Examining the Association between Area Level Deprivation and Severity of Vehicle Collisions,"['Alphonsus, Khrisha']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,347087,"Motor vehicle collisions are one of the primary cause of disability and death worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that about 1.24 million people die each year due to traffic collisions. The objective of this study was to examine the association between area level deprivation and severity of vehicle collisions. As a secondary objective we examined interactions between area level socioeconomic status and urban form features (road conditions, posted speed limit, and traffic volume).  A multilevel observational study was conducted using data from 2000 to 2010 using the Saskatchewan Traffic Accident Information System (TAIS) for Saskatoon. We analyzed 72,234 collisions occurring in 337 dissemination areas (DA). The outcome variable was collision severity categorized as either property damage or injury/fatal collision. The Pampalon deprivation index is calculated for each DA using census data and was the primary exposure. Additional variables of interest included, light condition, vehicle type, road condition, road surface condition, speed, seasons, traffic volume, road type, and total precipitation. Approximately 11% of the variation in the severity of the collision was explained by area level deprivation in Saskatoon. The odds of an injury or fatal collision occurring in the most deprived areas was 1.6 (95% CI 1.2 to 2.2) times greater compared to the least deprived area. Our study showed a significant association between area level SES and severity of traffic collisions. The results of this study are consistent with past research and contribute to an emerging literature demonstrating that area level deprivation is associated with collisions. Improving poor road conditions, enhancing the number of street lights on roads, and reducing traffic volume could improve road safety in deprived areas."

Today, most of those injuries involve alcohol and/or drugs. More youth than ever before are driving under the influence of cannabis, more so than alcohol. Decades of educational campaigns have slightly decreased the number of young Canadians who die as a result of driving under the influence of alcohol, yet driving high is on the rise. But why? What makes a young driver decide to get behind the wheel? This Canada-wide project will partner with young Canadians to investigate the factors that influence their decision to drive high. Through a nation-wide survey, we will explore whether factors such as education, income, knowledge of the law, and credibility of the law among others, influence youth's decision to drive high. We will also interview youth across the country and discuss their experiences, what they know about driving high, and whether it influences how they act behind the wheel. This project will leverage the combined expertise of researchers across Canada, with collaboration from stakeholders including youth leaders, representatives from provincial injury prevention centres, public health agencies and regional injury prevention networks. Considering the health and safety implications for Canadian youth, this time-sensitive research will inform the development of future interventions and subsequent secondary data analyses to build in-country cannabis- related research capacity that can promote safe and responsible use of Cannabis. The voices of youth are needed. The cost, human lives, is unacceptable. We can and must prevent it."

This may lead to several complications including heart attacks, strokes, kidney damage, vision loss, and loss of limb. The rates of diabetes are rising globally and in Canada. With more advanced diagnostic tests we are now able to identify people with prediabetes and mild stages of diabetes. However, it is not clear if treating people with prediabetes and mild diabetes with  medications reduces their risk of worse outcomes related to diabetes. It is important to know if treating people with prediabetes and mild diabetes helps them avoid the complications of diabetes, or exposes them to more medication side-effects and psychological harms associated with over-diagnosis. 

In this study we propose to understand better how people with prediabetes and mild diabetes should be treated. We will interview people with lived experience of prediabetes and mild diabetes, and health care providers to understand how the diagnosis is made, managed, and the impacts of the diagnosis and associated additional monitoring. We will use data sets from Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario to identify newly diagnosed adult individuals with prediabetes and mild diabetes and evaluate their health outcomes over the course of seven years. We will seek to understand how those outcomes were impacted or not by the initiation of  medications.  

The findings from our study will shed light on an important question facing patients, health care providers and health systems. Prevention of diabetes related complications with early treatment is promising, however, there are risks of over-treating people with medications. Our study will help inform decisions around initiation of treatment in this group of people. This will lead to the formation of a unique cohort of people that can be followed for longer-term outcomes"

The Influence of Psychosocial Stressors on Indicators of Cardiometabolic Risk in the Transition to Young Adulthood,"['Ames, Megan E']",['N/A'],"['Adolescence', 'Cardiometabolic Risk', 'Internalizing Symptoms', 'Interpersonal Stress', 'Longitudinal', 'Young Adulthood']",90000.0,338910,"Adolescence and young adulthood are critical periods for disease prevention. Indicators of cardiometabolic risk (CMR) already show predictive variability in adolescence and the early identification and implementation of healthcare strategies can have significant long-term health benefits. CMR refers to a set of indicators that increase an individual's risk for diabetes, heart disease, or stroke (i.e., body mass index [BMI], systolic and diastolic blood pressure [BP], and waist circumference). Much of what we know about CMR comes from studies with adults and research focusing on younger age groups is needed. For the proposed research, data from the Victoria Healthy Youth Survey (V-HYS) will be used to describe the number of young adults (ages 22 to 29) exceeding established cut-offs for non-invasive CMR indicators. In addition, psychosocial factors may contribute to these risks and may also contribute to the effectiveness of prevention programs beyond individual-level health behaviours such as diet and exercise. However, these are rarely studied. Thus, how stress (i.e., depressive and anxiety symptoms and interpersonal problems) effect CMR across the transition to young adulthood will be examined. To add, gender differences will be investigated. The V-HYS is a six-wave, 10-year longitudinal study that surveyed youth (Time 1 N = 662; ages 12 to 18) biannually from 2003 to 2014. In-person measurements of CMR (BMI, systolic and diastolic BP, waist circumference) were collected in wave 6. Measurements of internalizing symptoms and interpersonal stress were collected at each wave. Findings will provide important information about the health of Canadian youth as well as identify new targets for the prevention of CMR. The results will also inform guidelines for early identification and preventative healthcare."

PH scholars, practitioners, and decision-makers from across the globe are now calling for a rebuilding of and reinvestment in PH systems for the COVID recovery period. However, there are substantial discrepancies between levels of governments or health reporting agencies as to how much is spent on PH. Without precise estimates of the past and current PH investments, rebuilding strong PH systems will prove difficult.
We propose a project dedicated to improving the PH financing/spending monitoring and reporting in Canada, with international implications and organized around three interrelated objectives. First, we will take an international and comparative approach to examine what spending is counted as PH or as healthcare in national accounts in Australia, Canada, and England, at the national, provincial/state, and local levels when relevant. Second, we will use findings from objective 1 and a systematic consensus building research methods with international and national experts to create a system of PH-specific accounts covering a validated list of PH spending items. Third, equipped with this new system, we will recreate and make available PH spending data in all Canadian provinces and territories from 2000 and onwards. Knowledge users who are PH decision-makers will be involved throughout the research continuum.
Overall, results from this research program will directly improve the health finance systems and offer needed evidence to guide the allocation of health resources, especially between healthcare and public health. These findings will ensure that public health spending efforts are precisely reported and monitored and will inform the post-COVID investments in PH systems. By allowing better monitoring of PH spending, this project will safeguard the sustainability of PH systems, and in turn help improve population health."
Spatial epidemiology of child and youth injury in Canada,"['Amram, Ofer']",['N/A'],"['Epidemiology', 'Gis', 'Health', 'Health Geography', 'Injury', 'Public Health', 'Trauma']",105000.0,283872,"Centering on the social and environmental determinants of childhood injury, this study will examine both the geographical distribution of major traumas within the Canadian child and youth population, and the effectiveness of Canadian pediatric trauma systems.
Approximately 25,000 Canadian children are hospitalized each year as a result of unintentional injuries.  Of these, approximately 400 will die.  The rate of injury and death amongst Canadian Aboriginal youth is even higher.  While the cost of these injuries is significant - estimated at 5.1$ billion annually - to date, very few studies have focused on the effectiveness of Canadian pediatric trauma systems. This project aims to address these issues and identify gaps in the delivery of pediatric trauma care by  mapping the hotspots for child and youth injury within Canada, identifying disadvantaged populations and high risk injury mechanisms and patterns, determining the types of injury requiring high level care, and exploring the barriers that impede access to appropriate care.  Results from this project, together with those from a larger CIHR-funded project (the CIHR Team in Child and Youth Injury Prevention which forms part of the larger STAIR project), will provide decision makers with the ability to allocate and reallocate resources to appropriate groups based on evidence. The results will be provided to users via a web based dashboard which will enable users to interact and analyze the data using a graphic user interface.    
In summary, this project will analyze Canadian pediatric traumas in terms of the severity of injury, the identification of at risk populations and the provision of appropriate treatment. In so doing, the intention is to optimize the provision of care and delivery of services to target populations and to help direct scarce prevention-related public health resources so as to have the greatest impact on reducing pediatric injuries in Canada."

Our members include doctors, midwives, scientists, nurses, social scientists, and civic leaders.
     We aim to identify issues Moroccan women face and design better health care.  We argue that care for mothers and infants should start in community-a return to midwives and home care.  This is not the care women usually get, however--many low/middle income countries provide care to mothers and babies only at hospitals.  The hospital may be very far away, the family may decide whether the woman can go, and the medications may be expensive.  We shift the focus of medical thinking from hospital to community.
     To find out what women want from health care, the network includes Moroccan women and their civic organizations.  Many Moroccan women create non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to advocate for themselves and their villages.  To see how this works, we study two successful examples-two NGO-government health partnerships, including travel to a remote village in Zawiya, to meet with women's organizations and hear their concerns.     
     We hope to use the Moroccan example to teach Canadians how to be better partners in global health.  There is often a disconnect; Canadian researchers and the WHO may recommend medical actions that are difficult or impossible to put in practice in Morocco.  We seek new methods for communicating between international researchers and the local ground level. 
     Finally, this network will provide training for Canadian doctors, nurses, and midwives.  The network will sensitize them to the needs, experiences, and perspectives of immigrant populations and Muslim patients in Canada, especially Moroccan-Canadians."

Determinants of healthy aging in Labrador and implications for community-based services,"['Andersen, Andrea M']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2800.0,368445,"Introduction

Health determinants such as social support, food and water security, and the built environment play important roles in promoting seniors' health, and in delaying the onset and impact of diseases associated with aging. Social isolation has been shown to be an important factor for both physical and mental health among seniors. In Labrador and other northern regions, community interventions that promote social connectedness may also address overlapping concerns related to isolation, mobility, and food security.  

Methods

By examining the local context for aging in Labrador, Canada this project seeks to contribute policy-relevant knowledge to community planning. The objectives of this study are to understand how older adults and seniors perceive healthy aging, to explore factors that contribute to social connectedness, and identify potential local interventions. In the initial phase of this community-based, qualitative study, we engaged organizations that serve seniors including faith groups, health and social care programs, and local governments, to help develop relevant research questions. We then conducted semi-structured interviews with 23 participants aged 60 years and older in two Labrador communities.

Results 

Participants emphasized the important roles of both family and friends in meeting basic needs, and helping seniors continue to live at home. These relationships help facilitate involvement in food harvesting, and social and cultural events. Seniors also noted the benefits of accessible community space as an important factor in fostering social connections, and discussed the risks and value of programs developed by local service organizations.

Discussion

These results underscore the value of informal and multigenerational social networks for healthy aging, while also highlighting opportunities for local governments to support initiatives that may reduce isolation among seniors in a northern and rural context."

The research development focuses on gendered enculturation and its influence through parenting as a turnkey if not invariably positive intervention to reduce GBV. Key theoretical touchstones are enculturation and decolonization. 

The driving force is research use in partner communities of origin and related urban communities: Alexis Nakota Sioux and urban Nakota Sioux (Edmonton); Akwesasne and urban Mohawk (Ottawa and Toronto), Inuit living in Ottawa, and a subgroup of the Ottawa Latin American immigrant community. The Centre will generate proposals for in-depth research with and for each of these partner groups, training researchers from each group to play lead roles in the future research. 

The Centre will also build skills in partner groups and organizations to use the products of GBV prevention research in mental health programs with partners engaged from the outset.

Decolonizing childbirth with Nunavik Inuit women transferred to high-risk hospitals for childbirth: a co-designed pilot intervention,"['Andersson, Neil']","['Cockcroft, Anne', 'Vang, Zoua']","['Child Birth', 'Cultural Safety', 'Decolonization', 'Health Services', 'Indigenous Women', 'Maternal Health', 'Participatory Research']",100000.0,406939,"BACKGROUND
Inuit women in Canada carry a disproportionate burden of poor health, with higher rates of maternal mortality and negative birth outcomes. Some 14% of Inuit women in Nunavik (Inuit territory in Quebec) travel to tertiary southern hospitals for specialized obstetric care. Fly-out births are linked to adverse health outcomes for Inuit women, their families and communities. This participatory research supports culturally safe Inuit childbirth, and will co-design pilot interventions with Inuit stakeholders and their care providers, to inform the decolonization of obstetric care in Quebec tertiary hospitals. 
METHODS
The study engages three stakeholder groups: (i) Montreal-based Inuit women, their families and community members; (ii) Inuit residing in Nunavik and (iii) care providers and policy makers in Nunavik and Montreal. With each group, a series of group fuzzy cognitive mapping sessions will explore experiences with fly-out childbirth and perspectives of decolonization in obstetric care. Individual and household questionnaires will document the frequency of these findings. Stakeholders will co-design an intervention through deliberative dialogue and community meetings. Recommendations will be shared with obstetrical staff of a Montreal tertiary hospital. A follow-up survey will measure quantitative changes in birth outcomes, patient satisfaction, and decolonizing care practices. An integrated knowledge translation and exchange strategy engages stakeholders in cognitive mapping sessions, and co-design interventions in deliberative dialogue. 
DISCUSSION
Evacuation for childbirth aims to reduce health disparities faced by Inuit women, yet it is inadvertently associated with adverse health outcomes. Affirming Inuit values of childbirth and engaging Inuit voices in service delivery improvement can support culturally safe care. The protocol and instruments developed may have wider relevance for rural Inuit across Canada."
"Characterizing chemical pollution to support the establishment of healthier alternatives: Addressing pesticide contamination among the Cayambe Indigenous community, Ecuador","['Andrade Rivas, Federico']",['N/A'],"['Chemical Pollution', 'Environmental Health', 'Health Equity', 'Indigenous Communities Health', 'Pesticides Exposure', 'Planetary Health', 'Risk Perception']",150000.0,377320,"Global agricultural systems are now highly interconnected. Purchases made by people in high-income countries may have an impact on the wellbeing of marginalized communities elsewhere. Chemical pollution is one of the paths illustrating this connection, as growing demand for imported agricultural goods may increase the exposure to pesticides, and the risk of developing non-communicable diseases (NCDs), among populations in the proximity of agricultural crops. Ecuador is the world's third-largest flower exporter, an industry that relies heavily on pesticide use. About half of flower farms in Ecuador are located next to Indigenous Cayambe territory, and this community has been struggling for their health and food sovereignty. Cayambe people may be at higher risk of developing NCDs, due to weak pesticide risk management and inadequate access to health care in the region. Moreover, underlying factors, such as poor nutrition and compromised immune systems, increase the risk of developing NCDs when exposed to pesticides. Though this situation raises concerns, few studies address this issue in the region and in low-income countries. 
The Cayambe community has raised concerns about excessive pesticide use in the region and its local government is committed to reducing exposures. Based on a long-term collaboration with Universidad Andina Simón Bolivar, and Cayambe authorities, we have a unique opportunity of working together to disentangle major sources of pesticide contamination. We will measure levels of pesticide contamination in mothers and children,  risk perceptions of pesticide use, and health-related variables. Using maps generated by a drone, we will compare these variables with living and working places. This study will allow us to identify high risk areas of contamination and paths of exposure. It will also enable us to evaluate strategies to reduce environmental and human health degradation, and build healthier alternatives that could be applied to other settings."
Explorer l'impact de la pratique de la présence attentive (mindfulness) sur la réduction des pensées négatives répétitives chez les personnes proches aidantes de personnes vivant avec un trouble neurocognitif majeur : une approche transdiagnostique de la santé mentale et du bien-être psychologique,"['Andrianova, Anna']",['N/A'],"['Essai Randomisé Contrôlé', 'Fardeau Des Aidants', 'Interventions Psychosociales', 'Mindfulness', 'Méthodes Mixtes', 'Pensées Négatives Répétitives', 'Personnes Proches Aidantes', 'Pleine Conscience', 'Présence Attentive', 'Santé Mentale']",105000.0,475604,"Chaque année, 76 000 Canadiens reçoivent un diagnostic de trouble neurocognitif majeur (TNCM), dont la forme la plus courante (60% des cas) est la maladie d'Alzheimer. Environ 61% des personnes âgées atteintes de TNCM vivent à leur domicile et reçoivent l'aide d'une personne proche aidante. Prendre soin d'un être cher est une responsabilité complexe qui peut nécessiter une restructuration fondamentale de toutes les sphères de la vie de la personne proche aidante. Les enjeux vécus par les proches aidants, dans le cadre de leur rôle, sont l'angoisse et le stress (41%); la fatigue (36%), les problèmes de sommeil (25%) et la détérioration de l'état de santé physique (20%). Les principaux domaines de besoin des proches aidants sont : la santé émotionnelle (58%) et la santé physique (32%).
Un mécanisme important de médiation de la relation entre les circonstances de soins et la santé et le bien-être des proches aidants est le processus cognitif des pensées négatives répétitives (PNR), caractérisé par des pensées obsessionnelles portant sur le passé (ruminations) et sur l'avenir (soucis). Les PNR sont impliquées dans le développement de divers troubles mentaux, et sont corrélées à des mesures de mauvaise santé physique, et leur intensité est liée à un déclin de la cognition générale, aux biomarqueurs et aux facteurs de risque de la maladie d'Alzheimer.
L'intensité de ce processus néfaste est négativement corrélée avec la présence attentive, une faculté mentale qui permet de prêter attention aux expériences du moment présent sans porter de jugement et sans réagir. L'étude proposée examinera pour la première fois une intervention axée sur les PNR pour les proches aidants d'aînés vivant avec un TNCM. Cette intervention a le potentiel de constituer la base d'un service psychosocial innovant de surveillance et de réduction des PNR, disponible pour un large éventail d'utilisateurs, y compris les dyades personnes aidantes-personnes aidées, les professionnels et les intervenants."

However, an increasing body of evidence suggests that food insecurity and malnutrition may have a significant adverse impact on HIV patient treatment outcomes. Few studies have been conducted on this topic worldwide. In order to ensure that patient outcomes are optimized in Canada and internationally, there is an urgent need to understand the effect of food insecurity and malnutrition on HIV progression and mortality. The British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS (BC-CfE) is one of Canada's leading clinical, laboratory and epidemiological research centres. It manages the  procurement and distribution of anti-HIV drugs for all HIV-positive people in the province. The proposed research aims to assess the impact of food insecurity and malnutrition on survival, immunological status and virological change among patients receiving HIV treatment in BC. The research will draw upon the BC-CfE's expertise in molecular biology, clinical care, statistic and epidemiological analysis. It will be conducted in close collaboration with HIV-related community-based organizations. Findings from this study will be widely disseminated to academic audiences through publication in peer-reviewed journals; to clinical and policy audiences through publication in the BC-CfE's monthly newsletter; and to community groups through stakeholder meetings. Study findings from the proposed project will be relevant to public health managers and clinicians throughout Canada.

This topic has been identified as a key research priority by the Public Health Agency of Canada, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization (WHO). Drawing on United Nations climate data and novel technologies for automated disease outbreak detection (HealthMap), this study will explore the potential relationship between climate change and the global incidence of food-borne diseases, via three Aims:
Aim 1: Validate the use of infectious disease surveillance data sources for tracking spatiotemporal trends in global food-borne disease risk and burden. This study will assess the validity of the HealthMap outbreak detection system for accurately detecting the global burden of food-borne diseases; clarify biases inherent in the automated surveillance system; and enhance validity of subsequent model-building processes.
Aim 2: Build spatiotemporal models to estimate the effects of climate change on food-borne disease burden globally. Drawing on validated data from Aim 1, the study will identify food-borne diseases most sensitive to climate change, and build disease-specific predictive spatiotemporal models of the effects of climate on food-borne disease risk and burden.
Aim 3: Forecast potential effects of global climate change on select food-borne diseases. Using models developed in Aim 2 and climate change data, this study will evaluate the predicted change in the spatiotemporal dynamics of select food-borne diseases under different climate change scenarios.
Findings from this study will inform Health Canada's public health strategies aimed at preventing and mitigating the impacts of food-borne diseases. Globally, they will inform WHO food safety monitoring and evaluation strategies, enhancing global health security measures under the International Health Regulations."

Intergenerational impacts of Indian Residential Schools: Results from the 2007/08 First Nations Regional Longitudinal Health Survey,"['Anisman, Hymie']","['Bombay, Amy', 'Maggi, Stefania', 'Matheson, Kimberly']","['Aboriginal Health', 'Determinants Of Health', 'Indian Residential Schools', 'Intergenerational Trauma', 'Mental Health', 'Physical Health', 'Stress And Coping', 'Vulnerable Populations']",99679.0,231462,"From 1863 to 1996, as part of an effort of forced assimilation on the part of the Canadian government and several religious factions, Aboriginal children from across Canada were forced to leave their families to attend Indian Residential Schools (IRS). Many children in these schools experienced abuse, neglect, and were taught to be ashamed of their families and culture. In addition to reports of diminished health among those who attended, increased levels of distress have also been observed among children of IRS Survivors relative to First Nations adults whose families were not intimately impacted by this policy. Considering the large proportion of the First Nations population that has been impacted by IRSs, it is important to identify mechanisms by which the cycle of trauma and stress repeats itself across generations in order to intervene and preclude the intergenerational cycle.
Secondary analyses of data from the 2007/08 First Nations Regional Longitudinal Health Survey (RHS), the only national level survey assessing health indicators among First Nations living on-reserve, provides a unique opportunity to further explore the intergenerational impacts of IRSs. The proposed analyses will evaluate processes that underlie the relations between having a parent who attended IRS and various health outcomes, and will also explore potential resilience or vulnerability factors that may influence well-being in this population. Further evidence of such intergenerational impacts will emphasize the need for services aimed at promoting mental health among First Nations peoples to target the descendents of those who were victims of IRSs and similar policies. Furthermore, the findings will inform the development of evidence-based health interventions that may diminish the otherwise ongoing intergenerational effects of trauma among First Nations people, and in turn, contribute to reducing the health disparities that exist between First Nations peoples and the general population."

This research will explore the following questions: 1) How can we foster meaningful engagement with Indigenous patients and families as equal partners in research? 2) What is known about access to and outcomes of transplantation among Indigenous children? 3) How do transplantation rates and outcomes compare between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children? 4) What are the experiences and perspectives of Indigenous patients, families and knowledge users? And 5) How can we collaborate with knowledge users to create culturally safe tools to improve health outcomes in pediatric solid organ transplantation? Our study design will include four phases: 1) A scoping review to describe the international knowledge about access, survival and health outcomes of transplantation among Indigenous children; 2) A retrospective cohort study to compare transplantation rates and outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children in Canada; 3) Semi-structured Interviews with Indigenous transplant patients and families, and knowledge users to identify barriers and facilitators to transplant access and care; and 4) A knowledge sharing workshop with community partners and knowledge users. This research will focus on building strong partnerships with Indigenous patients and families to share power and research decision-making. Guided by their experiences and knowledge, this research will co-create new knowledge about transplantation rates and outcomes to inform measurable goals and interventions to improve health equity within pediatric transplantation."

Consequently, these individuals are at risk of poor health outcomes following prison release including stopping life-saving anti-HIV treatments, complications of HIV infection, and relapse of substance use. In addition, with poor linkage to HIV care and social support, formerly incarcerated persons with HIV rely on hospital emergency departments for their care.  Therefore, it is important that interventions be developed which promote access to these services for when these individuals are returning to the community.  Such interventions are more likely to be effective when informed by the experiences of formerly incarcerated persons living with HIV.  However, to date, no such studies have been conducted in Canada.  Working in partnership with the Prisoners With HIV/AIDS Support Action Network (PASAN) and other AIDS Service Organizations across Ontario, the goals of this project are to: 1) establish a research team of community members, knowledge users and researchers to conduct community- based research intended to optimize health outcomes of formerly incarcerated persons with HIV; 2) identify barriers to post-release linkage to HIV health and support services from the perspective of formerly incarcerated persons with HIV from across Ontario; and 3) host a knowledge translation and exchange seminar to discuss findings with participants, knowledge users and policy makers . This capacity-building study is part of a larger strategy to engage community members in identifying barriers to post-release linkage with HIV health and social support services (Phase I - current proposal), select, implement and pilot interventions to address barriers (Phase II), and evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions for facilitating post-release linkage with HIV health and social support services (Phase III)."

The main purpose of this project is to assemble a research collaborative of heterosexual men living with HIV, policy makers, representatives from AIDS service organizations (ASOs) and academic researchers in order to develop a research and policy agenda that is specific to the needs of this demographic.  A community advisory board (CAB) of five heterosexual men living with HIV has been involved in preliminary planning, and will be involved in the data generation, thematic analysis and presentation of findings from the summit to stakeholders and academics.  In this manner, the CAB and summit participants will adopt multiple roles in the pyramid of involvement outlined in the Greater Involvement of Persons Living with HIV/AIDS statement, including 'experts', 'speakers' and 'decision-makers'.  Therefore, the planning and execution of the meeting is notable for its significant degree of input by members of the target community, and represents a commitment on the part of the research team to build further research capacity in partnership with this group.  To our knowledge, our work with heterosexual men living with HIV represents the first concerted attempt to build research capacity with this group.  The contribution made by our proposal is therefore novel and will produce community-generated information that is highly relevant for decision makers, community workers and clinicians working with HIV-infected heterosexual men living with HIV."

The most vulnerable people, people with chronic conditions or in rural and remote areas with limited access to emergency services, bear most of the impact. There is an urgent need to understand and support community-grown adaptation taking place in rural and remote communities in Canada, as there is limited research on local solutions. My core objectives are to understand individuals' and communities' experiences of climate events, how their perception of vulnerability or resilience informs autonomous adaptation at the household or community level, and the types of solutions they believe will promote population health in a rapidly changing climate. This research will use mixed methods, including interviews, focus groups, photovoice, and choice experiments. Community members and community leaders will be able to share their perspectives and experiences. Photovoice, an arts-based method will provide people room for participants to not just tell but show their lived experiences through pictures. Interview and focus group data will be analyzed thematically, photovoice data will be analyzed in collaboration with participants through a meaning-making exercise. Choice experiments will be used to explore the preferences of people on the best ways to promote population health in a changing climate, data will be analyzed using conditional logit models in STATA. This work will highlight areas where policymakers in health authorities and ministries of health can provide funding and support or scale up community-grown adaptation efforts. It will also provide insight into public preferences for interventions aimed at ensuring environmentally sustainable improvements in population health."

The built environment is the infrastructure and its layout made by humans such as urban green spaces, road networks, and residential and commercial establishments, and there is a growing interest in studying its effect on health, including the risk of cancer. Built infrastructure, such as recreational spaces and walking paths, have resulted in increased physical activity promoting a healthier lifestyle. However, improved infrastructure with increased road connectivity, sidewalk completeness, and access to parks could be associated with increased population density and accompanying negative consequences such as increased pollution levels. Environmental exposures such as air pollution, the extent of greenness and ambient light at night, and modifiable lifestyle factors such as physical activity, diet, smoking, and alcohol intake have been shown to influence the risk of cancer.
These environmental and lifestyle factors also affect the levels of metabolites, which are small-molecule biochemicals, such as proteins, in the human body. Metabolites are closely related to disease characteristics and are routinely used for diagnosis, studying disease processes, and discovering disease pathways, including those related to cancer.

The study aims to combine data from the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow's Health (CanPath), the Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research Consortium (CANUE), and the Where Matters: Health & Economic Benefits Study to investigate the combined effect of the built environment and lifestyle factors on the risk of breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers in British Columbia and Alberta. In addition, to improve our understanding of how the built environment influences health, the study will use previously generated biochemical data in British Columbia to uncover metabolites associated with various aspects of the built environment."

However, when the relevant research pertains to youth, researchers will need to use more innovative methods than scientific reports to get their attention. Although it may not be necessary or sufficient, recent research suggests that marijuana use three times a week for three months or longer during the teenage years is a significant risk factor for the development of psychosis among vulnerable youth. We propose to raise awareness of this little known risk factor. 
This project translates and disseminates this research knowledge about marijuana use, psychosis, and early intervention by using a youth friendly medium - an animated video game/app. As a communication strategy, interactive gaming technology has the potential to be more appealing and accessible to youth than mainstream educational activities. The game will be designed by game developers, who will work collaboratively with the co-applicants to better appreciate the research findings and to integrate the knowledge into the game. The inspiration will come from stories that emerge out of two qualitative studies containing descriptions of real life and first-time experiences with marijuana use, psychosis, and the healthcare system. The game will then be disseminated at a forum for youth and youth leaders in order to foster an action plan to market the game online to youth, particularly those who are weekly marijuana users. The game/app will have the potential to disseminate this research knowledge, possibly increasing awareness of this modifiable risk factor for psychosis and reducing the risk of psychosis among vulnerable youth."

"HIV and Socio-Structural Predictors of Initiating Crystal Methamphetamine Injection among Sex Workers in Vancouver, Canada","['Argento, Elena']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2500.0,347115,"Crystal methamphetamine has become one of the most commonly used illicit drugs worldwide, with significant potential for addiction and transmission of HIV and other blood-borne infections. Despite the wide range of social and health-related harms associated with injection drug use, risk factors for injecting crystal methamphetamine remain understudied and poorly understood. This study therefore aimed to investigate risk factors for initiating crystal methamphetamine injection among women sex workers in Vancouver, Canada. Sex workers were invited to participate through outreach to outdoor locations and hidden indoor and online venues across Metro Vancouver and completed bi-annual interviewer-administered questionnaires and HIV/STI (sexually transmitted infection) testing by a project nurse between 2010 and 2013. This study used Cox regression analyses to identify predictors of initiating crystal methamphetamine injection over three years follow-up. The following risk factors were found to be significantly associated with first time injection of crystal methamphetamine among sex workers: injection heroin use, occupational violence, being HIV positive, and a history of childhood abuse. The study findings underscore the urgent need for integrated violence and HIV prevention efforts in mitigating the risk for initiating injection drug use and for novel, evidence-based addictions treatment tailored specifically for sex workers."
Preventing Sexually Transmitted and Blood Borne Infections (STBBIs) among Sex Workers: A Review of the Evidence on Determinants and Interventions in High-Income Countries,"['Argento, Elena']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2500.0,368209,"Objective: Sex workers continue to face a disproportionate burden of HIV and other sexually transmitted and blood borne infections (STBBIs). This review aims to provide a comprehensive synthesis of global research on determinants of STBBIs and promising intervention practices for sex workers of all genders in high-income countries. 

Methods: We searched for publications over the last decade (January 2005-March 2016) among women, men, and trans sex workers. Data obtained from quantitative peer-reviewed studies were triangulated with publicly available reports and qualitative/ethnographic research where quantitative evidence was limited. 

Results: Research consistently demonstrates the direct and indirect impacts of structural factors (e.g., violence, stigma, criminalization) on increasing STBBI risk for sex workers, further compounded by individual and interpersonal factors (e.g., substance use, unprotected sex). Sub-optimal access to health and prevention services remains concerning. Full decriminalization of sex work has been shown to have the largest potential to avert new infections in sex work, through reducing workplace violence and increasing access to safer workspaces. 

Conclusions: The high burden of STBBIs among sex workers across high-income settings is of major concern. Multi-pronged structural and community-led approaches are paramount to addressing STBBI risk and are necessary to realizing health and human rights for sex workers."
Correlates of suicidality among a community-based cohort of women sex workers: The protective effect of social cohesion,"['Argento, Elena']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2650.0,391549,"Background: Suicide is a critical public concern globally. Sex workers experience disproportionately elevated risks and rates of morbidity and mortality, yet empirical research on suicide risk among marginalized women is limited. This study therefore aimed to longitudinally investigate the burden and socio-structural correlates of suicidality among women sex workers in Vancouver, Canada. 

Methods: Data (2010-2017) were drawn from a community-based, prospective cohort of women sex workers known as AESHA (An Evaluation of Sex Workers Health Access). Participants completed biannual interviewer-administered questionnaires and correlates of suicidality (suicide attempts or ideation) in the last six months were analyzed using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression with generalized estimating equations (GEE). 

Results: Of a total 867 participants at baseline, 16% (n=141) reported suicidality in the last six months, and 29% reported suicidality at some point during the study; 38% of women identified as Indigenous. In final multivariable analysis, the following factors were independently associated with suicidality: physical and/or sexual childhood abuse, mental health issues (depression/anxiety/post-traumatic stress disorder), intimate partner violence, physical and/or sexual violence by clients, and homelessness. Older age and higher social cohesion among women were significantly associated with reduced risk of suicide. 

Conclusions: These findings reveal key socio-structural correlates of suicidality among women sex workers, including past trauma, partner violence, and homelessness. Strengthening social cohesion among sex workers may have a protective effect on suicidality. Trauma-informed and community-led structural interventions tailored to women sex workers are urgently needed alongside a legal framework that enables collectivization and connectedness."
Waning Measles Immunity in Ontario: A Population-Based Cohort Study,"['Ariyarajah, Archchun']",['N/A'],"['Antibody Testing', 'Health Administrative Data', 'Infectious Disease Epidemiology', 'Measles', 'Population-Level Immunity']",105000.0,439330,"Immunity derived from the measles vaccine has been shown to decrease over time in countries where measles has been eliminated. This phenomenon is called waning immunity. Canada eliminated measles in 1998 and with increasing measles cases reported globally, waning immunity puts Canada at risk for future outbreaks. Although children are recommended to be vaccinated at 12 months of age, vaccination at older age has been associated with higher long-term immunity. This has been shown in Canada through studies resulting from measles outbreaks, albeit with small sample sizes. We aim to use a large population-based cohort study to examine the effect of age at and time since first dose of measles vaccine on measles immunity using antibody test results from Public Health Ontario (PHO) linked to health administrative data from 2010 to 2019. Results from this study may inform changes to the measles vaccine schedule to optimize measles immunity and ensure that future generations maintain measles elimination status."

In spite of this, almost all studies looking at sexual risk and substance use over time group gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men together, regardless of their sexual orientation. This is problematic because bisexual men have different health needs and face different challenges because of their sexual orientation. This study aims to examine patterns of sexual risk, substance use, and associated characteristics (for example: age, income, mental health, and social support) over the course of four years in a large sample of bisexual men in Vancouver, BC. Additionally, we seek to determine the population-estimates and prevalence of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections in this population. Finally, we will compare sexual risk, substance use, and associated characteristics among bisexual men in Vancouver to a similar sample of exclusively gay men to identify meaningful differences to inform treatment and prevention programs. This research is important because bisexual men are often over looked in ""gay men's health research"" - a catch-all phrase used to describe research among all men who have sex with men. As a result, we do not fully understand the needs of this community. Working in partnership with members of the community and community-based organizations, we will use the results of this study to increase awareness and acceptance of bisexual men within the LGBT community, inform policy and prevention activities, and increase outreach to bisexual individuals. This work will increase the scientific understanding of bisexual men's health needs and will enable service providers and health care specialists to better serve the needs of this marginalized population in BC and across Canada."

Estimating the causal effect of paid sick leave on health status and healthcare utilization: Implications for the design of equity-focused policy interventions,"['Arneja, Jasleen']",['N/A'],"['Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Policy Evaluation', 'Population Health', 'Social Determinants Of Health', 'Social Epidemiology']",150000.0,457460,"Social policies target the root causes underlying health inequalities to improve population-level health. One such policy-paid sick leave-allows workers to take time off from work when sick, without worrying about losing wages. In the United States, 20 million people go to work sick every year because they lack access to paid sick leave. While the labour market impacts of paid sick leave reforms are well-documented, surprisingly few studies have examined how paid sick leave policies affect population-level health.

Changes to paid sick leave policies can act as natural experiments and provide a unique opportunity to study the causal effects of policies on health outcomes. For my proposed research, I will use a database of systematically catalogued paid sick leave policies from 193 countries.  I will study how the introduction of a paid sick leave policy affects the type of healthcare services individuals use, and whether and to what extent it impacts the health of people in that country. I will also examine the design of the policies themselves, to determine which features improve health outcomes and reduce inequalities in health. I will examine policy characteristics such as the number of days of leave available, the percentage of wages the policy replaces, and whether the policy is implemented through the employer or the government. Lastly, I will examine how individual-level uptake of paid leave policies impacts healthcare service use and health outcomes.

Evidence on the health impacts of paid sick leave is severely lacking. This study will contribute rigorous, cross-national evidence on the impact of paid sick leave on healthcare service use and health status, with significant potential to guide policy interventions to improve health equity. In a world with limited resources, the efficient use and allocation of healthcare resources is a priority. Thus, upstream actions that target the root causes of preventable negative health outcomes is of great importance."

This is one of first studies to provide a visual scanning analysis of emotional face processing under fixed-duration and speeded conditions (i.e., common experimental conditions & those more similar to outside the lab, respectively).  It controls for variables unrelated to visual scanning that are known to affect task difficulty following brain injury (e.g, motor & memory demands) so that the effect of visual scanning can be examined in detail. Therefore, the results form this initial treatment-development study on typically developing individuals will be invaluable to a future brain-injury subproject. Moreover, they have significant implications for those with neurodevelopmental conditions, typically developing young people, & older adults."

Understanding its epidemiologic characteristics via serology (e.g. blood tests that measure the level of antibodies) is key to producing accurate estimates of future animal-human transmission and in turn, implementing public health measures to prevent this risk of ""spillover"". Barriers to this understanding, however, include the lack of unified and timely serology data, as well as limited awareness of population immunity. To address these barriers, an innovative and continuously updated synthesis and analysis of MERS seroprevalence will be conducted, which will include both academic and non-academic sources. The results will also be visualized on an interactive data web platform. This unique and streamlined approach will in turn inform estimates of MERS prevalence, possible cross-immunity from prior infection/vaccination against COVID-19, and spillover risk, thus facilitating vital insights for use by policy, research and clinical decision-makers in an era of pandemic preparedness. The culmination of this MERS case study will centralize access to MERS serology data, illustrate the feasibility and structure of a unified serosurveillance system,  and highlight the design of a tailored data platform for pandemic preparedness. Ultimately, these efforts will build crucial capacity to monitor coronaviruses and other emerging infectious disease threats on a global scale."

"Combining contact lens sensors, metabolomics and artificial intelligence to characterize exposure and breast cancer biomarkers","['Arrandale, Victoria H']","['Demers, Paul A', 'Harris, Shelley A', 'Wishart, David S']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Breast Cancer', 'Contact Lenses', 'Environmental Exposures', 'Metabolomics', 'Passive Sampling', 'Wearable Sensors']",149720.0,436943,"Background 
Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women and risks are multi-factorial. Approximately 10% of a woman's risk of breast cancer can be explained by genetics. The remaining 90% of risk is explained by reproductive and environmental factors such hormonal changes, diet, infections, and chemical exposures. To evaluate risk factors and prevent breast cancer, we need new techniques to help us measure important environmental exposures and more efficiently detect cancers early.

Goal of project 
We aim to develop non-invasive methods to measure environmental exposures as well as detect early biomarkers of cancer. Our study will combine the use of contact lenses, metabolomic analysis and artificial intelligence (AI) and answer the following:

1. Can contact lenses and metabolomics be used to measure environmental chemicals in our body?
1. Can contact lenses, metabolomics and AI be used to identify women who have breast cancer? 

Project description
In this pilot study, we will recruit two groups of women between the ages of 19-50 from the CanPath Ontario cohort (Ontario Health Study) who wear contact lenses: 30 who have been diagnosed with breast cancer and 30 who have not. Following participant consent, we will mail prescription contact lenses to the women who will then wear a pair daily for three days and mail them back. We will test the contact lenses for chemicals they absorbed and biomarkers of interest and analyze the results using computer models.  

Future impact
One in two Canadians will have cancer in their lifetime and most of these cancers are preventable.  If our study works well, it will provide support for repurposing commercially available contact lenses, along with the use of metabolomics and AI to measure environmental exposures and detect early signs of breast cancer. The tools are inexpensive and easy-to-use and can be modified and applied to other types of cancers affecting Canadians."
"Health inequalities among people diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculosis in Manitoba: Missed opportunities in the access to testing, treatment, and linkage to care","['Arroyave, Luisa']",['N/A'],"['Epidemiology', 'Health Inequalities', 'Hiv', 'Ics Travel Awards', 'Tuberculosis']",3000.0,495202,"In all countries, no matter their income, there are wide disparities in the health status of different population groups. According to the Key Health Inequalities in Canada report, socio-economic contexts were associated with different health outcomes, showing significant health inequalities for those with lower socioeconomic status, Indigenous peoples, sexual and ethnic minorities, and immigrants. This is the case of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis (TB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which have a disproportionate burden on people who are most disadvantaged. In 2020, there were 1,639 new persons diagnosed with HIV, with higher proportions in males, people who inject drugs and people from the Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Quebec provinces. Related to TB, there were 1,772 cases of active TB reported in Canada in 2020, with higher proportions among foreign-born individuals and Indigenous Peoples. This study aims to identify the missed opportunities and health inequalities in the access to testing, treatment, and linkage to care in HIV and TB cases through Manitoba regions using data already collected from the Manitoba Population Research Data Repository. With this study, we will be able to address the burden of the diseases, detection, prevention, and treatment, as well as to investigate health inequalities to understand those barriers to achieving goals and targets in HIV and TB programs which disproportionately impact underserved populations. Although public health organizations understand the need for ""health equity"", there are few up-to-date examples of how to use data to look for health inequalities, signaling where inequities can be reduced. Therefore, it is necessary to describe the relevance of measuring and monitoring health inequalities and to illustrate their applicability using data routinely collected to help investigate socioeconomic inequalities and the impact of specific interventions implemented by governments and policymakers."

It is characterized by abdominal cramps, pain, fever, and watery, sometimes bloody, diarrhea. It is the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in Canada. It is estimated that up to 300,000 Canadians are infected by Campylobacter annually. Some of them will develop severe lifelong sequelae. In addition, this infectious disease generates high costs to the food industry through quality controls and to society through medical costs and productivity losses. Campylobacteriosis is seasonal; it occurs predominantly in summer for unclear reasons. Environmental factors, agricultural activities and human behaviours are likely contributors to the seasonal increase of campylobacteriosis. In Canada, climate changes will lead to warmer, longer summers and milder, shorter winters. Current seasonality of campylobacteriosis strongly suggests that its peak will be amplified over the next decades along with climate change and last longer, thus increasing the number of people infected. The objective of this project is to develop a mathematical model to predict campylobacteriosis long-term temporal trends in Canada. Once developed, our model could be used to implement effective prevention and intervention programs and strategies."
Examining the impact of contacts with healthcare and harm-reduction services on the injection trajectories of people who inject drugs,"['Artenie, Andreea A']",['N/A'],"['Addiction', 'Epidemiology', 'Growth Mixture Modelling', 'Hepatitis C Virus', 'Hiv', 'Injection Drug Use', 'Trajectory']",105000.0,347963,"People who inject drugs (PWID) are at high risk of infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HCV). Previous research has suggested that the injection patterns of these individuals evolve differently over time, with some injecting persistently at high, moderate and low frequency and others having patterns of injection that are changing (decreasing, fluctuating). Yet, it is unclear whether PWID who have specific trajectories of injection are more likely to become infected with HIV or HCV than others. In addition, whether contacts with healthcare and harm reduction services can lead to subsequent decreases in PWID's courses of injection has not been previously examined. Using over 20-years of data collected from a community-based study of PWID in Montreal (1992- ), our study has three aims: 1) to examine whether there are sub-groups of PWID who have distinct courses of injection frequency over time, 2) to compare the risk of HIV and HCV infection among sub-groups, and 3) to examine whether contacts with healthcare and harm reduction services can lead to subsequent decreases in injection frequency within each sub-group. To be eligible for enrollment in the study, PWID must have injected drugs in the previous 6 months. At each semi-annual interview, they provide blood for HIV/HCV testing and information on their socio-demographic characteristics, injection drug use patterns (including their frequency of daily injection in the previous month and past 6 months), and contacts with healthcare (primary, addiction and psychiatric) and harm reduction (needle exchange programs) services in the previous 6 months. A total of 4235 PWID have been enrolled in the study (3078 and 2549 completed 2 and 3 visits, respectively), and will be available for the analyses. Our findings have the potential to inform the development of HIV and HCV prevention strategies tailored to the individual injection trajectories of PWID."

How to allocate finite health care resources, and who has the most urgent need for health care, for example, are a few examples of value-related questions that jurisdictions at various levels, from districts to the federal government, routinely face. Some of the challenging questions that call for ethical judgments are related to health equity, a health policy goal endorsed by many jurisdictions, including Canada. Any efforts to achieve health equity must start by defining what is unfair about the fact that some people are healthy and others are not. An ethical judgment is also necessary to identify which health inequity demands societal interventions most urgently among the many we regrettably observe. 

Analytical ethics is a traditional approach to explore ethical questions related to health equity. It seeks answers through logic and rational thinking. Empirical ethics is an emerging approach that asks people about what they think of health equity. Both approaches are important and can complement health policy making. Yet, only recently, some researchers have begun to pay serious attention to the potential contribution of empirical ethics to health equity research and policy. 

This workshop aims to advance this emerging inquiry of empirical ethics in health equity research and policy by networking pioneers and discussing its importance, methods, and usefulness. The workshop is small, to encourage close and intensive exchange. It is interdisciplinary by inviting researchers with diverse backgrounds. It is international, gathering Canadian and international researchers and health policy leaders, for global relevance. The proposed workshop will make an important contribution to enhance citizen engagement in health equity research and policy."

Therefore, we propose to systematically search the published peer-reviewed and grey literature (e.g. technical reports, working papers etc.) to find information on the association between three main areas- seniors' physical mobility; the social environment; and the built environment (areas outside of the home). In addition, we propose a symposium to bring together key target groups (seniors, planners and health researchers) to give future direction in this area. We anticipate that our synthesis will be a framework for developing a seniors' specific lens on the contributing role of the built environment on the health of our aging population."

As immigrants, these children face barriers (e.g., language, location, discrimination) to health services, which contribute to their vulnerability to poor physical (under treatment, pain, fitness) and psychosocial (stress, depression, exclusion) health outcomes. With rising immigration rates and the increasing prevalence of pediatric health needs, it is critical to understand the health and rehabilitation needs of disabled children in immigrant families. In response to this gap in knowledge, I will conduct an in-depth exploratory study on children with chronic physical conditions in immigrant families. My aims are to: 1) understand how children and parents manage and perceive disability, health and rehabilitation and 2) identify needs, barriers and solutions to optimal health and rehabilitation care.  
I will focus on South Asian families in this study, as they comprise the largest immigrant group in Toronto (12%). As a result of this work, I will formulate a conceptual framework and methodology for future health research with other immigrant populations. 
I will design and conduct a critical ethnographic study with 20 families (with children aged 10 to 14). Parents and children will participate in sessions using interactive digital and visual data collection methods. These methods produce multi-layered digital recordings that facilitate in-depth analysis. They also provide the basis to create Integrated Arts-based Knowledge Translation videos, which can be edited and framed by knowledge users for dissemination. Findings from this study have the potential to minimize barriers to optimal health and rehabilitation care, enhance client and family-centered care, and tailor rehabilitation and support strategies, ultimately improving physical and psychosocial health outcomes of disabled children and their families."

There are low risk or benign HPV genotypes that may cause oral and/or genital warts, and high-risk HPV types (HR) which may lead to cancer. People with HIV or HIV-positive partners are at the higher risk of HPV-caused cancer. We hypothesized that early diagnosis and treatment of precancerous lesions will reduce the burden of disease in people living with HIV/AIDS.
We aimed to examine the distribution of high risk (HR) HPV-types in HIV-positive adults in Atlantic Canada. We also investigate an association of those HPV types with  detected precancerous lesions and cancer, and with patients' demographics and risk factors such as unprotected sex, number of sexual partners, smoking and others. This study was designed for a 3-year period subsequent to the baseline screening.  Consented HIV-positive participants were required to complete a confidential questionnaire. Oral and anal swabs were obtained from all participants and cervical specimen from females. All specimens were tested for abnormalities at cell level and presence of HPV infection. 
The screening year analysis was based on 300 patients (92% males) from four Atlantic Provinces. The average age was 47 years. Total 77% of participants tested positive for HPV infection, of them 54% with multiple HPV types in one swab. Total 46 different HPV genotypes were detected, of which 39% were high-risk. The most often detected HR types were: 16, 52, 45, 51-and 18. The highest number of cytologic abnormalities was reported in anal specimens (26%). These changes were strongly associated with patients' high risk sexual behavior. The overall prevalence of high-risk genotypes during the screening year was 47%. All participants with abnormal changes were further investigated to confirm them. The histology analysis with the biopsy from abnormal area were performed. Some of the results demonstrated more severe changes and even cancer."

By early February there were over 40,000 confirmed cases in 25 countries, of which 2.5% have been fatal. The WHO declared the virus to be a public health emergency of international concern. COVID-19 is poised to become the next pandemic. For both epidemics and pandemics, psychological factors play a major role in the spread and containment of infection (e.g., non-adherence with hygiene guidelines) and in societally disruptive behaviour (e.g., infection-related discrimination, excessive fear and worry, overuse of healthcare resources); as such, psychological factors have important public health significance. The proposed studies are the first of a planned series of studies with the end goal of developing a rapid assessment system (assessment battery and online delivery platform) that can be used to assess, for any pandemic or major epidemic, infection-related excessive anxiety and xenophobia, and risk factors for these problems. To achieve this end goal, we will conduct three studies with a specific focus on COVID-19 using community samples. The goal of Study 1 will be to develop and validate measures of COVID-19-related anxiety and xenophobia (C-ANX, and C-XEN). In Study 2, these scales will be used to identify the correlates of C-ANX and C-XEN, which can then be used to identify the downstream impacts of these psychological reactions. Based on the findings of Studies 1 and 2, we will develop and evaluate an online public health assessment and information platform (Study 3) designed to reduce the risk of adverse psychological reactions to infectious outbreak. This platform would then be expanded to (a) monitor the psychological impact (as a public health problem) of a pandemic/epidemic, (b) identify people in need of psychological services, and (c) implement interventions for reducing infection-related xenophobia and excessive anxiety."

In addition, with a decrease in formal programs and an increase in informal supports through the community and the internet, there is a need to map the resources available to new mothers. In order to best support the health and well being of new mothers and their infants/families, we must obtain an updated understanding of their needs and their access to supports.

This research study will use a qualitative, multiple method approach to explore how new mothers identify and prioritize their own postpartum needs and where they go to access information and support within six months of giving birth. This study will use feminist poststructuralist methodology, discourse analysis as well as social network analysis and mapping to critically examine how new mothers across Nova Scotia access support. Findings from this study will provide a comprehensive mapping of formal and informal postpartum resources used by new mothers as well as direction for health care providers to better respond to the needs of new mothers. Results from this study will be shared with communities and organizations across and outside of Canada to enhance the well being and health outcomes for mothers, infants and families."
Building Community Capacity to Address Food Insecurity through Policy Change,"['Atkey, Kayla M']",['N/A'],"['Community', 'Food Insecurity', 'Health Promotion', 'Policy Advocacy']",17500.0,254448,"Many Canadian households struggle to access or afford a sufficient amount of safe and nutritious food each day. This is a public health concern because lack of access to fresh and healthy food has been associated with inadequate nutrition, increased chronic disease risk, and poor mental health. Typical approaches for addressing this issue tend to focus on community programs such as food banks, community kitchens, and community gardens. While these strategies have had some success, they do not address the root causes that give rise to hunger in Canada. There is a need to better understand the impact of community responses to hunger and to move towards more effective and coordinated approaches for tackling this issue. The development of healthy public policy, in particular, is a key strategy for improving health. Health promotion can play an important role in enhancing healthy food access and affordability by building the capacity of the community sector to encourage healthy public policy change. 
This study examines 1) key issues facing communities in relation to food access and affordability, 2) policy actions and opportunities for community members to advocate for healthy public policy to address these issues, and 3) how policy tools can increase community capacity to encourage healthy policy change. The first phase of the study will explore issues related to food access and affordability in Edmonton, Alberta, to identify opportunities for policy action. The second phase will involve working with community stakeholders to move through a policy change process based on the findings of phase one. Policy readiness tools will be employed to increase community capacity for healthy policy change and the benefits and limitations of this process will be explored. The aim of the study is to characterize effective strategies for healthy policy change to prevent hunger and improve healthy food access and affordability, a significant public health challenge in Canada."
The Impact of Falls and Fear of Falling on Mobility for Community-Dwelling Older Adults: An International Perspective,"['Auais, Mohammad']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,364740,"Falls and Fear of falling are common in old age. Although the adverse consequences of falls and FOF were studied extensively, most studies had some methodological problems and weaknesses. The International Mobility in Aging Study (IMIAS) is an international study over time to understand factors that influence mobility of community-dwelling senior citizens in five sites: Canada (Kingston & Saint-Hyacinthe), Albania (Tirana), Colombia (Manizales) and Brazil (Natal). Drawing on longitudinal data from IMIAS and using validated and standardized tools in all study sites, we will prepare a workshop at an international congress to provide an overview of recent research to improve our understanding of factors associated with falls and fear of falling at an old age in diverse locations, and investigate if fear of falling can independently lead to functional disability over time. The research findings that we will present have clinical and policy implications and could improve senior citizens' mobility and, ultimately, their integration and participation in local communities."
No place like home: Exploring social belonging for older immigrant Muslim women,"['Au, Alesia W']",['N/A'],"['Ageing', 'Community-Dwelling', 'Gender', 'Immigration', 'Muslim', 'Social Belonging']",769.0,476351,"Without a secure sense of social belonging, older adults can experience loneliness, isolation, and feel ostracized in the communities they live in (De Jong Gierveld et al., 2015). These exclusionary experiences are detrimental to their wellbeing as they encounter barriers towards cultivating meaningful relationships. Thus, the ability to feel a sense of belonging is an essential part of healthy ageing in a post-migratory context (Nielson et al., 2017). Immigrant Muslim older (IMO) women's experiences of belongingness have not been explored or identified in the literature. Their belongingness is by ageism, and by gender, race, and religious discrimination (Salma & Salami, 2020).

This qualitative descriptive study aimed to explore how immigrant Muslim older (IMO) women in Edmonton, Alberta cultivated social belonging. A thematic sub-analysis of photo-elicitation interview data was completed. Participants are community-dwelling older adult (55+) women who self-identify as Muslims. Participants have taken pictures of what they felt socially connected to, then were interviewed about these photos afterwards. The analysis was informed by an intersectional life course perspective.

The findings showcased the complexity of transnational connections, the impact of memories through the lifetime, and the importance of connectedness to who they identify as family.

This research is significant as it focuses on how IMO women can thrive in the communities they live in and what supports they need to experience a sense of belongingness as they age in Canada. This research informs nurses about equitable health outcomes and how belongingness is a shared responsibility between immigrants and the larger society."
Child Bicyclist Injuries and the Built Environment: A Case-Crossover Study,"['Aucoin, Janet F']",['N/A'],"['Active Transportation', 'Bicycle', 'Built Environment', 'Case-Crossover', 'Child Health', 'Injury', 'Injury Prevention', 'Motor Vehicle Collision', 'Physical Activity']",105000.0,439663,"Traffic related injuries are one of the leading causes of injury and death in Canadian children. Collisions involving vehicles and child bicyclists contribute significantly to these injuries and are a cause for concern for the safety of our children. While bicycling and other forms of active transportation improve the physical and mental health of children, there is a decline in participation in part due to the safety concerns of traffic related injury. Child bicyclists experience and interact with traffic and traffic infrastructure differently than adults, which can increase risk of injury. Strategies to prevent these injuries must continue to be explored by both government and non-government organizations across municipalities. By examining the traffic infrastructure/built environment and its link to injury risk in child bicyclists in multiple cities across Canada we can determine the relation between the built environment and child bicycling safety.
The case-crossover design of this study uses participants as their own controls and will be used to compare the location a child was injured to two other locations on their route where they were not injured (i.e., control locations). We will examine child bicyclist injury and the built environment through child interviews and site observations. Interviews will allow for additional understanding of the child's perspective of bicycling safety. Using these approaches will allow for us to determine the built environment features such as traffic infrastructure that influence child bicyclist safety and perceptions of safety."

Les résultats de différentes études nous amènent à penser que certaines caractéristiques du tissu musculaire sont probablement impliquées dans la détérioration de l'action de l'insuline en lien avec le vieillissement et ainsi le développement du diabète de type 2. Les parents de premier degré de personnes souffrant de diabète de type 2 (1st degree relatives of type2 diabetes; 1st DR of T2D) ont un niveau de risque pouvant aller jusqu'à 80% de développer cette maladie. Alors qu'ils sont encore en santé, ces sujets constituent un sous-groupe intéressant pour l'étude de la tolérance au glucose et de l'action de l'insuline. Il serait de très grand intérêt d'examiner les caractéristiques du tissu musculaire et du métabolisme des lipides en lien avec l'action de l'insuline chez ces individus. Ainsi, nous allons comparer les caractéristiques du tissu musculaire de 20 1st DR of T2D d'âge moyen à celles de 20 individus témoin (pairés pour le sexe, l'âge et l'indice de masse corporelle). Nous examinerons les facteurs clés associés à l'action de l'insuline ainsi qu'au risque de développer un diabète de type 2, cela afin de potentiellement établir un lien entre le tissu musculaire et le métabolisme du glucose. Cette étude permettra de préciser les mécanismes reliant le métabolisme du glucose et le tissu musculaire chez des personnes à risque.

When a mother presents with high blood pressure, doctors often intervene with early delivery to prevent death or serious illness of her newborn. However, the relationships between high blood pressure, prematurity and infant death are complex, and it is often difficult to determine if the death of a newborn is actually caused by the mother's high blood pressure, or by the consequences of prematurity. This information would help clinicians to better determine the extent to which high blood pressure and preterm birth contribute to poor health in newborns, in order to better inform doctors of the risks involved with these problems during pregnancy. Also problematic is that most forms of high blood pressure in pregnancy have not been monitored provincially or nationally so it is not known how common this problem is in Canada, or if it is a growing problem as it is in other countries (such as in the United States). Using Quebec hospitalization records, an excellent but underutilized source of data on pregnancies, this study will examine the relationships between blood pressure, prematurity and newborn health, including statistics on trends over time in vulnerable populations. Furthermore, we will use sophisticated statistical techniques than have recently been developed in the epidemiologic literature to ensure that high quality results are obtained. The end result will be a better understanding of the contribution of high blood pressure and prematurity to newborn survival, and if there have been concerning changes over time."

Unfortunately, the factors that influence these newborn health outcomes are not well understood, and it is hard to develop public health programs to prevent prematurity and low birth weight.  Some research shows that the socio-economic status of mothers, and of the places where they live, can influence a newborn's health.  However, the relationships in Canada are not clear and we hypothesize that maternal education may be an important contributor.  This study will look at how education - both of mothers and of neighbourhoods - is associated with prematurity and birth weight in Quebec.  We will determine how the relationships have changed over time, which is important as some research suggests that newborn health may be more strongly affected by under education today than it was in the past.  The study findings will help guide public health policy on education of women as a tool to improve newborn health."

In consequence, health may be affected and mortality may increase. It is important to identify populations more vulnerable to severe weather. Pregnant women, infants, and young children may be more susceptible to extreme temperatures because their bodies are undergoing physical changes that make them less capable of adapting to their environment. Surprisingly little is known on how weather impacts health in pregnant women, infants and children. It is important for researchers to identify how, and to what extent, maternal-child health is affected by extreme weather conditions, and to better inform the public through health advisories of the consequences of extreme weather on pregnant women and children. This research aims to examine how maternal-child health is affected by weather conditions, by answering these questions: 

(1) What is the relationship between extremely high temperature and maternal disease during pregnancy, such as high blood pressure and preterm delivery? 
(2) What is the relationship between high temperature and health problems in newborns and young children, including hospitalization and death?
(3) Are impacts of extreme weather greater for pregnant women and children living in poverty? 

We will use Quebec data on births, hospitalizations and deaths from 1981 to 2010, as well as meteorological data from Environment Canada, to answer these questions. We will use the newest research methodologies developed in epidemiology to ensure that statistical methods up to date. We expect this research to provide the public and health officials with information to guide prevention efforts during extreme weather events."

Some researchers have questioned whether medical treatments such as newborn phototherapy can lead to cancer later during childhood. Phototherapy consists of blue light in the visible spectrum, and is commonly applied to the skin of infants at birth. Phototherapy is used to reduce newborn jaundice, or yellow skin, so as to prevent brain disorders. Phototherapy is generally considered safe, but evidence suggests that it can affect the genetic material of cells. However, effects in human children have been under tested. In this study, we will examine if phototherapy at birth increases the chance that a newborn develops cancer later in childhood. We will use a large dataset containing all infants born in hospitals in Quebec, Canada. Many infants in Quebec receive phototherapy. We will identify infants who received phototherapy and compare them with infants who did not receive phototherapy. We will determine if infants who received phototherapy had a higher chance of developing cancer before they turned 10 years old. This project will help determine if phototherapy is safe in infancy, or if pediatricians should be more cautious in the use of phototherapy to reduce the chance of cancer in children."

Mental health conditions in mothers may affect the way they care for their children, increasing the risk of preventable health problems. More and more studies show that women with poor mental health have a greater risk of delivering preterm. Preterm birth, or birth before 37 weeks of pregnancy, increases a child's chance of having health problems later in life. However, it is not clear if poor mental health in mothers has a direct impact on childhood health, or if it interacts with preterm birth to increase the vulnerability of children to later health problems. This project aims to determine what maternal mental health problems could be targeted early in the lives of mothers to prevent future diseases in their children, especially if they were born preterm.

We will use a dataset containing hospital data for all newborns in Quebec, Canada between 2006 and 2016 and will track infants over time. We will identify mothers with mental health conditions before or during pregnancy. We will follow infants for up to 11 years after birth and identify those who were born preterm and those hospitalized later in childhood. We will determine the association of maternal mental health conditions with the risk of preterm birth and childhood diseases, and how preterm birth influences the relationship between maternal mental health problems and childhood diseases.

This project will generate new knowledge by identifying maternal mental health problems associated with preterm birth and later childhood diseases. We will find what mental health conditions could be targeted early in life to prevent later adverse outcomes in children. The data will help physicians improve their care of vulnerable mothers and infants, and will influence prevention and care guidelines."

However, the pandemic's impact on youth mental health remains unclear. Children are underrepresented in research, and most studies are based on self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress.

This project will determine how the pandemic affected major youth mental health problems in Quebec, including suicide attempt, drug overdose, eating disorders, and injuries due to child maltreatment. We will identify whether policies and practices such as curfews during the pandemic had an impact on these outcomes. We will also identify specific subgroups of children and adolescents that were more vulnerable during the pandemic.

To carry out this work, we will analyze all hospitalizations in children and adolescents under 20 years of age in Quebec, Canada before and during the pandemic. We will study suicide attempt, drug overdose, alcohol intoxication, eating disorders, and home injuries due to maltreatment. We will assess whether pandemic control measures, socioeconomic conditions, chronic diseases, and other characteristics of children influenced the pandemic's impact on youth mental health.

This project will measure the impact of COVID-19 on understudied mental health problems in children and adolescents, and will identify vulnerable groups in need of support during pandemic recovery and future public health crises. Quebec was the most severely affected province at the start of the pandemic. Quebec's experience can provide invaluable information to provinces that were less heavily affected or affected later in the pandemic. The findings will be disseminated to health authorities, policymakers, and healthcare professionals to guide priority setting and interventions for pandemic control in all of Canada."

However, we know little about the long-term consequences of eating disorders. This project aims to determine the long-term effects of eating disorders in Canadians and their children.

We will use a dataset containing hospital admissions for individuals in Quebec from 1989 to 2022. This data is excellent for identifying severe eating disorders that place a large burden on society. We will identify men, women, and patients of all genders who were admitted for eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. We will follow the patients over time to identify future hospitalizations for chronic problems such as kidney disease and digestive illnesses. We will also identify the children of women with eating disorders and follow them over time to assess their health outcomes during childhood. We will determine how eating disorders relate to long-term health outcomes and how maternal eating disorders impact illnesses in their children.

Eating disorders may become a larger problem in the future due to social media and the obesity epidemic. The COVID-19 pandemic led to an increase in eating disorders in youth. This project will uncover the long-term outcomes of eating disorders. The findings will help doctors improve their care of Canadians with eating disorders over the course of their lives."

These policies, often referred to as Targeted Regulation of Abortion Provider (TRAP) laws, impose non-essential, costly requirements on providers and facilities. TRAP laws simultaneously dissuade the establishment of new providers and impede the functioning of existing providers, thus promoting clinic closures. Restrictions on provider availability may therefore decrease abortions by directly limiting access to services. We use a difference-in-differences design to assess the causal impact of TRAP laws on state-level abortion rates from 1991-2011. This analysis provides new evidence on understanding the causes of the abortion decline in the US."

VTE is a form of cardiovascular condition that causes blood clots in deep veins (deep venous thrombosis) of the legs that sometimes travel to the lungs (pulmonary embolism) and prove life-threatening. Despite this, up to now, research has focused on determining the link between rheumatic disorders and more common types of cardiovascular disease that cause clots in the vessels of the brain (stroke) and the heart (heart attack).
To address this important gap, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the risk of VTE in patients with key rheumatic conditions, defined as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (including lupus, scleroderma, dermato-polymyositis, Sjogren's disease, and systemic vasculitides) for our study purposes. This will be achieved by using a unique health database from British Columbia to identify the number of cases who developed VTE events for the first time after the disease. This number will be compared with the number of new cases from the general population without these diseases. Given the current research, we hypothesize that rheumatic diseases will have an increased risk of VTE. In addition, we will test if some of the anti-rheumatic treatments protect against VTE. Our results have the potential to impact the care, decrease the disease burden and improve survival of patients with arthritis."

Disruption of infant gut microbiota has the potential to cause allergic disease later in childhood. We and others have found that antibiotic use, formula feeding and caesarean delivery can significantly alter the infant gut microbiota. These exposures are also important risk factors for allergy and asthma in children. The impact of antibiotic-mediated microbiota disturbance is poorly understood because infants receiving antibiotics are often excluded from studies, and the impact of 
other environmental factors (e.g. siblings, pets, daycare attendance) has not been widely studied.

My goal is to systematically investigate the impact of antibiotic use and environmental exposures on infant gut microbiota, and subsequent development of allergic disease.  I will employ the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) birth cohort study as a research platform. Environmental exposures and type of feeding will be obtained by parent questionnaire, and antibiotic use will be determined from provincial prescription records.  Microbiota profiles will be generated via genetic analysis of fecal samples, and allergic disease will be evaluated by skin prick test for common allergies, diagnosis of allergic eczema, and parent-reported wheeze.  Specialized statistical methods will be used to examine microbiota changes according to exposures, and to test their impact on subsequent development of allergic disease.
 
The incidence of allergic disease has increased dramatically in recent years, representing a significant global health and economic burden.  New evidence suggests that modifiable environmental exposures may be responsible, through their impact on the gut microbiota.  My proposed research aims to provide evidence for this ""microbiota hypothesis"", with the potential to impact clinical practice guidelines and prevention strategies."

This metabolic condition is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy. It is now recognized that this disease is a risk factor for cancer. 
While both type 2 diabetes and cancer are undoubtedly related to aging, few studies have focused on the elderly (>75 years), an age group that generates over a third of all cancer cases observed in the population. Indeed, major diabetes randomized controlled trials either excluded elderly patients or were highly skewed towards younger populations. Furthermore, data is emerging that anti-diabetic drugs may play an important role in this association. Several observational studies have associated sulfonylureas, one of the oldest and most widely used classes of drugs for type 2 diabetes, with an increased risk of cancer. However, such studies had important methodological shortcomings. Equally important, not at all sulfonylureas are believed to have the same carcinogenic effects. Glyburide, a popular second generation sulfonylurea, is believed to have the highest carcinogenic potential. To date, there are few studies reporting on the association between glyburide and cancer incidence, especially in the elderly. Thus, the objective of this study will be to determine whether glyburide is associated with an increased risk of cancer in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes. A cohort study will be conducted using the GPRD, a large primary care database from the UK. The study cohort will consist of over 18,000 patients using second generation sulfonylureas between 1988-2008, followed until the end of 2011. Given the important public health impact of both type 2 diabetes and cancer, and the increasing use of sulfonylureas such as glyburide, this large cohort study will provide the medical community with strong evidence on the long-term effects of this agent in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes"

As a result, the clinical and economic burden of these cancers is likely to increase in the foreseeable future. Recently, several laboratory studies have shown that beta-blockers, drugs used to treat hypertension and heart failure, may have strong anti-cancer properties. To date, the few studies that have investigated the association between the use of these drugs and cancer outcomes in patients with prostate and breast cancer have reported conflicting results. Such discrepancies are likely due to important methodological shortcomings. Nonetheless, there is a strong biological rationale to investigate the potential anti-tumour effect of these agents. Thus, the objective of this study will be to determine whether the use of beta-blockers is associated with a decreased risk of cancer-specific mortality in patients with prostate and breast cancer. This will be achieved by conducting two cohort studies (one for prostate and the other for breast cancer) by linking four large electronic databases from the United Kingdom (UK); the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, the Hospital Episode Statistics database, the UK Cancer Registry, and the UK Office of National Statistics. The study cohorts will consist of 5,500 men diagnosed with prostate cancer and 6,000 women diagnosed with breast cancer between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 2009 with follow-up until December 31, 2012. While beta-blockers appear to hold promise as novel treatments in patients with prostate and breast cancer, it is too premature at this stage to launch expensive and lengthy randomized controlled trials. Thus, using appropriate pharmacoepidemiologic methods, this study will provide the medical strong evidence on the long-term effects of these agents in patients with these cancers."

These drugs have been shown to decrease the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular outcomes (such as heart attacks, strokes and death) in patients with type 2 diabetes in clinical trials. Despite their remarkable benefits, there have been concerns that these drugs might increase the risk of important adverse events including bladder cancer. To date, however, no studies have been conducted in the real-world setting to assess this possible association. To address this concern, we will conduct a large, international, multi-centre population-based cohort study using five administrative, primary care, and insurance databases from Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. At each site, we will compare new users of SGLT-2 inhibitors with new users of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, a class of drugs used at a similar stage of diabetes severity. The results from each site will then be pooled together for an overall estimate of the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitors on bladder cancer. As patients with type 2 diabetes are already at an increased risk of bladder cancer, this large international study will provide concerned stakeholders with much needed information on the safety profile of these drugs in a timely and cost-effective fashion."

It is particularly severe in patients with type 2 diabetes, who often develop complications such as cirrhosis, hepatic failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, currently, there are no approved treatments for NAFLD. Randomized controlled trials have shown that drugs commonly used in type 2 diabetes, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, reduce fat accumulation in the liver. However, whether they reduce the long-term complications of NAFLD, including cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, liver-transplantation, liver-related mortality, and all-cause mortality, has not been examined. To address this knowledge gap, we will conduct a large, population-based cohort study using primary care, hospitalization, cancer registry, and death registry data from the United Kingdom. We will determine whether the use of GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors, when compared with the use of another antidiabetic drug, DPP-4 inhibitors, is associated with a decreased risk of liver complications among type 2 diabetes patients who were previously diagnosed with NAFLD. Given the heavy burden of NAFLD on the healthcare system, this study will have important policy implications, providing physicians, patients, and regulatory agencies with much-needed information regarding the long-term effectiveness of GLP-1 RAs and SGLT-2 inhibitors in preventing long-term NAFLD complications."
CAUSAL CORRELATES FOR SEXUAL OFFENDING: EVIDENCE FROM A LONGITUDINAL STUDY,"['Babchishin, Kelly M']",['N/A'],"['Causal Factors', 'Longitudinal Study', 'Nested Case-Control Design', 'Pedophilia', 'Sexual Offending']",90000.0,319019,"Sexual offending is a serious social and health problem that impacts many individuals. Although some victims are resilient, many experience a host of negative health outcomes including depression, anxiety, substance abuse, and poorer quality of life. Attempts at preventing sexual abuse will be most effective when based on a sound understanding of the motivations for these offences. The field has identified myriad factors that predict sexual reoffences by convicted sex offenders. Unfortunately, we know remarkably little about causal factors in the onset of sexual offending. The current longitudinal study will advance our understanding of causal candidates for the onset of sexual offending. Causal factors to be tested include perinatal factors, familial factors, and factors identified in childhood and adolescence. Participants will include approximately 21,000 convicted male sex offenders (identified between 1973 and 2009 in Sweden) who will be matched with non-sexual violent offenders and non-offending males from the general population. In addition, sex offenders will be compared with their non-offending siblings on these factors to determine the extent to which the factor is confounded by genetic and environmental influences. Sexual offences have serious consequences to the victims and extensive societal costs. Currently, most prevention efforts are based on the tertiary level (preventing sexual reoffence by convicted sex offenders) rather than on the primary level (preventing sexual offences from occurring in the first place). Results of the current study, which focus on mostly developmental factors, will therefore advance our theoretical and clinical understanding of sexual offending, help identify men who are at-risk for sexual offending, and help inform primary prevention efforts."

Three months later and barely surviving on no pension, she discovers the cheques in a bathroom drawer. She is hesitant to discuss her husband's health and when asked, she quietly whispers, ""I think he has the Alzheimer's."" Despite her reluctance, the news has slowly spread across town, and Edna now finds herself as the local town expert with others coming to her for advice. Edna shared her story with me in an interview on rural aging, and although cognitive health was not the study's focus, undertones of cognitive issues were observed.

Thousands of Canadians suffer from cognitive decline and this number is projected to increase significantly. Exploring the values and perceptions of cognitive health among cultural groups such as rural older adults facilitates the development of culturally acceptable interventions. The limited research and lack of cultural knowledge on rural older adults' cognitive health perceptions and beliefs has an important influence on the policies and interventions designed to support aging in rural communities. However, as a cultural group, rural seniors face important cognitive health challenges which are compounded by barriers to information, lower incomes, less education, lack of adequate housing, insufficient public transportation and limited access to health services. Using qualitative interviews and participant observation, this research will aim to develop an understanding of rural seniors' perceptions of cognitive health."
Does BMI miss the mark?

OA most often affects the knee, hip and hand as well as other limb joints, with most people having OA at 2 or more joint sites. While being obese is often described as a risk factor for OA, in practice, this largely only applies to osteoarthritis of the knee. Being heavier is associated not only with more load on the joints, especially the knee, but also with an increase of fat in the body. Belly fat in particular has been shown have a systemic component including causing joint inflammation. Obesity is usually measured by body mass index (BMI). However, BMI does not distinguish between fat and lean tissue, nor the distribution of fat within the body. To deal with these limitations, a number of adiposity indices have been developed which use waist measurements as a proxy for belly fat. These have not been systematically studied in OA. 
In this study we will use longitudinal data to estimate and compare the contribution of BMI and the different adiposity indices to the incidence of OA, overall and by joint sites affected (knee, hip, hand, combinations of these joints). For those with OA we will also compare the performance of BMI and the adiposity indices to describe changes in joint symptoms, physical function, and the development of other conditions. Analyses will be carried out for males and females separately as there are known differences by sex in the amount and distribution of body fat, and in the pattern of joints sites affected by OA. 
Our study could lay ground for the identification of an adiposity index as a new and more comprehensive risk factor for OA. Such a risk factor would provide a more sensitive tool than BMI for identifying individuals at risk and for clinical management, and potentially open the way for increasing attention to be paid to OA of joints other than the knee, and to multi-joint OA."
Development and Validation of Case Definitions for Cannabis Use Disorder within Administrative Data Sets,"['Bahji, Anees']",['N/A'],"['Administrative Data', 'Cannabis', 'Chronic Disease Indicators', 'Machine Learning', 'Predictive Value Of Tests', 'Reference Standards', 'Substance-Related Disorder']",220000.0,454390,"Background: Cannabis use disorder (CUD), or cannabis addiction, refers to the continued use of cannabis despite clinically significant impairment. Unfortunately, there is a shortage of information on CUD to guide healthcare. However, tapping into population-level data may improve CUD detection, documentation, prevention, and management. One source is health administrative data, which includes routinely collected diagnostic and procedural codes from encounters with the healthcare system. First, however, we must create and verify a ""case definition"" for CUD to use administrative data for CUD research. Case definitions are computer algorithms that combine diagnostic and procedural codes to identify people with CUD. In this project, we will use the latest technologies for complex data to change the current shortage of information about CUD into a wealth of new information that can be used to design new treatments, target the deployment of new services, and assess the impact of new treatments.

Aims: We will validate and compare the accuracy of several CUD case definitions in Alberta administrative health data.

Methods: Trained record reviewers will review 5,000 randomly selected files from a Calgary tertiary addiction centre and code them for the presence of CUD and link them to administrative health data. These records will serve as a reference standard for verifying case definitions. Two approaches for validating case definitions will be used and compared. In the traditional approach, we will make up a few case definitions and measure how sensitive and specific each is for CUD. In the second approach, we will use machine learning, in which a technique capable of learning from the data would be used to identify the best definition.

Impact and Significance: Determining case definitions for substance use disorders in administrative health databases will lay the groundwork for future research."

Molecular underpinnings of how paternal prenatal exposure to environmentally-relevant organochlorines compromises health of future generations: A possible mechanism for health discrepancies between Northern Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians,"['Bailey, Janice L', 'Droit, Arnaud']","['Kimmins, Sarah', 'Trasler, Jacquetta M']","['Bioinformatics', 'Environmental Contaminants', 'Epigenetic', 'Northern Aboriginal Canadians', 'Origins Of Disease', 'Paternal Health', 'Placenta', 'Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing', 'Rna-Seq', 'Transgenerational Transmission']",100000.0,285285,"Society is concerned about the impact of environmental contaminants on human health. Numerous highly publicized reports of deformities, disease and infertility have been attributed, at least in part, to environmental contaminants.
Many contaminants work their way up the food chain, as is the case for organochlorines in Canada's Far North. Northern Aboriginal populations have a significantly higher body burden of environmental contaminants, which may contribute to the major health disparity compared to non-aboriginal Canadians. Moreover, the ""developmental origins of adult disease"" model has been proposed to explain how exposure of the developing foetus to environmental stressors while still in the womb predisposes it to dysfunction later in life.
Although maternal exposures can affect child health and development, our recent disturbing findings indicate that the effects of environmental exposures can be transmitted to future generations via the father. These results shatter current public dogma that paternal health is inconsequential to child health.
Our objective is to use our proven rat model to determine the molecular underpinnings of how contaminants of the Northern food chain perturb the development and health of the next and subsequent generations in a paternally-mediated manner. Our central hypothesis is that prenatal exposure of the F1 male offspring to environmentally-relevant organochlorines induces epimutations in his sperm's DNA that increase birth defects and health problems in his F2 offspring. These sperm epimutations are transgenerationally-transmitted though the father's sperm, thereby inducing health problems in future  generations.
Together with our preliminary observations, our anticipated results will provide insight into many of the health concerns in the Far North, including high rates of preterm birth, stillbirth, infant mortality and poorer health of Inuit children and adults relative to non-Aboriginal Canadians."

Indigenous Land-Based Tools: Establishing Reliability and Validity,"['Baillie, Colin P']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Award'],1293.0,364864,"Reliability and validity are well-established criterion for evaluating the quality of surveys and tools in peer-reviewed Western literature.  While there is a lack of research on these concepts from an Indigenous perspective, approaches such as Two-Eyed Seeing acknowledge that Indigenous knowledge sources are valid and can help academics produce Indigenous wellness research that is considerate of multiple perspectives. Thus, the purpose of this presentation is to explore whether the concepts of reliability and validity are relevant for land-based learning in the context of a study aiming to develop a physical activity (PA) environment assessment tool for First Nations communities.  Briefly, youth co-researchers (n=14) from three First Nations communities examined the PA-environment relationship using Photovoice, the Rural Active Living Assessment tool (Yousefian et al., 2010), and talking circles. The findings from that study were used to inform the development of the PA environment assessment tool.  In order to ensure that the PA environment assessment tool is useful for First Nations peoples, the tool will be shared and validated with diverse First Nations communities. Potential alternatives to Western notions of reliability and validity include authenticity, the degree to which the tool remains true to the context in which it was created, and relational accountability, the understanding that everyone must speak the truth in order to maintain a relational balance with one another. This study will provide an example of ways in which Indigenous knowledge systems can be used to develop new quality criterion that ensure research is useful for First Nations communities."

Despite the popularity of these methodologies, researchers often apply Western standards of rigour (i.e. the concepts of reliability, validity, and generalisability) that are not necessarily congruent with Indigenous understandings of knowledge as relationship-based.  However, there is a dearth of literature available on possible criteria for rigour that are derived from Indigenous ways of knowing. Thus, the purpose of this study is to identify quality criteria from Indigenous peoples who work within an Indigenous research paradigm that may be used to refine and evaluate a culturally relevant physical activity environment assessment tool for Indigenous communities. In order to determine appropriate criteria, Indigenous Elders, scholars, and community members from different disciplines and regions of Turtle Island were invited to participate in the interviews on this topic. Following a participatory thematic analysis, the concepts of relational accountability, based on an understanding that everyone must speak the truth in order to maintain relational balance with one another, and authenticity, or the degree to which the tool remains true to the personal experiences of the co-researchers involved in its creation, were seen as important criteria for evaluating the quality of a physical activity environment assessment tool for Indigenous communities. This study contributes to the growing body of research that demonstrates the value that incorporating Indigenous ways of knowing can have for creating a more wholistic understanding of the physical activity environment. Once evaluated using this criteria, the physical activity environment assessment tool can be used to determine strengths of the community physical activity environment."

Women, children and indigenous populations are at the highest risk for food insecurity which can heavily impact nutrition status. Bolivia as a whole has a a high prevalence of chronic undernutrition (27%) and micronutrient deficiencies  particularly anaemia among women (52% ) and young children (37%). The time period from conception to two years of age, the 'critical 1000 days', is recognized as a nutritionally critical period for children to reach their growth and development potential through optimal nutrition. Fish, a culturally acceptable local resource, is an excellent source of energy, complete protein, micronutrients and essential fatty acids, although fish consumption data is lacking. In fact, little is known about current food intake, infant and young child feeding practices or other determinants of nutritional status and food security in these fishing communities. Therefore, the proposed study seeks to conduct a descriptive, cross sectional study to compare determinants of food insecurity among women and children in the Northern Bolivian Amazon with a focus on dietary diversity and fish consumption across seasons. Other factors include demographics household size, number of children, livelihoods, and education, infant and young child feeding practices as well as knowledge, attitudes and practices that may impact on nutrition and health outcomes. The study design consists of a quantitative household survey of 800 randomly selected households in the region administered in two seasons. Multiple regression analysis will be used to explore the determinants of food security and nutritional status. This exploratory study is intended to inform future research and development and may lead to targeted modules for improving women and children's nutrition using culturally acceptable food based approaches."

Child abuse has a variety of negative consequences that may be experienced at various stages throughout a survivor's life. One such consequence that has been linked to child abuse and other types of child trauma is chronic pain, a form of pain that persists over time. Chronic pain may also develop as a result of undertreated pain. Unfortunately, children's pain has been found to be frequently underestimated in Canadian healthcare, potentially resulting in undertreated pain. Further complicating this issue is that children have reported intentionally hiding their pain from others. More concerningly, survivors of child abuse who are already at a greater risk of developing chronic pain and other adverse consequences from the abuse have been found to have the potential to suppress their emotional expression, a key indicator of pain, and to conceal their experiences, which leaves them at even greater risk for their pain being underestimated. This research project will address this issue by examining how children who experienced abuse communicate their pain through their facial expressions and verbal descriptions of pain. It will also uncover how healthcare providers judge the facial expressions of pain in children who have been abused. That is, if healthcare providers can detect authentic, suppressed, and faked facial expressions of pain in children with a history of abuse. It is expected that children who were abused will conceal their pain expressions more than non-abused children. Moreover, it is expected that healthcare providers will struggle to detect authentic pain expressions more in abused children than non-abused children. This research has important implications for enhancing the assessment practices of pain used with abused children and understanding how children who suffered abuse communicate their pain."

Developing a Doorway to Accessible Supportive Care Resources for Parents of Seriously Ill Children: An Innovative Pediatric Palliative Care ePortal,"['Bally, Jill M', 'Spurr, Shelley']","['Brusky, Janna D', 'Hodgson-Viden, Heather', 'Holtslander, Lorraine F', 'Peacock, Shelley', 'Risling, Tracie L', 'Sinha, Roona']","['Digital Health', 'Family-Focused Care', 'Hope Science', 'Life Limiting Illness', 'Life Threatening Illness', 'Pediatric Health Care', 'Pediatric Palliative Care', 'Portal']",9995.0,411999,"Serious childhood illness disrupts family life and wellbeing. In Canada, over 1400 children with complex treatment needs receive specialized pediatric palliative care every year. However, many other children and families do not have access to such specialized care because it is inconsistently developed and available across Canada. To support development of improved pediatric palliative care, our team will bring together families, community organizations, knowledge users, researchers, graduate students, digital health specialists, and decision-makers from five Canadian provinces to come to agreement about important priorities for an electronic pediatric palliative care portal (ePortal). This novel tech innovation will allow families facing lengthy, traumatic health experiences to use resources to support their hope and other aspects of family health, and view health information about their child. This easy, accessible, secure ePortal may support family engagement in their child's care, empowerment, better communication, and overall family wellbeing. Thus, with funding, our team proposes to host a two-day meeting with those mentioned above including colleagues from British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Ontario to share experiences, knowledge, and other details needed to develop the priority components of the pediatric palliative care ePortal. The results of our meeting and work will be shared with our team and others through presentations and publications, and we will involve all participants in determining the next steps towards a new grant application aimed at developing a pediatric palliative care ePortal and evaluating its feasibility and effectiveness. We firmly believe that an ePortal will improve families' healthcare experiences and wellbeing during a very difficult and often traumatic time."

With the recent legalization of cannabis vape products in Canada, there are concerns that even more youth and young adults may engage in vaping and experience poor health outcomes. In order to develop education and policies around cannabis vaping that reflect the reality of youth and young adults, our proposed study aims to understand, in their own words, their experiences, beliefs, and decision-making associated with cannabis vaping. We will hold focus groups with a total of 40-50 individuals aged 12-25 years and living in Manitoba that will explore their experiences of using vaped cannabis products, their beliefs about the possible risks and benefits of vaping cannabis, and what factors influenced their decision to vape cannabis. Efforts will be made to invite a diverse group of youth and young adults, including those from the Indigenous/Métis communities and living in rural and remote regions of the province. A brief survey will assess individuals' vaping behaviour related to cannabis and other substances and personal information, such as their age, gender, and ethnicity. The survey data will be summarized using descriptive statistics, and the focus group data will be reviewed, compared, and organized into key themes and ideas. A Youth Advisory Committee will meet throughout the study and provide advice about how the study is conducted and help create strategies to share the study findings with youth and young adults in Manitoba and beyond. The results of this study will inform future education and decision support tools related to cannabis vaping and act as a catalyst for a larger national study that will guide public health policies related to cannabis and vaping."
"Evaluating the effectiveness of neuromuscular training on strength, coordination, and injury prevention in novice runners.","['Baltich, Jennifer']",['N/A'],"['Balance', 'Coordination', 'Health', 'Injury', 'Lower Extremity', 'Motor Control', 'Overuse', 'Running', 'Strength', 'Training']",150000.0,273558,"Running is an extremely popular sport with many known health benefits. As the number of runners has increased so has the number of running-related injuries, such as knee pain and shin splints. It has been shown that large rotations at the ankle, knee, and hip joints are predictors of running injury. Some clinicians believe that weak leg muscles are responsible for these large joint rotations. Previous injury prevention training programs have tried to increase leg strength in order to reduce joint movements. However, these training programs have thus far been unsuccessful in preventing running injuries. Poor leg strength and large joint movements have been related to injuries in other sports such as volleyball and soccer where injury prevention training programs have been applied successfully. These particular training programs included the addition of an unstable surface, such as a wobble board, to their exercises. This addition may challenge both the user's leg strength and coordination due to the difficulty of maintaining an upright posture on an unstable surface. While these training protocols have been successful for other sports, they have never been used for recreational running. The goal of this research project will be to determine if this training program is effective in reducing the number of injuries suffered by novice runners. This is particularly attractive as these training programs can be completed at home with equipment that is easily accessible to the public. This will allow for the training program to benefit a larger portion of the population, with minimal economic burden. Reducing the likelihood of injuries has the potential to have a widespread impact due to the popularity of recreational running in Canada. Avoiding injury will allow for Canadians to remain active and enjoy the benefits of participating in running. Additionally, a successful injury prevention program will also reduce the healthcare costs associated with running injuries."

The natural hormone changes that occur during menopause are associated with weight gain, changes in the distribution of body fat, and loss of lean muscle mass. Over one third (34.7%) of post-menopausal women are currently obese. Hormone therapy is often prescribed to women to manage the physical symptoms (e.g., hot flashes, migraine) that occur during and after menopause. However, our understanding of the effects of excess body weight (obesity) and hormone therapy in post-menopausal women remains incomplete. The two aims of this project are: 1) to understand how body weight changes over time in older women and 2) to study the relationship between obesity and hormone therapy in older women. 

For this project, I will be using data from nearly 30,000 post-menopausal women who participated in the Women's Health Initiative clinical trial. First, I will explore how body weight changes over time in post-menopausal women and how these changes affect risk factors for heart disease, such as high blood pressure and cholesterol. I will use advanced statistical methods to determine the effect of body weight changes on premature death. Second, I will examine whether hormone therapy and obesity interact to increase the risk of heart disease in post-menopausal women. 

The results of this research have great public health significance. Understanding how obesity and hormone therapy affect the risk of heart disease or premature death will: 1) help inform treatment guidelines and 2) enable scientists to develop intervention programs specifically targeting post-menopausal women. These results will contribute to our understanding of healthy aging in post-menopausal women and be used to develop strategies to improve women's health outcomes."

Low- and middle-income countries will face 80 percent of tobacco use related deaths by 2030. World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), one of the world's first health treaties, requires tobacco growing countries to phase out the supply of tobacco as part of a comprehensive approach to tobacco control. While the industry has portrayed tobacco as a lucrative commodity, recent research shows that it is not. Especially smallholder tobacco farmers in the top tobacco producing countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) face economic challenges. These tobacco producing countries are often caught between controlling tobacco consumption for population health, while at the same time pursuing tobacco production as an economic development strategy.  This study uses the case of Zimbabwe to examine these conflicting aims with an emphasis on moving towards coherent public policy for tobacco control. Zimbabwe despite signing the FCTC in 2014, remains the largest producer of tobacco in SSA and the sixth-largest in the world. Zimbabwe is also seeing an increase in tobacco use, especially among youth. Zimbabwe requires a holistic policy approach that will consider all political and economic factors and the perspectives of all relevant stakeholders, including those of farmers. This study will critically analyze the historical and current political and economic conditions that led to prevailing policy approaches. The study will use academic, non-academic literature, interviews with key stakeholders, and focus group discussions. This research will then identify pathways to a more coherent and comprehensive approach for tobacco control in Zimbabwe, with lessons for other tobacco growing countries that are pursuing tobacco control as a health policy goal."

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a temporary condition of pregnancy and could represent a growing population of young SA women at higher risk for diabetes.  It is unclear to what extent SA women have risk factors for diabetes and could differ from Caucasian women. Further, there is a clear need to understand the risk perception of diabetes and the ethno-cultural barriers to lifestyle modification.

The study objectives are: 1) To quantitatively assess differences in the risk factors, diabetes risk perception, self-efficacy and social support between SA women and Caucasian during pregnancy and post-partum. 2) To qualitatively explore the ethno-cultural barriers to lifestyle modification among SA women with GDM during pregnancy and post-partum.

This study will use data from a multi-centre observational study of Ontario women with GDM. Data on clinical, demographic, and psychosocial variables collected from questionnaires and medical charts during pregnancy and postpartum will be compared between SA and Caucasian women. Qualitative interviews will be conducted in a subset of SA women to identify less recognized themes and issues. 

This study will allow for the identification of risk factors and ethno-cultural barriers unique to SA women diagnosed with GDM that might further exacerbate their diabetes. This study will also allow for a greater understanding of diabetes risk factors in SA women, which will inform strategies to increase their knowledge and skill for risk reduction behaviors to prevent future diabetes."

The lower vaccination rate among residents in Parc Extension is attributable to vaccine hesitancy, characterized by uncertainty and ambivalence about vaccination, a legitimate viewpoint, underscoring the failure or lack of an effective public health system. In response, new and reimagined vaccine interventions that are community-led, culturally-relevant, and place-based have been developed in Parc Extension to successfully increase vaccine confidence and uptake. There is a clear need for better quality studies on the use of community-led vaccination strategies in promoting confidence, particularly in low income and diverse regions in Canada, where research capacities are limited. This proposed community-based research has the fundamental goal of producing qualitative evidence guided by grounded theory using Parc Extension, Québec as a case study in understanding dynamic community-led responses and developing a best practices implementation toolkit to address vaccine hesitancy. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with diverse key stakeholders in Parc Extension to understand the best practices required to establish successful and effective community-led vaccine strategies.

When working around issues of South Asian inequities, there is an oversimplified understanding of the South Asian identity based on cultural stereotypes, including the tendency to homogenize members of this racialized population. The South Asian anti-oppression training will acknowledge intersectional perspectives that propose that individuals in the South Asian diaspora occupy positions of power, privilege and oppression based on their unique colonial, historical, social, economic and political locations rooted in history, which in turn are determined by the interlocking axes of gender, class, caste, sexuality, religion, and other determinants of identity. The intersectional perspective suggests that oppressions are experienced differently across the South Asian diaspora population. A series of planning meetings and provincial and national dialogues will be organized across Canada. These opportunities will allow the exchange of perspectives, experiences, and priorities in the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the South Asian anti-oppression training, and to hear from the diverse South Asian and non-South Asian stakeholders for whom this training is intended. These insights will be reflected in the design of an implementation research agenda that seeks to trial the South Asian anti-oppression training. The implementation research collaboration is premised on the value of co-learning and multi-stakeholder engagement around the complexity of South Asian health inequities, and the goal of producing evidence-based and solutions for policy uptake."

The Indigenous Health Conference is an interdisciplinary conference that will take place through the University of Toronto, on November 20th and 21st 2014. Although we realize that health equity for Indigenous peoples is a long-term process that involves multiple partners, we feel that this conference will make a contribution towards improving Canadian Indigenous peoples' access to quality healthcare.  The conference agenda is led by the conference committee who are Indigenous health care providers, and/or individuals who have long term experience working with and advocating for health for Indigenous populations. The conference will comprise of plenary sessions, workshops and poster presentations. There will be a call for abstracts which will allow researchers and community workers to profile their work. All the keynote and plenary speakers are Indigenous, and most of the workshops are led by Indigenous leaders. Learning cultural competency and safety is a long-term process, but the two days of the conference is a beginning for many individuals who have never had any education. In addition, we are having a job fair to try to help match healthcare providers with employment opportunities working with Indigenous communities.

Certain cancers disproportionately impact individuals of SA heritage, compared to other ethnicities. SAs are also among the most sedentary groups in Canada. Managing previously identified barriers to current exercise oncology programming may potentially improve overall well-being. Objectives: Phase 1 Purpose: to develop tailored exercise oncology resources for the SA population. Phase 2 Purpose: to examine the effectiveness of a Punjabi tailored exercise oncology intervention on quality of life. Methods: The proposed PhD work will involve a series of studies conducted in phases. Phase 1: Tailoring. An advisory team will be appointed (individuals diagnosed with cancer, relevant community leaders, clinicians, etc.) to ensure appropriate tailoring of existing exercise oncology intervention materials. Phase 2: Intervention. Punjabi-speaking individuals diagnosed with cancer will be recruited through various avenues identified by the advisory team. The Punjabi exercise oncology intervention will involve group exercise sessions of two classes per week over 12 weeks over three waves. To evaluate the intervention, RE-AIM measures including reach (number of individuals eligible; number enrolled), effectiveness (physical and psychosocial outcomes), adoption (program adherence; measurement completion; adverse events; satisfaction), implementation (modifications indicated from data and quality improvement participant interviews after each wave), and maintenance (markers of sustainability). Significance: No exercise oncology program development, implementation, and evaluation work has been conducted with individuals of SA heritage in North America. Given their lack of access to exercise as a supportive cancer care resource, individuals of SA heritage may benefit from the potential health outcomes of exercise oncology interventions, ultimately enhancing their quality of life."
Network Meta-Analysis of Opioid Agonist Treatments for street opioid users,"['Bansback, Nicholas', 'Oviedo-Joekes, Eugenia']","['Anis, Aslam H', 'Brissette, Suzanne', 'Marsh, David C', 'Palis, Heather', 'Schechter, Martin T', 'Westfall, Jordan', 'Zhang, Wei']",['Opioid Treatment'],145350.0,390094,"Opioids (e.g. heroin, fentanyl, etc.) acquired in the street and injected in unsafe conditions remain a significant public health challenge. While oral medications such as methadone work well, only approximately 40% of people with opioid use disorder are retained in methadone treatment in their first year. Discontinuing treatment and continuing to inject street opioids leaves people at high risk of HIV, hepatitis C and overdose death. Other opioid agonist treatments exist that can be used instead of methadone, including buprenorphine, morphine, diacetylmorphine, the active ingredient in heroin, and hydromorphone, also known as Dilaudid™. Currently, it is difficult to make an informed decision between treatments, as evidence comparing these treatments to one another is limited. Most trials have compared methadone against alternative opioid treatments. As a result, evidence of the effectiveness of different treatments to one another, for example, buprenorphine compared to morphine or compared to hydromorphone is unknown. While a new trial could answer this question, it would be expensive, complicated to conduct, and take too long to complete to address the current crisis. Instead we propose to use network meta-analysis, a methodology that enables us to synthesize trials to make indirect comparisons of effectiveness between different treatments. Network meta-analysis is routinely used by federal policy makers in Canada to address drugs and technologies, but so far has not been applied to opioid agonist treatments. We will identify all relevant trials to form the 'network', extract their data, and then apply statistical meta-analysis techniques to calculate the results. In addition to publishing the results, in partnership with our study's Knowledge Users and Collaborator, we will produce a simple results info-graphic and an online tool that will provide users with individualized estimates of their risk of outcomes on each of the compared treatments."

More than a quarter-century later and in an increasingly broad range of countries, contexts and development levels, male-to-male sexual contact remains an important route of HIV transmission. Men who haves sex with men is a technical phrase intended to be less stigmatizing than culturally bound terms such as gay, bisexual, or homosexual. It describes same-sex behaviors between men rather than identities, orientations, or cultural categories. Therefore, the term MSM includes gay men, bisexuals, MSM who do not identify as gay or bisexual despite their behaviors, male sex workers, transgendered people, and a range of culture- and country-specific populations of MSM. 

Research among MSM in low- and middle-income countries has been limited by the criminalization and social stigmatization of their behavior, safety considerations for study participants, the hidden nature of this population, and lack of targeted funding. Thus, most available data evaluating determinants of HIV risk among MSM are derived from high-income countries. Data regarding MSM in Africa are the sparsest in the world, but are beginning to emerge.  

We recently completed the first study to evaluate HIV risk status of MSM in Malawi and demonstrated that MSM are a high-risk group for HIV infection and human rights abuses.  In response to this, we are proposing a pre-intervention study of the potential utility of combined biomedical and behavioral HIV prevention strategies for MSM in Malawi.  This work would use both quantitative and qualitative methods to better characterize which HIV prevention strategies are most likely to work for MSM in Malawi.  The results of this study are vital to inform future clinical trials of HIV prevention strategies as well as being used when advocating for the targeted allocation of HIV prevention expenditures based on evidence-based need for MSM in Malawi."

For example, victims of family violence would find it difficult to access supports if the abuser was home all day and the increased stress of the pandemic could create tension that could make the violence worse. In fact, some have referred to this as the shadow pandemic and the pandemic paradox. This project will examine how family violence against women was impacted during this time, and how organizations that support these women adapted in order to continue to support their clients. Two studies are proposed. The first study will collect the most relevant information that already exists in the literature about how COVID-19 impacted family violence. It will synthesise this literature and identify important patterns such as who was most impacted and what supports were most useful. The second study will conduct interviews with young women and mothers who have experienced family violence. From these interviews we will extract patterns to identify the challenges and supports that they encountered when trying to seek help during the pandemic. In particular, we will identify patterns such as gaps in services that could increase homelessness and places where changes in service provision were helpful. 
     This project will be a joint effort between researchers, community organizations, and women who have experienced family violence.  By working together, we will learn from each other and help ensure that the information gained is useful to policymakers, advocates, and service providers. We have also integrated a number of strategies to help ensure a collaborative process that will lead to actionable recommendations to improve the lives of women that have experienced family violence."

L'activité physique, lorsqu'elle est adaptée aux particularités du sujet âgé, permet de prévenir la diminution de la capacité fonctionnelle. Les recommandations en termes d'activité physique chez la personne âgée demeurent non consensuelles et non spécifiques aux pathologies. Nous ignorons aussi comment évolue la composition corporelle et les capacité fonctionnelles des personnes âgées actives. L'objet de cette étude est donc, dans un premier temps, de comparer la prévalence des personnes ayant une faible force musculaire en fonction du type d'activité pratiqué, puis de caractériser la composition corporelle et les capacités fonctionnelles des personnes âgées actives ayant une faible force musculaire, et de comparer ces caractéristiques en fonction de leur type de pratique. Cette étude impliquera 1000 personnes actives (hommes et femmes) âgées de 50 ans et plus, membres des YMCA. Leur composition corporelle, leur force musculaire, leur capacité fonctionnelle et habitudes passées et actuelles en terme d'activité physique, ainsi que leur fonction cardio-respiratoire seront mesurées. L'étendue des activités pratiquées par les participants nous permettra de déterminer les activités les plus adaptées à la prévention des incapacités fonctionnelles chez les personnes âgées de 50 ans et plus. Nous pourrons affiner ces recommandations en fonction du sexe, de l'âge et des pathologies et clarifier le discours de prévention présenté aux personnes âgées, ainsi qu'aux jeunes adultes afin de réduire l'occurrence des incapacités fonctionnelles et des coûts qui leurs sont associés."

Hiv Prevention)', 'Vulnerabilities']",108000.0,317847,"In Canada, Aboriginal individuals represent 4.3% of the total Canadian population, yet Aboriginal persons account for 8.9% of the prevalent HIV infections. Aboriginal women are greatly over-represented in the Canadian sex industry and face serious sexual health inequities (e.g. higher incidence and prevalence of HIV, compared to non-Aboriginal sex workers). To enhance sexual health promotion and prevention efforts against HIV, more culturally-tailored health services are needed for Aboriginal female sex workers (AFSWs), especially among those who migrate to Vancouver in search for better social and financial opportunities. The overall aim of this study is to assess access to culturally safe sexual health care of AFSWs, factors that enhance sexual health resilience or vulnerability, and how these may be altered by internal migration between Aboriginal communities and Vancouver, Canada. The main objectives of the study are to 1) investigate the association between internal migration from Aboriginal communities (e.g. First Nations reserves) and sexual health (i.e. both risks and protective factors) among AFSWs; 2) evaluate the relationship between internal migration and access to Aboriginal-tailored sexual health services for AFSWs over time; 3) describe the ways in which internal migration and other structural determinants influence health-related protective experiences, vulnerabilities, and access to care for Aboriginal AFSWs; 4) employ a resiliency-based approach to identify opportunities for culturally safe sexual health promotion and care for AFSWs.  By conducting research in close partnership with AFSWs and community partners, this study seeks to implement a resiliency-based approach to inform culturally safe sexual health services for Aboriginal women in the Canadian sex industry."

A park-based, outdoor walking study for older adults with difficulty walking outdoors (""GO-OUT""), found increased walking confidence after the 10-week walk group program. Participants increased the distance and speed of walking in parks during the program. 

The purpose of the planning meeting is to identify community organization needs, challenges, priorities and strategies for community implementation of an outdoor walking group for older adults with walking difficulties. This will be the first step towards adaptation and implementation of the outdoor walking program.

The meeting will be virtual, using Zoom, and held on two half-days. Community organizations will attend and identify interested members. The 4 organizations support active living for older adults, networking among senior communities, support programs and well-being of individuals living with disabilities, and design accessible programing. Meeting participants will represent a mix of genders, individuals with disabilities, those living in rural and urban settings and from different socio-economic and cultural backgrounds. Day 1 will summarize the GO-OUT project and discuss community organization needs for outdoor walking programs for older adults with difficulty walking outdoors including those from under-represented groups. Day 2 will review the prioritized needs and discuss challenges to implementing a walking program and strategies that will enable implementation.

This meeting will be key in creating community organization connections and prioritizing community needs, with representation of diverse community members. A meeting summary with feedback from participants and a journal article describing the meeting process and priorities will be created. Results will inform an implementation project research grant."

Periconceptional cortisol levels and stress axis ontogenesis and post-natal functioning.,"['Barha, Cindy']",['N/A'],"['Child Development', 'Cortisol Assays', 'Endocrinology', 'Epigenetics', 'Health Research', 'Maternal Health', 'Maternal Stress', 'Population Health', 'Prenatal Environment', 'Stress']",135000.0,270030,"Adverse prenatal conditions, such as maternal exposure to stress, can have important consequences for fetal development and increase disease susceptibility across the lifespan. High levels of stress during pregnancy have been shown to alter children's behavioural, emotional, cognitive, immune, and metabolic functioning. Existing evidence suggest that these negative outcomes may be a consequence of changes in the development of the stress axis. Previous studies on prenatal stress, however, begin evaluating maternal stress levels only after pregnancies are clinically recognized, missing the first six weeks of gestation, a 'critical period' for the development of the fetus. Therefore the proposed study will investigate the role maternal stress level has in the programming of the stress axis during that crucial window of vulnerability for the fetus and evaluate its subsequent function during the transition to puberty. To understand the mechanisms involved in the programming of the stress axis we will investigate how relevant genes are activated or de-activated in children and how these patterns of gene expression are associated with maternal stress levels from the first six weeks of gestation. The proposed study will be the first to look at how maternal stress levels during the child's earliest developmental environment, the first six weeks after conception, influence adolescent development. The results from this study will provide novel information critical to understanding how adverse early-life experiences can 'get under the skin' and impact physical and mental health outcomes later in life. Ultimately this research may aid in the development of public policy for prevention and intervention programs for at-risk mothers and children."
The impact of forced institutionalization on the expansion of drug injecting epidemics: Evidence from a multi-site study of people who inject drugs in North America,"['Barker, Brittany M']",['N/A'],"['Child Welfare System', 'Epidemiology', 'Hiv Prevention', 'Incarceration', 'Injection Initiation', 'Institutionalization', 'Mixed Methods', 'Multi-Site Study', 'People Who Inject Drugs', 'Street-Involved Youth']",150000.0,376323,"Across North America, the opioid epidemic continues to escalate with many cities declaring public health emergencies. In this context, preventing, rather than reacting to, the initiation of injection drug use (IDU) is of critical public health importance. Despite prior studies finding that the majority of people who inject drugs (PWID) reported being initiated into IDU by someone who injects drugs, very few interventions have focused on the role of PWID in IDU initiation. Relatedly, very little is known about how periods of institutionalization impact the risk that PWID initiate others into IDU. This is concerning as PWID are frequently institutionalized against their will (child welfare system, compulsory addiction treatment, prison), and there is a high likelihood for population mixing between PWID and injection-naïve individuals during institutionalization. To better understand how and why PWID initiate others into IDU, this study will use advanced epidemiologic research methods to examine how periods of institutionalization influence the likelihood that PWID report providing IDU initiation assistance. It is hypothesized that experiences of institutionalization will increase the risk of PWID reporting initiating others into IDU and that sociodemographic, drug-related and other broader factors (e.g., housing, access to opioid substitution therapy [buprenorphine]) will modify (either increase or decrease) this risk. These hypotheses will be tested using data from three observational cohort studies of PWID in Vancouver, Canada, San Diego, USA and Tijuana, Mexico. This study will be the first to investigate the likelihood of initiating others into IDU during periods of institutionalization and to compare health and drug use outcomes among diverse populations across North America. It is hoped that the findings will inform IDU prevention efforts and programming for child welfare systems, correctional facilities and addiction treatment facilities in Canada and abroad."
Indigenizing harm reduction: Identifying barriers to Western systems and supporting community-driven approaches to reduce opioid-related mortalities among Indigenous people who use drugs in British Columbia,"['Barker, Brittany M']",['N/A'],"['Community-Based Research', 'Epidemiology', 'First Nations And Indigenous People', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health Policy', 'Health System Improvements', 'Indigenous Methodologies', 'Opioid Misuse']",108500.0,387675,"As the opioid crisis in Canada continues, British Columbia is undoubtedly the epicentre with over 1,400 fatal overdoses in 2017. Government statistics indicate that First Nations people are five times more likely to die of an overdose than non-First Nations people in BC, and that this difference is greater for First Nations women and youth compared to non-First Nations women and youth. Despite an array of harm reduction and addiction treatment services in BC, First Nations people encounter several barriers to accessing and completing care and services including, racism and stigma, lack of service availability and anonymity in rural and remote communities, and trauma associated with colonization and the residential school system. In 2013, the First Nations Health Authority (FNHA) became the only province-wide First Nations health authority and since then, has been a primary player in BC's response to the crisis. As such, FNHA has identified key policy challenges that the proposed work will seek to address: prevent fatal overdoses, reduce drug-related harms (e.g., HIV), and increase service access, treatment options and culturally safe support for Indigenous people who use drugs (IPWUD) throughout the province. The proposed work will consist of 3 components with the overarching goal to develop a First Nations-led model of harm reduction that improves access and retention to supports and services, ultimately reducing opioid-related deaths among IPWUD. Part of the work will involve community-based research with 5 of BC's First Nations from each of FNHA's health regions to help articulate 'promising practices' from community harm reduction programs. The other components will identify ways to improve access, retention and cultural safety of harm reduction and treatment services in collaboration with FNHA and the provincially-mandated BC Centre on Substance Use. Findings will inform FNHA policy and programming, and be shared with health system partners in BC and beyond."

Whether it is the events that precede government intervention or the experiences youth go through during their tenure in government care, research indicates that the child welfare system is not sufficiently protective. The outcomes for youth who age-out of government care are also troubling, as the transition into independence is fraught with challenges as services are abruptly terminated at the legal age of majority in BC. While there is growing concern for this highly vulnerable population and several targeted interventions have been developed, little has been done to assess the impact of these efforts on health outcomes and behaviours. Specific questions driving the proposed research include: do permanent and family-based care arrangements have significantly better outcomes than group-care or residential institutions? Do youth who age-out of care demonstrate elevated rates of HIV risk behaviour, substance misuse, incarceration, and homelessness? Do independent living models and extension of care past the age of majority mitigate these effects? Drawing on data from a longitudinal cohort of over 700 street-involved youth who use illicit drugs, this research proposal seeks to study the impact that targeted interventions to support youth in, and aging out of, the child welfare system have on health outcomes. This study will be undertaken at the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS at St. Paul's Hospital. It is hoped the proposed research will inform future policy interventions to improve the child welfare system, especially among those who age-out of government care."

Both are socially patterned conditions, with the likelihood of being obese or of having asthma differing from one neighbourhood to the next. More recent studies conducted among youth with asthma have observed a great deal of neighbourhood differences in asthma control, considered to be the worldwide standard for monitoring the adequacy of asthma management. In contrast to obesity, however, comparatively few studies have sought to identify specific factors explaining neighbourhood-level differences in asthma control, and little is known about the specific dimensions within built and social environments could be targeted to help improve asthma control. In this study, we examine three dimensions of neighbourhood context believed to affect asthma control: air quality (i.e. traffic related pollutants), built environment (i.e. walkability), and social environment (i.e. area deprivation). We also examine if obesity increases vulnerability to an adverse neighbourhood environment, in a population of asthmatic youth. Our objectives will be pursued using a database comprising a large clinical population of youth diagnosed with asthma, many of which were followed over time. Data from individual patient records and on medication use have already been collected; the current proposal will construct and merge a new database containing indicators of the three neighborhood dimensions of interest. These indicators will be created for several neighbourhood boundaries to allow sensitivity analyses, and over several time points, to capture change over time. We then examine spatial variation in the relationships of interest, and identify which specific neighbourhood characteristics may be involved. This unique infrastructure will also allow us better understand the relationship between asthma, obesity, and neighbourhood context, providing a basis for developing environmental interventions."

There is growing concern that parabens may be implicated in the development and maintenance of obesity and related cardiometabolic risk. If exposure to parabens were shown to adversely impact adiposity, the government could implement measures to limit exposure. Unfortunately, studies assessing the impact of paraben exposure on pediatric obesity are limited.

Secondarily, we will explore associations between: i) baseline paraben exposure and cardiometabolic outcomes; ii) baseline paraben exposure and pubertal development status; and iii) neighbourhood food environment and exposure to parabens."

However, limitations in previous studies make it difficult to draw clear conclusions about the effects of air pollution on the developing fetus. Much of the previous research has failed to accurately assess air pollution exposures and has not adequately accounted for factors that could bias interpretation of study findings. Additionally, few studies have tested interventions that may improve reproductive outcomes. This study will assess the effectiveness of portable air filters in reducing the risk of impaired fetal growth in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, one of the world's most polluted cities. The novel study design will address limitations of previous studies while allowing for a practical and cost-effective investigation in a setting where pollution levels are very high and where the intervention can dramatically reduce exposures. If air filters are shown to be effective, this research will provide compelling evidence of a causal role of air pollution on fetal growth. Given that air pollution is ubiquitous, evidence that supports the use of a simple, effective, and relatively inexpensive intervention can have important population level health benefits in Canada and globally."

In care settings, little is offered beyond basic needs and there are few opportunities for meaningful activities or community engagement. Engagement with the arts can reduce stigma and increase social inclusion of people living with dementia. However, the arts are most often restricted to therapy rather than supporting life enrichment. Sharing Dance Older Adults (SDOA) is a community-oriented, evidence-informed dance program that makes dance accessible to people living with dementia by prioritizing creative self-expression and social engagement. SDOA has been engaging communities living with dementia since 2013 and has been found to be effective in reducing stigma. To increase opportunities to engage with SDOA, a training course was created for dance artists to build their capacity to engage people living with dementia in dance. Despite these efforts, historically excluded populations have had only limited engagement with SDOA and its associated training course. To address this, the current project will: (1) strengthen the integration and spread of SDOA with historically excluded communities (specifically Black, Chinese, and South Asian communities) by supporting the adaptation of the program by artists from these communities as per their culture of dance and music; 2) build capacity of dance artists within these communities to teach the program; (3) continue to develop partnerships with people and organizations (e.g., artists, older adult organizations) from these communities to co-develop and implement SDOA in order to contribute to a sustained and equitable impact; (4) engage knowledge users throughout the entirety of the project to optimize uptake of SDOA and maximize research relevance and impact; and (5) use a qualitative, multiple and intrinsic-case study design to explore the different factors that enable or constrain effective  implementation (uptake and impact)."

Measuring a person's well-being is important to provide information to help make decisions about policy, programs, and treatments. There are many types of HRQL measures that can be used in adults but there are few for children, especially those under five years of age. It is important to measure HRQL in early childhood since these years have an important effect on adult life. If we are able to measure HRQL, factors that affect a child's well-being can be described, and steps can be taken to help improve HRQL through programs and policies. This study will take an existing system that describes HRQL in children 2.5 to 5 years of age (preschoolers), and match these health descriptions to a similar system that is used in children (over 5yrs of age) and adults to measure HRQL. The adult system not only describes HRQL but gives us a score that is based upon community health values. By linking the two systems, researchers will be able to provide a HRQL score for preschoolers which can be compared to scores for older children and adults. A score for HRQL is important since it allows researchers and decision-makers to determine whether differences or relationships are present. This study will also test how well this scoring system measures HRQL in preschoolers by using the system in both healthy children and children who have health problems. Creating this system to measure HRQL in preschoolers is important because it will allow for more research into issues that affect well being in this group, as well as help to develop and evaluate programs and policies to improve the lives of children."

Factors that are associated with rurality and that may predict these help seeking behaviours will also be examined such as travel time to the nearest mental health service centre and nearest general health service centre, having a family physician, and prevalence of health professionals in the nearest town. This study will be completed using health services data from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Research. We hypothesize that lower rates of help seeking will be associated with increasing distance to nearest hospital or mental health services centre, lower prevalence of mental health care professionals and other health professionals and lack of primary care physician. 

This research contributes new knowledge because previous research comparing suicide rates in Canada is based on 1996 data and does not evaluate health care service utilization prior to suicide.(1) Additionally, help seeking prior to suicide attempts have not yet been compared in an urban versus rural setting. This research is important because rural populations are vulnerable and historic trends suggest increased risk of suicide.(2, 3) My background growing up in a rural setting living and working on a farm, previous epidemiological research involving rural populations, my undergraduate degree in Psychology and my experiences as a suicide phone line volunteer are reasons why I am an ideal candidate to conduct this research."
COVID19's Impact on Refugee/Migrant Equity-Deserving Groups in Latin America,"['Bartels, Susan A']","['Aldersey, Heather M', 'Collier, Amanda', 'Pritchard, Jodie']","['Covid19', 'Disabilities', 'Latin America', 'Lgbtq+', 'Migrant', 'Refugee', ""Women'S Health""]",499955.0,460363,"Venezuela has been experiencing a severe socioeconomic and political crisis for several years, now compounded by COVID19. With 7.5 million people in need of humanitarian assistance in Venezuela and another 5.6 million Venezuelans in need in other countries, it is now the world's second-largest external displacement crisis after Syria. COVID19 has exacerbated long-standing socioeconomic inequalities between migrants and local communities. This has created an urgent need for research on how the COVID19 pandemic is impacting refugees and migrants in Latin America as well as differential and disproportionate effects on known equity-deserving groups.

We will conduct mixed methods research using an innovative 'SenseMaking' (SM) approach to understand the broader impacts of COVID19 in Latin America with a particular focus on different groups of refugees and migrants, including women/girls, LGBTIQ+ individuals, and persons with disabilities. SM is based on the recognition that storytelling is a natural way to convey complex information and is used by individuals to make sense of their experiences. Using SM, participants audio-record a story in response to an open-ended prompt, thus generating the qualitative data. After the recording, participants then interpret their own experiences by plotting their perspectives. SM quantifies each of the plotted points, providing statistical data backed up by the accompanying explanatory narratives.  Multiple-choice questions collect demographic information and help to contextualize the shared story. By collecting many self-interpreted stories, SM leverages the ""wisdom of the crowds,"" and collectively, the participants' interpretation responses create a nuanced picture in the same way pixels come together to produce a clear image. 

Objectives: We will use SM to holistically examine the social, economic, security, health, and cultural impacts of COVID19 among refugee/migrant equity-deserving groups in Latin America."
An application of Super-Imposition by Translation And Rotation (SITAR) modelling to population-level child height trajectories of children aged 0-5 years using data from 145 Demographic Health Surveys (DHS) from 64 countries between 2000 and 2018,"['Bassani, Diego G', 'Roth, Daniel E']","['Ohuma, Eric O', 'Yang, Seungmi']","['Child Growth, Growth Modelling, Dhs, Sdgs, Who 2025 Targets']",340426.0,408906,"Reducing the burden of child growth faltering and malnutrition is a prioritized global public health target that is represented within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the WHO global targets for 2025 and includes Canada where obesity is a major public health challenge. Specifically, the SDG's goals 2 and 3 relate to improved nutrition, good health and well-being. The Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) are a rich source of data that records population-representative health information and includes indicators of child growth and malnutrition in low and middle-income countries. Typically, height and weight data is standardized by sex and age of the child based on the WHO child growth standards as the reference population. The availability of multiple waves of DHS data for each country provides an opportunity to study these secular trends in height and weight that have occurred within and between countries. We propose to use DHS data collected between 2000 and 2018 from 64 countries (145 surveys) to adapt an applied model, previously used to characterize adolescent growth, to describe child growth trajectories with the aim of quantifying changes in growth at a population level in the following domains: absolute growth, rate of growth, and timing of growth. We will use a methodology of growth curve analysis that summarizes the entire growth trajectory into these three biologically meaningful parameters related to growth. The methodology fits a single mean curve to all data and estimates differences in growth for each survey data relative to the estimated mean derived from using all the data. We will then use these parameters estimated for each survey, and separately for boys and girls, to explore associations between attained size and other target national and global indicators used to evaluate whether a country is on track to achieving international targets such as reducing the burden of child growth faltering and malnutrition."

Frailty is a clinical state in which there is an increase in an individual's vulnerability for developing increased dependency and/or mortality when exposed to a stressor.  There is a hypothesis that the link between poor oral health and frailty is through poor nutrition.  Poor oral health (such as loss of teeth, dental pain, and/or chewing problems) could cause an individual to choose foods that are easier to chew and eat (generally less healthy and less nutrient dense foods), and this then contributes frailty.  However, studies where this is tested over time to be able to take into account the effects of poor oral health and poor nutrition on worsening frailty have not yet been done.  We propose to test for the effects of age, gender, and potentially changeable risk factors such as smoking, poor social support, and low physical activity, on the worsening over time of oral health, nutrition, and frailty.  We will also describe the influence of being poor on these changes.  Finally, we propose a longitudinal analyses to better explain how to delay or lessen frailly by improving oral health or by improving nutrition, and therefore to promote healthy aging."
Do the causes of infertility play a role in the health of children born to couples with low fertility?,"['Basso, Olga']","['Gagnon, Robert', 'Holzer, Hananel', 'Monnier, Patricia O', 'Platt, Robert W', 'Tamblyn, Robyn M']","['Child Health', 'Infertility', 'Infertility Treatment', 'Pregnancy']",597618.0,255068,"In vitro fertilization and other medical technologies allow many couples with fertility problems to have a child. Children born as a result of assisted conception have a higher risk of preterm birth and other adverse outcomes, and we have limited knowledge about whether their later health may be affected by having been conceived through infertility treatment. To date, research has focused primarily on assisted reproductive technologies as the main cause of adverse outcomes. However, several underlying conditions can affect fertility, and it is thus important to also study the various causes of infertility for their potential to affect perinatal and child health. Although several experts have identified this as a priority, research in this area is very limited. As, in August 2010, Quebec has implemented a publicly funded program to provide infertility treatment to eligible couples, and other Canadian provinces may soon follow in its footsteps, we need a timely answer to these questions. We will use clinical data from women who attended a large infertility centre over a period of 15 years and a sample of women who gave birth in the same hospital during the same time period. By linking these with data from the Régie de l'Assurance Maladie du Québec (RAMQ), we will be able to follow children over time for a number of endpoints and assess their health as a function of both infertility treatment and the underlying causes of infertility in their parents. This study has the potential to not only improve our understanding of the risks associated with infertility and its treatment, but also to help provide more informed care to couples experiencing fertility problems."

First Nations continue to experience lower income, a lower life expectancy and higher rates of chronic and infectious disease and mental health issues than the general population. Food insecurity and poor diet quality are serious issues in First Nation communities. In a climate of limited government funding, research is needed to understand how to develop effective strategies and sustain collaborative approaches to address food insecurity and poor health outcomes in First Nation communities. Given the troubling very high rates of food insecurity in many First Nation communities, NPA Principal Investigator  Dr. Malek Batal, and co-investigators Dr. Olivier Receveur, Sonia Isaac-Mann, Dr. Laurie Chan, Dr. Noreen Willows along with a New Researcher, Dr. Geneviève Mercille and identified community partners (the Assembly of First Nations, Food Secure Canada, Farm to Cafeteria Canada)and knowledge users Karen Fediuk and Andrew Black are committed to the development of sustainable food interventions to improve dietary quality, food security and to promote environmental stewardship on-reserve. Funds from the planning grant will be used to develop communication between the stakeholders, culminating in a two-day meeting in Ottawa to be held May 27-28 2013. This meeting will allow stakeholders to review the current knowledge regarding food security in First Nation communities and set research priorities for a future grant proposal."

Much of the variability cannot readily be explained: food insecurity is experienced by wage-earning households and those receiving pensions and social assistance. Other factors including inadequate income, suppressed access and use of culturally appropriate foods and rising costs of market food are implicated in the poor food quality, nutrient inadequacy and high rates of obesity in First Nations households. A CIHR planning grant supported the 'Pulling Together for Health' meeting convened in October 2013 which brought together representatives from First Nations, government, non-governmental organizations and academia to discuss the state of food security in First Nation communities and prioritize food security research. As part of the meeting outcome, a steering committee composed of representatives from Assembly of First Nations, First Nations Health Authority, Food Secure Canada and academic researchers was formed. The steering committee is proposing collaborative multi-method research to explain differences in food insecurity between First Nations communities and to identify elements of successful community-based approaches to improve food security that will inform nutrition policy development."

Since 2004, the Okanagan Nation Alliance (ONA) in British Columbia (BC) has been working on the Sockeye Reintroduction to Skaha Lake Project and other habitat restoration initiatives to increase the number of salmon in the Okanagan. Scientific evidence of increased salmon numbers resulted in an increase in fish harvesting in ONA communities since 2012. The salmon restoration initiatives operate outside of the health sector yet have the potential to impact population health by improving health and nutrition, as well as modifying the determinants of health. This study of seven BC ONA reserve communities will estimate the health, health determinant and cultural outcomes of this First Nations-led ecosystem revitalization intervention and accompanying cultural activities. We aim to achieve the following objectives.
1. Estimate changes in socioeconomic factors, traditional food consumption, cultural connectedness, self-determination, diet quality, food security, and risk factors for obesity, diabetes and heart disease.
2. Explore how and why salmon revitalization efforts benefited community members.
3. Examine the contextual elements (e.g., community engagement, political leadership) that made salmon revitalization initiatives successful.
4. Document if the salmon revitalization initiatives resulted in different health outcomes for certain groups, such as men and women, and younger and older adults.
5. Estimate the cost of salmon revitalization initiatives and accompanying cultural activities.
6. Maximize opportunities for ONA, BC First Nations Health Authority, and other Indigenous communities and agencies to use the findings to support health and nutrition programming, garner financial support for future fisheries programs, and make traditional foods accessible through ecosystem recovery efforts"

This double burden of malnutrition magnifies their risk of developing diet-related chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension (Hyp). In parallel, many rural Indigenous people in Ecuador have organized around alternative food networks (AFNs) such as farmers' markets to seek more sustainable livelihoods. These local AFNs support food environments and practices that hold strong potential to prevent DM and Hyp among participating farmers. For example, AFNs have been demonstrated to promote food literacy, favor consumption of fruits, vegetables and whole grains, and to place income in women's hands; these, in turn have all been associated with healthier nutritional status and reduced risk of diet-related chronic disease. Our research aims to evaluate specific AFN attributes for their measurable contribution to DM and Hyp prevention in order to leverage the most effective attributes for a stronger and broader positive impact. To do so, we will use validated instruments for assessing diet and physiological risk factors among AFN farming households and a comparison group of non-AFN neighbouring farmers, and we will use participatory qualitative research to determine the most effective implementation strategy for translating research findings into practice. Our implementing partners run an ongoing intervention for managing communication and knowledge-sharing among an estimated 132 Ecuadorian AFNs, positioning them as the cornerstone for streamlining research findings into practice. Through the implementation of our research findings, we expect to provide strategic and practical guidance for integrating health-sensitive attributes into the regular practices of AFNs as they continue to replicate and evolve in Ecuador and elsewhere."
Leveraging Guatemalan farmers' existing organization around food sovereignty and agroecology for reducing risk of diet- and pesticide-related noncommunicable diseases,"['Batal, Malek']",['N/A'],"['Diet-Related Noncommunicable Disease', 'Farming Communities', 'Food Systems', 'Guatemala', 'Indigenous People', 'Nutrition', 'Pesticide-Related Noncommunicable Disease', 'Sustainable Agriculture', 'Toxicology', 'Women Of Reproductive Age']",221320.0,477583,"Indigenous farmers in Guatemala are disproportionately affected both by diet- and pesticide-related noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). While they grow food on their farms, they often sell the most nutritious products and instead purchase cheap calories in obesogenic markets. Meanwhile, some use pesticides on their own land, and others apply pesticides during seasonal plantation labour. Regrettably, diet- and pesticide-related NCDs compound each others' health impacts, and among mothers, they affect the next generation. For these linked problems, we propose an integrated solution based on existing evidence and practice. Our research will work with farmers who are regaining control over their food and farms by practicing agroecology. An organic farming paradigm based on ecosystem interactions, agroecology has demonstrated links to NCD risk reduction. For example, by increasing production diversity and promoting consumption of own production, it provides nutritious foods and reduces unhealthy purchases. As an organic strategy, it interrupts on-farm pesticide exposure, and by providing a secure livelihood, it reduces labor migration to pesticide-intensive plantations. We deploy implementation research objectives to assess how such linkages can be strengthened in existing agroecology interventions, as well as scaled locally and internationally. We will focus on women of reproductive age, given intergenerational health effects and gender inequalities. Key methods include: a validated tool to evaluate how agroecology's production, social and dietary factors reduce NCD risk; participatory co-learning workshops to understand farmer norms, values and beliefs implicated in health behaviours; and, an action-research communication strategy to integrate evidence-based knowledge into intervention, advocacy and outreach. Local impact is built into our research design, and the project is expected to produce a global impact given the growing interest in agroecology-health linkages."

Starting with Edmonton in 2015, eleven cities in Canada, have adopted the Vision Zero road safety plan to tackle that issue. Unlike the traditional approach of road safety, the Vision Zero approach considers traffic fatalities as preventable, acknowledges that humans make mistakes and roadway system should be designed in ways that those mistakes are not deadly. However, to the best of our knowledge, a rigorous evaluation of the Vision Zero road safety plan in Canada has not been performed. In addition, due to his branding as a ""plan to eliminate all road fatalities"", Vision Zero road safety plan has received many backlashes in the press, especially following a series of deadly road traffic crashes. There is therefore, a need for a rigorous evaluation of the impact of Vision Zero approach in Canada on road traffic fatalities and serious injuries. Using police collision reports, we will apply quasi-experimental designs to provide road safety professionals and decision makers with evidences to support or modify the actual implementation of Vision Zero approach across Canada."

Nearly one in four people will experience a depressive disorder throughout their lifetime and studies show that more than half of children with a depressed parent will develop a mental health diagnoses such as mood, anxiety, and behavioral disorders. Certain factors can impact a child's vulnerability to developing these disorders and the severity of symptoms present. For instance, when a depressed parent goes into remission from depression (i.e.gets better), their children have significantly fewer mental health symptoms than children of parents who remain depressed. Characteristics such as the parent-child relationship, parental stress, social, and school problems can also impact the child's mental health. In this study, we will characterize and compare mental health symptoms and severity, and overall well-being in two groups of children at-risk for depression.The first group will consist of children of parents undergoing medication treatment for MDD in a clinical study; the second group will include children of parents with depression in a population sample.We will aim to identify specific characteristics (i.e.parental remission)in these samples that can help us explain and predict long-term outcomes for these children.We will also offer education sessions regarding depression to children and parents in the clinical sample and monitor the benefits of these sessions on outcome.This study can offer important insight to better understand factors that influence the health of children of depressed parents. Such knowledge is imperative in implementation and timing of interventions and patient education.For instance, in further understanding the influence of the parent's depression status on child health, we can share the urgency of early and aggressive treatment of parental MDD in the clinic and encourage parents to seek, and stick with treament."

To address community informational needs, data were collected that far exceeded the scope of the original grant.  

A program of additional analyses will be conducted, centring around the common themes of social exclusion, erasure, and their impacts on the health of trans people.  Specifically, analyses will cover:  1) demographics; 2) access to health care, mental health care and social services; 3) experiences of violence and suicidality; 4) employment, income and barriers to stable support; 5) interacting effects of racism and transphobia on the experiences of racialized trans people; 6) appropriateness and consistency of sex designations on identity documents, and; 7) family, relationships and social support.

Sex, gender and sexual orientation (which has biological and social components) are often thought of in ways that may be a bit simplistic. For example, sex is thought of as one thing, even though it has different dimensions (chromosomal sex, sexual and reproductive organs, hormones). These may or may not go together within an individual (for example, a woman may not have a uterus). This project examines how researchers can better design their research by being more specific about dimensions of sex or gender. In addition, it explores whether existing and new survey questions on sexual orientation and gender really ""make sense"" to research participants, especially given that younger and older generations may conceptualize their gender and sexuality differently, and that understandings can vary by cultural background. In addition to these issues, this project develops plans for how researchers can better design research and conduct statistical analysis to account for the way that different combinations of demographics or social status indicators may be associated with different health impacts. For example, the effect of living in poverty may differ based on sex/gender, and the health impacts of being a low-income woman cannot be understood by studying the effects of poverty and (separately) the effects of gender, and then just adding these together. While researchers often understand this, they are also often unsure of what to do about that when it comes to analysing data from health surveys. The ultimate goal of this project is to allow researchers in Canada and abroad to produce higher quality research that is both more scientifically valid and more directly relevant to the lives of the people under study."

Different dimensions of sexual orientation - attraction, behaviour and identity - are measured in diverse ways. Behavioural measures of men who have sex with men (MSM) may define this group according to sexual activity during different timeframes (Ever? Past six months?) and may define ""sex"" variably or not at all.  Identity measures may involve scales or categories, including culturally specific categories, or options such as ""unsure"" or ""something else,"" and may combine categories (e.g. gay and bisexual vs. heterosexual). Despite varying measures, researchers and policy makers combine data across studies, formally and informally, assuming that results obtained using one measure are comparable to those that would be obtained using another. This assumption had been found to be invalid for women, but has not been evaluated for men. If it is not, there are serious policy implications. For example, in the consideration of Canadian blood donor deferral criteria, data from studies of gay- and bisexual-identified men have been used to evaluate whether changes should be made to the current policy excluding potential male donors who have had sex with another man, even one time, since 1977. The proposed study draws on population data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Study, which contains multiple measures of sexual orientation not available in Canadian data sets, to assess whether different measures and categorizations of sexual orientation in men will produce similar outcomes in the same large group of adult men. Outcomes include obesity, physical activity, current alcohol and tobacco use, sexually transmitted disease prevalence, and recent sexual risk-taking. Based on a literature review and results of this analysis, recommendations will be made for measuring male sexual orientation in health research studies, and a guide for researchers will be created."

Trans PULSE data have been used in informing debate or changing policies, and in teaching within health professions. However, our 2009-2010 survey data are now dated as well as geographically limited. Moreover, while our team was committed to an intersectional approach, our sample size (n=433) permitted only limited analyses (e.g. a proof-of-concept paper on interacting effects of racism and transphobia, or small-sample analyses of well-being of Aboriginal trans people or the effects of parental support on trans youth). We plan to build off what we have learned about community-based research process and methodology to expand to a national project that would provide health care and social service providers, trans community advocates, and policymakers with relevant province- or community-specific data. We propose an in-person planning retreat and a series of videoconferences to develop a core team to build an expanded Trans PULSE Canada. A 2.5-day planning retreat will be held in London, Ontario, with a small group of strategically selected members who will focus on building team process and identifying methodological, community, geographic and special population expertise needed for the project.

Older adults are particularly susceptible to negative outcomes from climate change related to normal age-related changes, chronic illnesses, increasing rates of disability, as well as other factors, such as inadequate housing, low/fixed incomes and living arrangements. The aim of this project is to better understand and enhance the climate resilience of older adults in Canada. The study will focus on two areas in that have recently experienced climate-related weather emergencies: Montreal, Quebec and Vancouver, British Columbia. We will explore the lived experience of older adults and their family/friend caregivers, as well as clinicians and policy/decision-makers who support this population. We will also develop policy and practice recommendations customized for older adults with these groups. The project will have important implications for policy development, clinical practice, and organizational supports to enhance the climate resilience of older Canadians."

Limited evidence from animal and human studies suggests that exposure to household air pollution and organophosphates (OPs), one of the most common classes of pesticides worldwide, may affect cardiovascular risk. The current project builds on an intervention study already funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency aiming to investigate the impact of clean-burning cookstove use on PM exposure and cardiovascular risk in 250 women living in rural Sichuan, China.  We propose to add biomarkers of exposure to OP pesticides, and novel markers of oxidative stress, inflammation and cellular aging to this study.  We will investigate whether OP exposure is associated with cardiovascular risk, whether exposure to PM and/or OPs increases oxidative stress, inflammation and cellular aging, and whether these factors mediate relations between exposures and cardiovascular risk.  This study will provide unique data on a question with global implications."

Our primary objective is to assess whether the coal ban and new clean heating technology will impact air pollution and indoor temperature or the health of people who live in homes impacted by the policy. This study will provide data that will help policy makers to implement household heating programs that reduce air pollution and its health impacts but also keep homes sufficiently warm. Our results will also help Canada to monitor its progress in meeting environmental goals on mercury.

Research by myself and others shows that exposure to solid fuel smoke increases people's risk of developing cardiovascular disease. In the next five years, I will continue with this area of research with the goal of identifying environmental interventions that can effectively reduce air pollution exposures for large populations and prevent cardiovascular diseases. I will form interdisciplinary teams to evaluate the health and environmental benefits of improved household energy, better housing conditions, and improved transportation. I will develop and assess new tools to assess air pollution exposures and people's vascular function. I will also analyze urine and serum samples to identify key molecular or cellular features that may link pollution exposure and cardiovascular risk from birth to older ages.

Heat may impact on mental wellbeing by affecting our surroundings, how we live, and our safety. Children are particularly vulnerable because their brains are still developing, and they are less able to protect themselves from heat. Exposures to heat and their affects on child mental health are poorly understood, especially in areas of the world that are most affected by climate change like sub-Saharan Africa.

Our international team of researchers and practitioners will combine our knowledge and work closely with local communities to better understand how heat affects child mental health in Accra and Tamale, Ghana. These cities were selected because they are vulnerable to extreme heat due to climate change but also culturally, environmentally, and geographically distinct. We will work alongside leading climate and child health advocates, health and school workers, and community members to understand people's experiences with heat and heat mitigation and the mechanisms through which heat can impact child mental health in our study context. We will measure urban temperatures and test different cooling strategies, and we will enrol school children into a year-long study to understand how heat affects their mental health. 

This research will provide researchers and decision-makers with new information about how heat affects the mental health of children and what strategies may prevent or minimize these impacts. It will especially benefit vulnerable communities, like those living in poverty, by providing valuable information about how to adapt to these changing climate conditions and protect children's mental wellbeing."

Public health measures (e.g., lockdowns) intended to protect older adults have had unintended consequences for those caring for a relative with dementia (RwD). Creating additional vulnerability is a hesitancy to reach out to community supports due to language barriers, cultural and religious beliefs, and stigma surrounding dementia. Our goals are to 1) gain an in-depth understanding of new immigrant, multigenerational, South Asian family caregiving (for a relative with dementia) amidst COVID-19, and 2) to inform future family-centred, healthcare interventions aimed at supporting equity-deserving families during times of crisis. To achieve these goals we will employ a qualitative multiple case study to 1) understand how and why caregiving experiences within multigenerational South Asian families originating from Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, and Sri Lanka were impacted by COVID-19; 2) understand how and why the intersections of ethnicity, gender (identities, roles, relations, institutionalized), age, religion, and culture influence the experience of caring for an RwD; 3) understand how structural, personal, and relational processes changed during COVID-19 and 4) how and why these changes influenced multigenerational family caregiving for an RwD. We will employ purposeful, criterion, and maximum variation sampling to generate data from semi-structured interviews and focus groups with South Asian family caregivers. We will examine secondary data sources including genograms and ecomaps to understand the family structure, roles, caregiving responsibilities, and available formal and informal resources to support their caregiving activities.

The proposed research has three objectives: (i) to generate much-needed Canadian data on the perceptions, views and understandings of women and couples in Canadian IVF programs who have been asked to donate their eggs or embryos for research; (ii) to analyze the potential social and ethical costs associated with egg and embryo donation for research from a feminist perspective, with particular attention to similarities and differences between (a) donors and non-donors, (b) egg donors and embryo donors, and (c) supporters of altruistic donation as compared with those who would prefer a commercialized system; and (iii) to transfer the knowledge gained from Projects 1 and 2 to clinicians, researchers, and policymakers with a view to improving informed decision-making by potential donors and improving existing legislation, regulations, and guidelines governing egg and embryo donation for research. 

In brief, this research will generate Canadian data on the acceptability of egg and embryo research to potential donors.

The combination of scarce availability and strict prohibition against payment has created a black market for human eggs in Canada, and a gray market for eggs in transnational trade. This CIHR Café  will examine the serious ethical and legal consequences of this trade in human eggs, and the potential health implications for providers. Questions to be explored include: Are egg providers fully informed of the potential medical and psychological risks?  Are egg providers less likely to report complications and future health problems when there has been an exchange of money for eggs?   What is the underlying ethical rationale for prohibiting payment for human eggs in Canada? Are financial transactions for eggs that occur over the internet using a non-Canadian agency legal? What are legitimate reimbursable expenses?  Should there be financial compensation for medical injury? Are the young women who become egg providers being exploited?"

Reducing social inequalities between wealthier and disadvantaged communities implies empowerment of the disadvantaged. In the empowerment process, it is crucial to act on the systems that enable/restrict control of such communities over the initiatives impacting their lives. Yet, community empowerment approaches are increasingly restricted to individual capacities, such as abilities to overcome personal challenges.
I will study the empowerment process (or lack thereof) of unaccompanied minors (UMs), in a care provision program in Montreal. UMs are children who migrate without their parents/legal guardians. They mainly escape countries experiencing armed conflicts or oppression. These children are fragile and at risk of being neglected in their host countries. There is a literature gap in Canada about how the services are adopted to the needs of UMs. For the care to be responsive to their needs, their voice should be incorporated into care provision, which can be improved through their empowerment.
Using a qualitative case study methodology, I will run 3 focus group meetings with social, education, and health care providers (n=30); 4 focus groups with UMs (n=30); as well as ask each UM to do photo-voice for 1 month. Photographing their daily experiences will provide additional insight into empowerment. I will structure my focus group guides and analysis on questions regarding political, societal factors (e.g., organizational/institutional procedures) that enable/restrict UMs to exercise power over initiatives impacting their life. The empowerment process of UMs will provide important insights into how power operates within care provision programs which will improve health/social services for disadvantaged groups. It will also help understand how systems can be transformed to become more inclusive, rather than obliging individuals to change to fit in an inequitable system."

Evidence shows minority health care professionals are more likely to work with marginalized populations, and minority patients are more likely to seek care from them, and be satisfied with that care. While numbers of minorities have slowly risen in the health professions, there are still significant problems of recruitment and retention. Little is known about the day-to-day experiences of minority individuals who do enter the health professions, experiences which may shape where and how they practice, how long they stay in the profession and the extent to which they may be able to fulfill the potential for reducing health inequities.

This qualitative study will ask: How do members of minority groups experience working within the health professions in Canada? Thirty to 35 professionals will be interviewed from each of three health professions that differ in history, social status and degree of autonomy: medicine, nursing and occupational therapy. They will be from groups marginalized by race and ethnicity, Indigeneity, class, disability, and/or sexual/gender identity. Interviews will inquire about experiences of belonging and marginality, 'invisible work' such as deciding about disclosures, and strengths such as social networks, community relationships, values and beliefs, and connection with patients.

This research will illuminate potential losses if efforts to increase diversity are not accompanied by efforts to reduce marginalization within the professions. It may inform the recruitment and retention of skilled health professionals, highlighting the resources minority group members bring to the professions as well as challenges they face. Ultimately, the results may help ensure that efforts to diversify health care reach their full potential."

Physical Activity Behaviour in Middle-Aged and Older Canadian Women and Men: An Analysis of the CLSA,"['Beauchamp, Marla K']","[""D'Amore, Cassandra H"", 'Griffith, Lauren E', 'Kuspinar, Ayse', 'Mayhew, Alexandra J', 'Raina, Parminder S', 'Richardson, Julie A']","['Aging', 'Determinants', 'Physical Activity', 'Rehabilitation']",11377.0,469484,"As we age, declines in memory, strength, and overall well-being are often observed. Negative health changes present a significant challenge for Canada's aging population. However, research has shown that increasing physical activity (PA) levels can improve health and overall function as we age while preventing chronic diseases.

Despite the benefits of PA, many older adults do not meet recommended levels. To promote PA among older adults, we need an accurate picture of their current behaviours. Research suggests that among people over 65, specific populations, such as women and those with less education, have an increased risk of insufficient PA. Recently, research has shown the benefits of light-intensity PA, which suggests we should examine a broader range of physical activities than traditionally considered. Less intense forms of PA are especially relevant for older age groups. Our project will use data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging to describe a wide variety of activities separately in Canadian women and men to accurately describe the amount and type of activities performed.

Ongoing trends of low PA levels in high-income countries make understanding what influences PA behaviour critical. A second goal of this work is to explore relationships between possible personal and environmental factors affecting PA in Canadians. We will explore relationships at a single time point and over time. Exploring relationships over time allows us to assess the direction of relationships, helping to fill a gap in research on determinants of PA.

Physical activity is a powerful behaviour that can improve the overall health and wellbeing of Canada's aging population. Describing PA behaviours of specific groups of Canadians more inclusively will help identify those at risk for low PA and factors most related to this vital health behaviour. This work can be used to inform PA promotion efforts and develop new ones better tailored to the needs of Canadian women and men."

COVID-19 was described initially as a respiratory disease. However, it is increasingly recognized as a neurological disease. Furthermore, even if people with Alzheimer disease (AD) do not contract COVID-19, they are at high risk for worsening neuropsychiatric symptoms aggravated by social isolation, psychosocial stressors and disruption in the healthcare system. Definitively, the interaction between COVID-19, AD and a vulnerable healthcare system exposed people with AD and their caregivers to a higher risk of poor health outcomes compared to other population groups. 
While Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have led to the development of new remote applications and platforms for telehealth, these applications and platforms must conform to specific clinical conditions, such as ensuring privacy and security. They must also ensure a patient and their caregivers' ongoing engagement and involvement with the clinician, using these platforms. 
This working group brings together an international clinical and research team with complementary expertise, to work on Alzheimer's care and research. The objectives and expected results are: 
1. Expert consensus on the biomarkers that are still relevant and their implementation in the process of early diagnosis using telehealth. 
2. Identification of the challenges induced by COVID-19 that are related to the acceleration of the use of telehealth for people living with AD and recommendations for better telehealth appropriation by patients and their caregivers. 
3. Implementation guide of new models of care for AD based on telehealth and empowerment of patients and caregivers."

With the aging population, chronic conditions are more frequent and health expenses are exploding.  Studies also show that working-age males meet with greater work absenteeism due to chronic pain, resulting in important socioeconomical loss for the industrialized economies.  Meanwhile, we need to take action to improve the health system as the capacity to support medical care could be affected in a close future by limited federal/provincial budgets reaching a ceiling for health expenses.

In this research program, we propose to develop this crenel within the Quebec Pain Research Network by the joint efforts of research teams from UdeS, UdeM and UMcGill.  We will determine the direct costs in Multidisiplinary Pain Treatment Facilities (MPTFs).  Those data will allow, in the long-term, to perform a cost-effectiveness study based on the level of recovery achieved in the MPTFs.  Overall, this will detail where the costs for LPB management are the greatest and provide insights for explaining potential inequalities.  Accordingly, decision-makers will be able to propose adapted programs either to physicians or the population to balance the health costs while providing improved management and benefits for LBP coping patients."
"Towards understanding the influence of physical activity and food intake timing on determinants of appetite control, body weight and metabolism","['Beaulieu, Kristine']",['N/A'],"['Appetite Control', 'Chronobiology', 'Eating Behaviours', 'Energy Balance', 'Exercise Timing', 'Food Reward', 'Meal Timing', 'Metabolic Health', 'Metabolism']",140000.0,436069,"The role of physical activity and food intake timing in the control of appetite, body weight and metabolism has gained much interest in recent years. This is important because current interventions for obesity and related diseases consider ""what"" and ""how much"" to eat/exercise, but not ""when"". Any combined effects of, or interaction between, physical activity and food intake timing on these outcomes remain unknown, presenting an important gap in knowledge. This Fellowship will test the hypotheses that greater earlier daily physical activity and food intake will be associated with more favourable behavioural, body weight/composition and metabolic outcomes. Food intake timing will consider the daily distribution and eating window. Behavioural outcomes will include daily energy intake and expenditure, subjective appetite, satiety quotient, food reward/preferences, and eating behaviour traits. Metabolic outcomes will include thermic effect of food and glycemia/lipemia. In Work Package 1, associations and interactions between variables will be explored in four datasets of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies in adults and children of both sexes. In Work Package 2, a pilot study will examine the impact of acute exercise and meal timing on the appetite and metabolic responses to a meal in adults. In a 2x2 randomized cross-over design, participants will perform a bout of exercise or rest (meal-only control) and consume a test meal early or late in the day, followed by serial measurements of appetite and metabolism. This Fellowship will increase our understanding of the influence of physical activity and food intake timing in the context of health and prevention of chronic disease. Not only will this research help generate hypotheses to underpin specific mechanisms, it will help design novel interventions and provide insight to formulate recommendations for different populations and health goals. This will have implications for health across Canada and internationally."

This significantly exceeds the Canadian average of 9.2 %. In the community of Igloolik, 64% of Inuit were reported having difficulties in obtaining sufficient food in July 2006 and July 2007. This was the result of several stressors which included: high unemployment, high cost of living, rapid social change, rising costs of hunting and store food, and environmental stresses. In Igloolik and other northern communities, higher prevalence of food insecurity has been reported among female community members. Food insecurity can have serious health implications for women affecting physical, mental and social well-being, and causing increased susceptibility to infection and chronic health afflictions. Research to characterize and understand the vulnerability of Inuit females to food insecurity is essential to promote community well-being and health in a rapidly changing world. Indeed, it has been recognized as a research priority by the Aboriginal Peoples Survey, 2006: Inuit Health and Social Conditions (2008) and Health Canada's (2008) Human Health in a Changing Climate along with Inuit organizations and federal departments. Using a community participatory approach, this research will identify and characterize the key factors determining the vulnerability of Inuit women to food insecurity within the context of significant socio-economic transformation and environmental changes. It will build upon completed baseline climate change food security research in Igloolik, focusing specifically upon female community members. Ultimately, the research outcomes will contribute to work towards enhancing women's adaptive strategies in the face of changing climatic and non-climatic stresses through the identification of local and territorial policy interventions."

Dementia, or declines in cognitive function beyond those expected in healthy aging, is one such age-related disease on the rise in Canada. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a diagnosis often preceding dementia, indicating an individual is at increased risk of developing dementia. The most common cause of dementia is Alzheimer's disease (AD). Dementia symptoms like memory loss and a decreased ability to complete goal-directed behaviours can create significant impairments in social and occupational functioning, limiting one's ability to perform the daily tasks necessary to live independantly in the community.  Currently, there is no cure for dementia, and available therapies can only slow down, not stop or reverse, symptoms. Until a cure is found, research on strategies to prevent dementia and reduce its burden on individuals and communities is greatly needed. Physical activity (PA) has a critical role to play in these strategies. Not only has PA been shown to reduce the risk of developing dementia later in life and progressing from MCI to dementia, but it also helps persons living with dementia maintain their ability to perform daily activities required for independant community living. Despite these benefits, adults aged 65 years and older in Canada report the lowest PA levels of any demographic. Persons with dementia are at increased risk of low PA due to disease-related barriers to PA participation. This research study aims to explore what persons with MCI and AD and their caregivers think about PA as a health behaviour and their perceived barriers, facilitators, and motivators to PA participation. In learning about how persons with MCI and AD perceive and participate in PA, we can develop strategies to increase the use of PA as a health-promoting behaviour to reduce the impact of dementia in Canada."

But not all FSWs are at equal risk of HIV infection and commercial sex differs in how much it contributes to HIV epidemics across countries. Although differences in sexual behaviours and practices among FSWs partially account for variable HIV risk, this explanation ignores differences in human biology (making some people more likely than others to become infected when exposed) and differences in the biology of the HIV virus (making some viruses more infectious than others). It is likely that biology and behaviour act simultaneously on FSWs' HIV risk and HIV transmission at the population level. However, to date, no one has unravelled these biological and behavioural factors to explain why some FSWs experience a greater (and earlier) risk of HIV infection and why some HIV epidemics are driven by commercial sex work while others less so. Our research team received CIHR funding for a behavioural survey (with HIV testing) of FSWs in India, Kenya and Ukraine to estimate their HIV risk before entry into and during their early years in sex work. This baseline survey offers an unprecedented opportunity in three different countries to jointly study the biological and behavioural factors at play, and to start dissecting their complex interactions and how they influence an individual FSW's HIV risk and a country's HIV epidemic.  Thus, we are applying for a planning grant to support a workshop for current and new team members to discuss in person and come up with a clear and feasible research agenda to tackle this complex question. Workshop participants will also brainstorm creative ways to leverage the existing infrastructures of the FSW survey and expand its biological research.

For example, in Sub-Saharan Africa, AGYW aged 15-24 years account for 74% of new HIV infections. One the one hand, while sexual and reproductive health programs for AGYW exist, these programs often use a ""general population"" one-size-fits-all approach without considering the variability in HIV risk among AGYW. On the other hand, most traditional HIV prevention programs for female sex workers (FSW) exclude AGYW engaged in transactional sex and generally only reach women 1-2 years after they self-identify as a sex worker. Because of the divide between ""general population"" AGYW and FSW programs, high risk AGYW and young FSW are often neglected in the current landscape of HIV prevention programs and do not receive the services they need. Indeed, our Transitions study identified high rates of HIV, and sexual and reproductive health vulnerabilities among non-FSW AGYW in Kenya and Ukraine who meet sex partners at sex work 'hotspots' and whose sexual networks overlap with FSW, but who are not reached by FSW programs. The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals articulates the need to ""... ensure universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services, including for family planning, information and education, and the integration of reproductive health into national strategies and programs.""

Sex work is not static; it is constantly adapting to the local context. At times of conflict, the organization, pattern and practice of sex work may change; and as a result, the HIV/STI/HCV risks faced by FSW and their clients may also change. The goal of this project is to examine the impact of the conflict in Ukraine on sex work and the spread of HIV/HCV in the FSW/client populations.

This project will be conducted in Dnipropetrovsk (DNK), 200km from the conflict zone in the eastern region of Ukraine. DNK is a strategic location as frontline Ukrainian forces regularly pass through this city. DNK has also recently become a destination for many internally-displaced people. Moreover, having the highest HIV rates in Europe, a further rise in HIV cases in Ukraine will have important implications beyond its borders. There is very limited data about how conflict affects FSW and their HIV/STI/HCV risks. Building on our previous work which examined early HIV risk among young women and FSW in DNK (a project that was ongoing when conflict first erupted), our team is uniquely positioned to carry out this 5-year study. We will use complementary methods to characterize how conflict shapes FSW's daily lives and influences sex work and HIV/STI/HCV risks, and to estimate the extent to which conflict alters the spread of HIV and HCV among FSW and clients.

The Effectiveness of a Motor and Pre-literacy Community-based Program in Preschool Aged Children,"['Bedard, Chloe T']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,364742,"This study aimed to test the effectiveness of a movement and pre-literacy program designed for children ages 3 to 4 years in Ontario. The program ran for 1 hour/week for 10  weeks and consisted of three components: direct movement skill instruction, child-directed free-play, and an interactive storybook reading circle. There was active involvement of at least one caregiver in the direct instruction and reading components. Families were recruited from local community agencies and were asked to attend at least two study appointments ten weeks apart. Half of the families entered into the program after the first appointment (the experimental group) and the remaining families entered the program after their second appointment (the wait-list control group). Children's movement and pre-literacy skills were assessed during both study appointments. Parents were also asked to complete questionnaires asking about various demographic characteristics and the frequency in which they practice movement and pre-literacy activities at home with their children. The results of the study show that children in the experimental group had significantly greater improvements compared to children in the wait-list control group in movement skills and word and print awareness. Improvements in alphabet knowledge, and parental engagement scores did not differ significantly between groups. The implications of these results are substantial because they provide evidence that participation in a community-based program offering direct instruction in a fun and family-oriented environment has the potential to improve the movement and pre-literacy skills of preschool age children."

However, there is an alarming trend of physical inactivity among children and youth across the globe and this is particularly concerning because PA habits formed during childhood track consistently into adolescence and adulthood. Physical inactivity burdens children and society with a myriad of negative health consequences and increases their future risk of developing physical and mental health illnesses. Children with already existing physical and mental health illnesses, known as multimorbidity, are at a higher risk than their typically developing peers to experience physical inactivity due to their unique health care needs. To support the PA needs of children with multimorbidity, information on their levels of PA and what factors promote or prevent them from engaging in PA is needed; currently this information is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to evaluate the PA behaviours of children with multimorbidity and identify what variables are correlated to their PA. A quantitative analysis of a cohort study of children ages 2 to 16 years with multimorbidity will first be used to measure PA and variables associated with PA. A qualitative study will follow in which semi-structured interviews will be used to explore novel barriers and facilitators of PA engagement among children with multimorbidity and their caregivers. This information will both contribute new knowledge on the health consequences of multimorbidity and be used to inform PA interventions directly targeting children with increased risk of inactivity."
"When You're Taking Care of Someone Else, Who Takes Care of You - Supporting seniors caring for seniors in our community","['Bédard, Michel']","['Gibbons, Carrie E']","['Caregiver', 'Community', 'Support']",3000.0,236861,"The population of Canada is aging rapidly; the number of adults aged 65 and over will approach 5 million by 2011 and may exceed 9 million by 2031. Most of these older adults will develop health issues, but despite these health issues, various levels of government acknowledge that seniors should be supported to 'age in place'. However, to age in place seniors with health issues require assistance, a large component which is provided by family and friends, the so-called 'informal caregivers', many of whom are seniors themselves.  

At this juncture we do not need to debate, or prove further, that caregiving creates considerable strain on a large segment of the senior population. The crucial next steps should be directed at supporting caregivers. From a public health perspective, there have been a number of suggestions to ensure the health of caregivers, including national programs (such as a national respite program) as well as health promotion interventions. This would enable caregivers to best support the care recipients, rather than relying on reactive approaches to restore caregiver health. We will host a Café to discuss these issues with the general public.

The objectives of our Café are to:
-Engage audience members in a discussion about caregiving, including: 
   -the importance of caregiving 
   -how caregiving impacts on the health and well-being of Canadians
-Examine how communities can best support the needs of caregivers 
-Identify knowledge gaps"

Driving cessation among older adults is associated with poor health as well as increased risk of institutionalization and mortality. The research on driving cessation has been focused on the negative health impacts of non-driving with little emphasis on mobility impacts or variables that protect against negative health outcomes. It is now necessary to shift the focus to understanding and supporting older adults who are no longer safe to drive and to reframe this issue in terms of mobility. Our main objectives are: 1) confirm the associations and better understand the temporal relationship between driving cessation and health related outcomes in a large Canadian sample; and 2) identify individual- and contextual-level factors that moderate the relationship between driving status and health-related outcomes among older adults.  Participants will be derived from the Candrive project, a large prospective cohort study of older drivers that collected a host of variables over a 7-year period. Additional measures related to the individual and their environment will be administered to consenting participants already enrolled in the Candrive study.  This study will follow individuals for an additional 4 years in order to observe more cases of driving cessation. This study will identify factors that promote health among older adults after driving cessation and will be used to develop interventions and policies to facilitate a healthy transition to non-driving."

Driving affords independence, forms a central part of identity, and has been associated with high quality of life. Older adults who have ceased driving describe a void in their lives after driving. Driving cessation among older adults is associated with poor health as well as increased risk of institutionalization and mortality.

Using data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), this study will examine driving cessation and factors that buffer its effect on health using a large, representative sample of adults over 45 years old.  Our goal is to examine health and community mobility following driving cessation among older adults, thereby providing data to support smoother transitions to driving cessation through the development of evidence-based interventions for current and former older drivers.

In this project Aboriginal adolescents will create and use comic book style 'graphic novels' to share knowledge about how analyzing and judging health messages in the media can ultimately improve their health. 
Our knowledge sharing will take place in a rural BC school division with a large population of Indigenous students. We will work closely with the local Director of Instruction, Principal of Aboriginal Education, band members and Elders to include the community in our work. Two team members from the university will make three trips to the community. The first step will be to create an Advisory Group including school and community leaders. Next, a group of Aboriginal adolescents, both boys and girls, facilitated by Aboriginal community adults and university based researchers, will learn about advertising and its impact on health, including gender based targetting, as discovered in our research. This writing team will then plan a graphic novel which will present this information in a story including Aboriginal characters, settings, cultural symbols and activities. Once completed, an Aboriginal artist will illustrate the graphic novel which will be presented to the community in hard copies and online at a community event. We will also present teachers with information on how to use these novels in health education classes with all students to further share our research on developing healthy understanding of media messages.

We plan to conduct two inter-related investigations to determine the cause(s) of this outbreak.  

To investigate whether the outbreak is due to epidemiologic factors, such as inadequate housing, poor nutrition and/or lifestyle-associated risk factors, we will conduct two case-control studies.  To investigate whether the outbreak is the result of a more virulent strain of M. tuberculosis, we will sequence the DNA of the outbreak strain and test its virulence in experimental models of disease.

If we find that housing, nutritional or life style factors are strongly associated with the outbreak then public health interventions can be directed toward correcting these problems.  If the bacteria prove to be more virulent than before the outbreak, this will necessitate a very different public health response, potentially including community-wide antibiotic treatment."

Yet important challenges exist in defining and measuring positive aging consistently for research, practice and policy purposes. Rowe & Kahn's (1997) definition of successful aging remains the most commonly used: ""a low probability of disease and disease-related disability, high cognitive and physical functional capacity, and active engagement with life"" (p. 433). As currently defined, successful aging is unachievable for the majority of older adults, because most of them have functional limitations and one or more chronic illnesses. The perspective of older adults themselves is broader, less medical, and more positive than those of researchers, and not dependent upon absence of disability or chronic illness. The purpose of this study is to develop a concept of aging well that integrates the perspectives of older adults. This study relies on three large national databases from North America, namely the Canadian Longitudinal Aging Study (CLSA), the U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS), and the Mexican Healthy Aging Study (MHAS). We propose to construct an index of aging well starting from a review of existing research about older adults' perspectives in Canada, the United States and Mexico. The index will contain health aspects such as difficulties in activities of daily living, and pain, as well as psychological aspects like mood and participation in social activities. The distribution of the index will be presented across North American contexts, and we will examine the factors that encourage aging well. Developing comprehensive measures of positive aging is important to encourage health and social policies that are in line with the priorities of older adults themselves."

The Monitoring Activities of Teenagers to Comprehend their Habits (MATCH) study - Results video,"['Bélanger, Mathieu']",['N/A'],"['Adolescence', 'Cohort', 'Life Course', 'Longitudinal', 'Mental Health', 'Physical Activity', 'Sport']",750.0,414000,"The intricate nature of sport and physical activity behaviour, especially amongst children and adolescents, is an area that many Canadian policy makers, administrators and other sport system stakeholders are trying to better understand, whether to influence health outcomes or bolster club registration. Longitudinal research plays an important role in understanding the factors that influence these changes to inform policy and practice and provoke behavioural change. 

The Monitoring Activities of Teenagers to Comprehend their Habits (MATCH) study is unique in the world. It followed nearly 1,000 children for 8 years, from ages 10 to 17. Participants completed questionnaires administered 3 times per year about their level of participation in specific sports and physical activities, associated motives, and key influences including screen time, sleep, barriers to participation, and life events. 

Longitudinal studies such as MATCH are uniquely designed to document long-term patterns of sport and physical activity participation. Understanding the correlations between childhood participation patterns and those in adolescence, and the impact of life transitions and stressors on participation, can inform policies and programs aimed at increasing and maintaining participation in sport. These range from promotion of a multisport approach in childhood sport programming, to promoting unorganized sport and physical activity as a way for adolescents to manage stress, to program design based on skill development in fun, social environments. Government departments, education institutions, parent groups, sport and physical activity organizations, and communities can all be potential users of the findings. 

Since 2011, MATCH has provided a foundation for insight into the determinants of sport and physical activity behaviours. To date, its results were the subject of ten graduate student theses, 21 published or under review manuscripts, and 60 presentations at academic conferences."

Les programmes de réadaptation cardiaque représentent une intervention efficace pour réduire les taux de mortalité, d'améliorer la qualité de vie et la capacité fonctionnelle des personnes atteintes de maladies cardiovasculaires. Cependant, le niveau d'activité physique des personnes atteintes de maladies cardiovasculaires tend à diminuer une fois le programme de réadaptation cardiaque complété. En effet, il a été démontré que les personnes avaient tendance à arrêter la pratique d'activité physique une fois que la supervision de celle-ci était terminée. Afin d'assurer la préservation des acquis obtenus lors de la réadaptation cardiaque, il est essentiel de maintenir l'activité physique. Incorporer de l'enseignement et des suivis de la pratique d'activité physique à la maison lors du processus de réadaptation cardiaque pourrait aider à soutenir les changements de comportements résultant de la réadaptation cardiaque.

Since the approval of DBS by the FDA in 1997, over 35 000 patients in numerous countries have received DBS with improved quality-of-life in most patients. Many important ethical and social issues arise from DBS in PD. The high costs of the procedures may create challenges for patients, providers, and healthcare systems, including the fact that patients may be placed on wait lists. Meanwhile, securing consent for this last-resort intervention is another area of ethical significance given enthusiastic media response to DBS in PD.  In addition, there has been little examination of the adaptation challenges faced by patients or caregivers after surgical intervention by DBS, for example challenges reintegrating into work or challenges adapting to radically improved motor symptoms.  In spite of the dynamic emergence of neurostimulation and related ethical and social challenges, there are few if any studies identifying and characterizing the ethical and social landscape of DBS drawing on the experiences of patients and caregivers.  In this interview-based study, we will discuss ethical and social issues with patients suffering from PD who have undergone DBS and their caregivers. These perspectives will help to contribute to practice changes in the field of DBS with relation to PD patient care."

Many individuals faced direct or potential threat to their life or health, or significant losses, and families are still living through ongoing adversity and uncertainty as they adapt to new or temporary homes, schools and workplaces. Although many instances of resilience and support within the Fort McMurray population have been seen in the media in the aftermath of the disaster, Alberta Health Services estimated in August 2016 that mental health staff in the city had received 20,000 referrals since May, compared to 1,200 referrals each year. The overarching aim of the present project is to understand the needs of the Fort McMurray population in terms of mental health and to disseminate widely accessible evidence-based tools to alleviate psychological distress and promote resilience. 

The findings from this study will have a direct impact on the mental health of the Fort McMurray community members. It will generate data directly usable by health agencies to learn about the mental health state and the needs for services of the population. Data will be able to guide the development of policies in terms of mental health services attribution, and to support the development of mindful, equitable services tailored to the different members of the community. This will be done via close relationships between the different team members, some of whom have been working together on innovations and knowledge transfer in psychosocial interventions for more than ten years. This project will also be the perfect opportunity to share expertise with Fort McMurray leaders in mental health and decision makers from Alberta Health Services (AHS) and other health agencies."

Although the ostensible goal of these requirements is to educate smokers about the health effects of smoking, they are also an extension of the fear-based messaging that has long been integral to tobacco control campaigns. However, while ethical questions have been raised about the use of fear-based
messaging in tobacco control, to date these concerns have been conspicuously absent from discussions of cigarette packaging. In this project we seek to examine the ethics and effects of new cigarette packaging requirements and proposals in Canada, the USA, Australia and the UK, especially regarding the use of fear as a persuasion tactic to facilitate behaviour change, the implicit tendency to demonize smokers/smoking such messaging entails, and the unintended consequences that may result, especially in light of the growing social gradient in smoking. Following a detailed examination of the legislation in place in each of the four countries, we will conduct ethnographic interviews with smokers on the streets to examine their
response to the new packaging. Importantly, this study will move beyond the experimental laboratory studies and crosssectional
surveys that have dominated research in this area to date, to examine the implications of the new packaging in the context of real-life smoking."

An IPD-MA uses line-by-line data for each patient, in contrast to a typical, aggregate-data meta-analysis which uses only averaged or estimated information from studies (e.g. odds ratios, risk differences, rate ratios, means, proportions, etc.). IPD meta-analyses permit the possibility of detailed statistical analyses including subgroup analyses and the ability to adjust for confounders within and between studies.  However, strikingly, a standardized data analytic approach for IPD meta-analysis does not exist, and has been noted as one of the main drawbacks for IPD meta analyses (after the time and expense needed to assemble the data).
In this work, we propose to two objectives:
1. To evaluate the effectiveness of surgery as a treatment for multiple and extensively drug resistant tuberculosis while accounting for prior patient bias, and the substantial confounding that may exist between and within studies using individual patient data from over 30 studies comprising over 9000 patients.  To address this aim well, we first need to improve on the statistical methodology - which we tackle in Objective 2.
2. To advance biostatistical methodology for the analysis of IPD meta- analyses."

Our plan is to investigate the following aspects of mental health for the overall population, particularly vulnerable groups, and low- and middle- income countries (LMICs): 1) how much mental health symptoms changed from before to during the pandemic. 2) how mental health symptoms changed across different times of the pandemic. 3) which interventions helped people maintain positive mental health during the pandemic.

-What will be our outcomes?
How mental health symptoms changed from before to during the pandemic and across different periods, and whether interventions to improve mental health conditions are helpful or not.

-Who will be in the study? 
Study data from around the world that look at mental health condition of people affected by COVID-19. We searched 10 databases in English and Chinese. From April 2020 to August 2023, we reviewed over 161,000 papers. We found over 500 studies that reported how mental health symptoms changed across the pandemic and over 400 examining different mental health interventions. 

-What will the research team do? 
We will finish cleaning and updating our two systematic reviews. We will (1) update our comparison of mental health before and during COVID-19; (2) evaluate mental health changes across the pandemic; (3) use new evidence to see if mental health interventions are effective; (4) for Objective 1-3, conduct analyses for vulnerable groups and people in LMICs; and (5) conduct a meta-research review of COVID-19 mental health research to identify strengths and areas to improve in planning for ongoing surveillance and disaster preparedness.

-How will people use the results?
Our review will provide unique, critical results that will be used by scholars to better understand how people respond to infectious disease outbreak. It can also be used by governments and health care systems to develop mental health plans for future pandemic."
Optimizing Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Self-Management: Implementing International Evidence-Based Guidelines in Alberta,"['Benham, Jamie L', 'Brennand, Erin A']","['Donald, Maoliosa (Mo)', 'Shouldice, Robyn', 'Vanden Brink, Heidi K', 'Yamamoto, Jennifer']","['Evidence-Based Clinical Practice Guidelines', 'Implementation Science', 'Polycystic Ovary Syndrome', ""Women'S Health""]",100000.0,505322,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormone condition that affects up to 18% of females. People with PCOS can have different symptoms such as irregular menstrual periods or unwanted hair growth and are at increased risk of developing serious complications like high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart disease. 

A group of international PCOS experts have created guidelines on how to diagnose and treat PCOS. These recommendations are based on data published in academic journals and expert opinion. The main strategy recommended for treating PCOS symptoms and for preventing PCOS complications is self-management with lifestyle. Lifestyle management includes exercise, behavioural strategies, healthy eating, and weight management.

The PCOS Guidelines recommend that all people with PCOS should be provided with inclusive, high-quality PCOS tools and resources. A recent survey in Alberta found that less than 10% of people with PCOS have been provided with education or resources about how to manage their chronic condition, and there is a lack of reliable resources available to guide PCOS self-management. Recent studies have found that there are considerable levels of misinformation related to PCOS care being distributed across social media channels. There is considerable need to develop patient-centred self-management tools for PCOS for use in Canada.

The overall goal of this research program is to develop inclusive, accessible, and reliable self-management tools co-created by people with PCOS for people with PCOS. The content in these tools will be based on the evidence recommended in the PCOS International Guidelines for lifestyle management. 

Through this proposed research, we aim to:

1)Determine the experiences of people with PCOS living in Alberta with current resources for PCOS self-management.

2)Co-create high-quality, credible, inclusive, accessible resources and tools for PCOS self-management with people who have lived experience with PCOS."
Manitoulin Island First Nations' Concepts of Healthy Relationships,"['Bennett, Beaudin A']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1300.0,364898,"In a recent collaboration with a Manitoulin Isl. First Nations (FN) health services center, intimate partner violence (IPV) was identified as a community-wide issue associated with acute injuries and chronic issues such as anxiety and depression. Although data on IPV in Indigenous communities is lacking, provincial and regional studies show Indigenous women experience higher rates of IPV, when compared to non-Indigenous women. Despite this, little research has focused on IPV in Indigenous communities and, in particular, little research has been devoted to Indigenous women's perspectives on IPV. I suggest that, for Indigenous women living on-reserve, the most appropriate way to better understand this issue is through a community-based participatory research, strengths-based approach, one designed to break the cycle of IPV and move toward the restoration of balance in relationships, according to Indigenous worldviews. Working with Debajehmujig Storytellers (an Indigenous theater company on Manitoulin Isl.) and Manitoulin Isl. FN health services centers and community members, we used a visual arts research method to stimulate discussion among Indigenous women on strengths they see in their communities regarding healthy relationships and families, strengths that might counteract IPV. These discussions occurred once a week; each focus group addressed a different theme (i.e. resilience, balance, responsibility) selected by participants. The themes informed visual arts shared by participants and guided the conversation of the focus group. Each session was filmed and videos that shared the stories and perspectives of the participants were created. The research contributed to a greater understanding of IPV, from the perspectives of Indigenous community members. In turn, we hope that this will increase awareness and dialogue in the community and serve as a step toward community-based solutions to IPV and understanding the role of primary care in addressing IPV."
Estimating risk of alcohol harms in priority populations using Canada's Guidance on Alcohol and Health and a target trial emulation approach,"['Benny, Claire A']",['N/A'],"['Alcohol Use', 'Chronic Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Low Risk Drinking Guidelines', 'Mental Health', 'Social Determinants Of Health', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Target Trial']",135000.0,492590,"This research aims to understand the impact of Canada's new alcohol guidelines on different population groups. Despite the fact that alcohol is a major contributor to health problems in Canada, a large portion of Canadians continue to drink. The new guidelines advise Canadians to lessen alcohol consumption due to emerging evidence of its harmful effects, even in moderate amounts. While ongoing research focuses on the general population, this study focuses on priority populations such as individuals with lower socioeconomic status and those with mental health conditions and includes considerations for sex/gender. These groups are known to be more vulnerable to alcohol-related harms despite drinking less than others.
The research uses a novel approach called target trial emulation, which is essential when conducting ethical experiments on alcohol's effects. It seeks to minimize biases and provide valid insights. The study utilizes data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), which includes a diverse sample of adults. Participants are categorized based on their alcohol consumption risk levels as per the new guidelines. The study will analyze how following these guidelines impacts the incidence of major chronic diseases in different populations, including men and women, those with varying socioeconomic statuses, and those with or without mental health conditions.
This research is crucial for understanding whether Canada's new alcohol guidelines provide protection against health risks in priority populations, considering the differences in how alcohol affects various groups. Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to more equitable policies for promoting safe alcohol behaviours and reducing health disparities among Canadians."

The proposed project associated with this application intends on working with a research team composed of Indigenous and allied scholars and service providers to develop a stress-reducing intervention grounded in Indigenous culture. The intervention will also be developed with Indigenous Elders, other healing practitioners and study participants to include stress relaxation techniques and educational strength-based components building on Indigenous knowledge and cultural practices. It will be implemented in Thunder Bay and Toronto, Ontario, where 40 women will be recruited for each site of which 20 are living with HIV and 20 without HIV. Our primary objective will be to compare stress levels by measuring substances (i.e., biological markers of stress) in the saliva of women with and without HIV before starting and after 6 months of practicing the intervention every two weeks. We are also aiming to improve self-esteem, self-determination, quality of life, HIV health outcomes, and HIV and STBBIs prevention and care knowledge which will be measured through questionnaires and discussion groups. Using the RE-AIM framework, we will also evaluate the intervention for an additional 3 months after the study is completed in order to assess its feasibility and utility in a real world setting. The overall purpose of this project is that the intervention developed is effective at reducing stress levels and improving the overall wellbeing of Indigenous women and that service providers are able to incorporate it within their programming for Indigenous women"

Fifty-eight Indigenous women live at the Elm Centre and many were directly impacted by the sixties scoop. As a result, the women possess different levels of cultural knowledge and have gone on different healing journeys which may involve substance use. The objectives are for Indigenous women who are sixties scoop survivors to begin their healing journey by: 1) increasing their cultural knowledge through teachings and engagement with a Knowledge Keeper, 2) having other supports and resources they require identified, and 3) participating in a Full Moon Ceremony. Healing circles will be facilitated on a weekly basis for 8 weeks. Two 8-week cycles will be held with circles lasting at least 2 hours plus additional time to share in a meal. The circles will include 6 to 10 women. The participants of the circles will receive specific gifts at each circle to build their medicine bundles such that those who may not be ready for ceremony possess gifts that they can use for their healing journey. One of the desired outcomes of the project is to create a ""guideline"" for incoming clients and service providers to prepare for a Full Moon Ceremony. A necessary resource to ensure consistency with regards to ceremonial practices and meeting client expectations. Another outcome is to assess wellness and cultural knowledge through group discussions with the women completing a cycle. They also hope to identify other resources desired by the women beyond the Full Moon Ceremony which may involve other ceremonies or more mainstream health and support services. Finally, they would like to increase the understanding of clients and staff around the practice of ceremony and harm reduction."

"Use of anti-infectives, and more specifically antibiotics, during pregnancy: Risks and benefits for the mother and child","['Bérard, Anick']","['Blais, Lucie', 'Rey, Evelyne E', 'Santos, Fabiano']","['Administrative Databases', 'Anti-Infective Drugs', 'Antibiotics', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Outcomes', 'Quebec Pregnancy Registry']",100000.0,173085,"Although anti-infectives including antibiotics are amongst the most frequently used drugs during pregnancy, there is no agreement on the absolute risks and benefits for the mother and her child. Antibiotics are indicated for the outpatient treatment of prevalent pregnancy complications such as urinary tract infections and bacterial vaginosis, which are themselves associated with a high incidence of pelvic inflammatory disease, premature rupture of membranes, preterm labour/chorioamniotitis, premature deliveries, low birth weight (LBW) infants, and foetal mortality. Given that indications for antibiotics use during gestation are themselves increasing the risk of adverse perinatal outcomes, it is pivotal to determine the risk/benefit ratio of anti-infectives, more specifically antibiotics use during pregnancy for the mother and the child. The objectives of this study are to quantify the associations between anti-infectives, and more specifically antibiotics exposure during pregnancy and the risk of prematurity, low birth weight, small for gestational age babies, and major congenital malformations, considering the indications for use. Data will be obtained from the Quebec Pregnancy Registry (QPR) that includes data on all pregnancies in Quebec from 01/01/1998 to 31/12/2008. The Registry was built with the linkage of three administrative databases: the Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec, MedEcho, and ISQ. The results of this study will give evidence-based data on the effect of gestational use of anti-infectives, and more specifically antibiotics, on the health of the mother and her child, taking into account the indication for use."
Post-Fall Decision Making among Older Women Living in Continuing Care Retirement Communities: A Mixed Methods Study,"['Bergeron, Caroline D']",['N/A'],"['Continuing Care Retirement Communities', 'Decision Making', 'Falls', 'Gerontology', 'Health', 'Health Communication', 'Independence', 'Older Women', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quantitative Methods']",93333.0,272561,"Each year, one in three individuals over the age of 65 will experience a fall. Women experience more falls than men and are three times more likely to be hospitalized for a fall-related injury. The incidence of a fall can change how a woman perceives herself and how she maintains her health and independence. These falls can trigger important decision making among older women, yet little is known about the post-fall decision-making processes. This study proposes to examine post-fall decision making among older women living in continuing care retirement communities to better understand: 1) the types of decisions made by older women after they experience a fall; 2) the content and sources of health information involved in the post-fall decision making; and 3) the influence of individual factors, such as the women's preferences regarding care, on the decision-making process. The findings of this study will contribute to a greater understanding of what happens when an older woman experiences a fall and may help improve future fall prevention programs."

In a representative sample of more than 23,000 Canadians aged 18 years and older, the rate of child sexual abuse, physical abuse, or exposure to domestic violence was found to be 32%. Victimization is associated with a host of negative short- and long-term mental and physical health consequences, such as internalizing and externalizing problems, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, chronic pain and sexual revictimization. Although several studies have examined the consequences of childhood and adolescent victimization, progress in this area is hampered by important methodological limitations, such as the use of clinical samples, cross-sectional designs, and adult retrospective reports of victimization. Further, very little work has focused on sexuality, beyond sexual risk-taking. The proposed longitudinal study will overcome prior methodological limitations by examining the effect of different types of victimization assessed at age 14 on the sexual health of adolescents aged 14-17 over a three-year period. In their high school classrooms, 4,000 community participants will complete standardized measures at baseline as well as one and two years later. We hypothesize that victimization assessed at Time 1 will significantly predict worse sexual health outcomes at two- and three-year follow-ups. Our interdisciplinary team of psychologists, sexologists and physicians specialized in victimization, adolescence, and sexuality is well positioned to carry out the proposed research, which has direct implications for the health of Canadians. Findings will generate novel longitudinal data concerning the relationship between childhood and adolescent victimization and sexual health, and will contribute to the identification of factors to be targeted in prevention and intervention programs aimed at improving adolescents' sexual health."

Contrary to popular belief, psychological problems such as anxiety, depression, aggression and hyperactivity are common in children and often persist throughout childhood and into adolescence. When searching for the causes of children's psychological difficulties, researchers have often focused on parent-child relationships. We now know that while poor parent-child relations do contribute to the development of psychological problems in children, not all children exposed to non-optimal parenting develop psychological difficulties. This suggests that in addition to parenting, other factors influence children's mental health. In particular, children's biological and mental characteristics could make some children more vulnerable to the effects of low-quality relationships with their parents and at-risk for developing psychological problems, while others might be protected against such problems. This project focuses on two factors that might influence children's mental health in addition to parenting.  First, the quality of children's sleep will be studied as an important aspect of children's biological functioning.  Second, mental abilities that enable children to plan and establish future goals (called ""executive functioning"") will be studied.  A group of 250 children who have been followed by our research group since birth will be invited to participate in the current project when they are in Grades 1 to 4. We will use tests and questionnaires to examine their relationship with their parents, the quality of their sleep and their executive functioning to determine how these factors interact with each other to determine mental health status. The results of this study will help us to better understand the development of psychological problems in childhood and how we might detect problems early in life so that they can be treated."

Recent international commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have created funding opportunities to implement adaptation programs in low and middle income countries. Allocation of these funds requires evidence that interventions are feasible and successful. Despite the magnitude of the adaptation challenge, there is a lack of evidence-based research to support access to funding. There is widespread recognition of particularly high vulnerability among Indigenous peoples, yet these populations have been largely neglected in literature and discourse on climate change. Working with Indigenous community partners in Amazonian Peru and southwestern Uganda, the IP-ADAPT project is the first research initiative to explicitly evaluate adaptation interventions to promote climate change adaptation in the context of Indigenous health. The research team consists of international leaders in climate change adaptation, Indigenous health research, and health policy, and the project is guided by an integrated knowledge translation model. The research will contribute to the development of a sparse but critically needed evidentiary base to support policy formulation and funding allocation for adaptation among Indigenous peoples."

However, there is little data collected about the Métis, particularly data that is culturally relevant. As a result, there are few insights in to what factors make Métis Citizens healthy as a population, leading to disparities in the provision of health services. In partnership with the Métis Nation of British Columbia (MNBC), this research will utilize two data sources that collect information on Métis people. One is Ta Santii, a report created in partnership with the McCreary Centre Society using data from the Adolescent Health Survey. The second is Taanishi Kiiya, a population health report created by MNBC using Provincial Health Services data.   As the scope of both of these reports is wide, analysis will be tailored to discover what factors promote positive mental wellness for Métis youth in the province, particularly cultural or social factors. 
Using a technique called logistic regression in the framework of causal inference, I will complete modelling and analysis that determines what different factors may contribute to improved mental wellness. The results of this research will not only provide insights in to the health of Métis youth in the province, but will also provide desperately needed data to MNBC and the wider research community. This moves forward the necessity for further Métis specific research. As MNBC is a partner in this research, the research will be overseen by the Métis Data Governance Committee and this will significantly increase Métis sovereignty over research."

Avian influenza viruses in particular have generated global health concern because of their ability to cause severe disease in humans. Avian strains are also capable of combining with human strains, which allows new influenza viruses to evolve. The emergence of a new influenza virus with improved human-to-human transmission is of concern because it could cause the next global pandemic. The public health risks posed by avian influenza are particularly high in Bangladesh, where high population densities and expanding poultry production industries are bringing humans and animals in closer contact. However, there is currently limited understanding of the seasonality and transmission patterns of influenza in human and poultry populations in Bangladesh. To address this critical research gap, my doctoral project aims to evaluate human and avian influenza transmission to better understand risk of pandemic emergence and opportunities for control in Dhaka, Bangladesh. This project will bring together routinely collected datasets from laboratories, hospitals, and veterinary programs in Bangladesh. Using these data, I will implement innovative statistical, mathematical, and epidemiological models to (1) characterize the seasonal patterns of influenza in human and poultry populations; (2) track influenza transmission at the human-poultry interface; and (3) simulate the impact of influenza control strategies. Plausible control strategies, such as human vaccination, poultry vaccination, and improved biosecurity practices, will be defined in collaboration with stakeholders in Dhaka through workshops and meetings. The proposed research will provide researchers and global public health experts with novel tools to make informed and actionable decisions to control potential influenza threats and support human and animal well-being."

Women are also more scared of breast cancer than they are of heart disease, yet feel they have little control over whether they will develop breast cancer or not. The Red Dress campaign was developed to try to raise awareness of heart disease risk in women, but it has not reached as many women as the Pink Ribbon campaign for breast cancer. It is therefore possible that the Pink Ribbon campaign has a more powerful effect on women and results in greater perceived risk of breast cancer than heart disease. This research will investigate how these two campaigns are represented in the media. We will also investigate how the two campaigns influence women from various socioeconomic, education, and cultural groups. We will use surveys and experiments to test the hypotheses that the Pink Ribbon campaign, which has greater exposure and reach through corporate endorsements, influences not only perceptions of breast cancer but indirectly influences risk perception of heart disease. The experiments will test how health messages are processed outside of our conscious awareness. This is important to do because our gut reactions to media can guide behaviour, even if we are not necessarily aware that they are doing so. This research will help inform health promotion efforts. The results will be of interest to both researchers and practitioners who work to prevent heart disease in Canada and who attempt to increase behaviours such as physical activity that have been shown to help prevent both heart disease and breast cancer."
Do nonstigmatizing images of people living with obesity elicit the desired response? Automatic affective responses and related stigmatization.,"['Berry, Tanya R']","['Hussey, Brad', 'Myre, Maxine']","['Automatic Affective Associations', 'Obesity', 'Physical Activity']",69187.0,418521,"Attempts to change health behaviours are usually based on the assumption that people take the time to think through a behavioural choice, weighing their attitudes toward it, before eventually reaching a decision. The problem is this approach doesn't consider people's ""gut reaction"" - the immediate feeling they have when they encounter something, disgust for example, or a spontaneous feeling of warmth toward someone. These gut reactions are very important for behaviours like physical activity. They can also be related to how we treat other people. People living with obesity are often discriminated against, which is a barrier to their health. Physical activity is often associated with weight loss, yet is not inclusive of those with larger bodies. At the same time, media representations of obesity often show stigmatizing, stereotypical images of people living with obesity. This can lead people to make assumptions about a person based just on their body size or shape. Obesity Canada is trying to decrease stigmatization and improve the lives of persons with obesity. They have created nonstigmatizing images that are free for use in health promotion and research. However, it is not known if these images have the desired effect of reducing bias against people living with obesity. The automatic response to them might be negative, and therefore have the opposite effect by increasing bias. The purpose of this research is measure people's gut reactions to these images and to see if they are related to negative bias toward people living with obesity. The groups included in the study will include people living with obesity, physical activity professionals, and the general public. By doing this research we will know more about how we can influence bias toward people living with obesity. It is important to do this before health promotion or other interventions are created."
Affective heart disease and physical activity messages for women,"['Berry, Tanya R']","['Norris, Colleen M', 'Oliphant, Tami']","['Automatic Affective Associations', 'Heart Disease', 'Messages', 'Physical Activity']",110000.0,368969,"A lot of time and money is spent to create messages that try to educate women about heart disease. These messages also give information about heart healthy behaviors like being more active. Most of these messages talk about the health benefits of exercise and suggest things like setting goals to help women be more active. Women with heart disease tell us the messages can make them feel guilty, that they caused their own sickness. The emotions we feel are very important and influence what we choose to do. Researchers have suggested that messages should deliberately try to make women feel good about being active, even if they already have heart disease. This research will try to do that. The first thing we will do is create messages that try to make women with and without heart disease feel good about being active. We will ask women to comment on the messages and will change the messages based on the comments. We will test if the new messages make women feel better (for example, happier or less stressed) than messages that talk about why being active is good for you. Those messages also ask women to set goals and that can be hard for them. We will see if the women who read the emotional messages move more compared to women who read the other messages. This research tests what women think about existing heart disease prevention messages. If the new messages cause positive emotional responses then maybe heart healthy behaviours will also change. This research may impact the health of women with and without heart disease because physical activity is good for most people. If successful, this study design can also test messages about other things like smoking and diet. It might seem like a small change in how heart disease is talked about, but many people and groups can use the results. In that way, many people can be positively affected."

Wind and topography affect pollution patterns over cities. Traffic pollution declines rapidly as we move further from roads.
Yet, we are often unaware of pollution spatial patterns, because air quality is only recorded at few locations, and a single air quality health index (AQHI) is issued for a whole city to tell us if the pollution level is dangerous for our health. AQHI does not tell us where pollution is higher or lower, and where it is safer for us to walk, jog, or bike.
Working with Health Canada, we measured air pollution across Calgary and analyzed how air quality varies from place to place. Medical doctors and health researchers have used these results to study the association of air pollution with certain diseases.
Through this project we will produce maps that show air pollution levels over pedestrian and bike paths. These maps will be posted on the web, printed and distributed, so people can chose to walk where the air is less polluted and breathe better air while they walk. Our maps will be simple and easy to understand for old people, recent immigrants, and people with low literacy.
We will also develop local measures of air pollution that can be integrated into indices such as walkscore, so that the score will be higher where the air is cleaner, and lower where it is more polluted.
Finally, we will consider the use of sensors that people can wear like a watch or place in their backyard. Volunteers can send us the data they collect. We plan to use these data to measure and map pollution all over the city at different times of the day, for example during rush hour vs. non-rush hour, to make better smart walk recommendations. We will work on a smartphone app that allows users to receive real-time pollution information where they are, and suggest alternative routes if exposure is high where they are"
The most effective team building strategies for facilitating perceptions of task and social cohesion in beginner exercisers.,"['Bertram, Robyn']",['N/A'],"['Adherence', 'Cohesion', 'Exercise', 'Satisfaction']",17500.0,226208,"It has been extensively documented that exercise leads to improvements in both physical and psychological wellness (Russel et al., 1995). However, 53.5 percent of Canadians over 12 years of age are considered physically inactive (Luo et al., 2007). Also, dropout rates within the first 3 to 6 months are reported to be as high as 50 percent in those attempting to live a healthier lifestyle through exercise programming (Lenchner & De Vries, 1995). 

Group dynamics researchers have suggested methods to significantly increase exercise adherence and satisfaction within exercise groups by the implementation of team building strategies (Spink & Carron, 1993). These interventions work by increasing perceptions of task and social cohesion among exercisers within a fitness group. This presents a novel way to combat the high dropout rates seen within the first months of those starting a new program. However, these studies have not investigated which team building strategies are the most effective at increasing task and social cohesion in the beginner exercise population (those with less than 3 months experience).     
Therefore, I plan to utilize the conceptual model developed by Spink and Carron (1993) to isolate and implement three popular team building strategies (developing distinctiveness, enhancing communication, and encouraging or recognizing sacrifice behaviours) within four circuit training (i.e., station to station set up) fitness classes (one group being allocated as a control), which will be comprised of beginner exercisers. The ultimate goal will be to determine which of the three interventions is more effective in increasing task and social cohesion and if enhanced perceptions of cohesion result in increased adherence and satisfaction among beginner participants. The goal of the proposed research is to indentify novel ways of decreasing beginner exercisers' dropout rates and facilitate their transition into living a healthier, proactive lifestyle."

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about treatment options for Indigenous people in Canada; despite comparable rates of depression and anxiety to those of non-Indigenous decent, there are very few sensitive and culturally appropriate treatment options for Indigenous Canadians who may be suffering from elevated symptoms of depression and anxiety, as most these existing interventions have almost exclusively been developed by or with individuals of the majority culture (White; middle class; Judeo-Christian). This is problematic, as this cultural mismatch between how the intervention is designed and traditional Indigenous elements and knowledge dissuades Indigenous patients from engaging with said treatments. Mindfulness-based interventions have gained tremendous popularity in the last two decades, and have been shown to improve mild-moderate symptoms of depression and anxiety.  Fortunately,  Eastern and holistic influences of mindfulness-based interventions make them more amenable for adaptation for Indigenous patients. In this investigation, the research team will use a community-oriented approach to a) adapt a preexisting mindfulness-based intervention for use among Indigenous university students, and b) pilot-test the initial efficacy of this intervention to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety among a small sample of Indigenous students, and c) outline a model for adapting existing psychological interventions to make them culturally sensitive and specific for Indigenous peoples in Canada. We hope at the end of this project, an additional, efficacious, and sensitive treatment option will exist for Indigenous students who are looking for ways to supplements traditional ways of dealing with distress."

Next, we will link objective environmental variables collected by the Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research Consortium to the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging dataset and then determine to degree to which urban environmental factors (e.g., pollution levels, access to green space and walkable neighborhoods) predict the amount of cognitive aging experienced at the individual level. Finally, we will evaluate whether individual-level variables (e.g., demographic factors, health status, health behaviours) modify the association between the environment and cognitive aging. Overall, the proposed study will shed light on the nature of cognitive aging and the role of the environment in either mitigating or accelerating cognitive aging."

Research in the U.S. has shown that Latino gay men are affected by social vulnerabilities (including social determinants of health), homophobia, gender expectations (masculinities), race and class intersections. Evidence suggests that Latino gay men immigrate to the United States or Canada as a strategy to deal with the highly gendered, homophobic and heteronormative social pressures prevalent in Latin American societies. In fact, hundreds of Latin American men claim Canadian protection, applying as sexual orientation refugees every year.  Studies have found that members of this cohort can find that sexual freedom in this new environment carries challenges such as marginalization, individual's anonymity, as well as isolation, language and cultural barriers. In conjunction with the social determinants of health, these affect the safe sex practices of Latino gay men immigrants. There is a great need for qualitative research to comprehend the 'sexual experiences' which comprise the metaphoric and material 'journey' of Latino gay men immigrants. Using Queer theory, sexual stories and body maps as theoretical frameworks, I will interview 12 to 18 Latino gay men immigrants who have been in Canada for no less than 1 year and no more than 5 years. In addition, in order to make sure the narratives of Latino HIV positive are heard, at least 4 to 6 of the recruited participants will be HIV positive. The interview will employ a semi-structured format. Narratives will be transcribed, coded and analyzed. Body maps will be drawn based on participants' narratives. Research results and body maps will be presented as  knowledge transfer/dissemination activities to communicate the results to the community, academia, social services providers and key stakeholders."

They were considered a priority group for the pH1N1 vaccine and were among the first group to be offered the vaccine. Given the increasing attention placed on vaccine safety by the public and media, and the relative newness of the pH1N1 vaccine, an understanding of the knowledge, attitudes and behavior around H1N1 influenza immunization in pregnant women is necessary to better inform public health planners and to develop immunization materials that address the specific concerns of this population.  Our research proposes to determine knowledge, attitudes and behavior about influenza immunization in pregnant women that may affect vaccine acceptance and uptake."

While the degradation of socially, culturally, and economically invaluable fisheries has impacted coastal communities throughout the world, renewed local involvement in coastal management has the potential to foster community well-being by a variety of means.  Drawing on social well-being and ecohealth approaches and informed by indigenous research perspectives, this participatory, community-based study characterises the relationships between past, present, and envisioned eulachon management institutions and community well-being on the central coast of British Columbia, Canada.  A situational analysis combining grey literature, interviews, and community-based process is used to examine how the re-integration of traditional aboriginal knowledge into local eulachon stewardship is understood to support community well-being, by whom and for whom."
The association between depression severity and cardiac risk factors among women referred to a cardiac rehabilitation and prevention clinic,"['Bhardwaj, Meena']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],871.0,346657,"Depression co-morbid with cardiovascular disease is associated with higher rates of morbidity and mortality, with studies suggesting that this is especially true among women. Despite this, depression continues to be under-recognized and under-treated in this population. This study examined depressive symptoms and their relationship to cardiac risk factors among women referred to a unique women's only cardiac rehabilitation and primary prevention program in Toronto, Ontario. Data for 1, 075 women referred to the program between 2004 and 2014 were examined. Women were categorized by depression severity based on baseline scores on the Beck Depression Inventory - 2nd edition (BDI-II), a standard depression screening instrument. Socio-demographic variables, quality of life (QoL) and cardiac risk factors were compared across depression severity categories using BDI-II cutoff scores. The prevalence of antidepressant use among those with moderate to high depressive symptoms was assessed at baseline as an indicator of under- or untreated depression. Overall, 38.6% of women scored above the BDI-II cut-off for depression; 23.6% in the moderate or severe range. Socioeconomic status decreased with increasing depression severity. Depression severity was strongly associated with worse QoL scores. Body mass index increased with depressive severity, as did the percentage of individuals with below target age predicted fitness. Only 39% of women in the moderate or severe BDI-II groups were taking antidepressants. This study demonstrates a significant prevalence of unrecognized and under-treated depression among women with, or at high risk of developing, cardiovascular disease."
A innovative mHealth platform for monitoring and responding to food insecurity and mental health impacts of climate change in the Canadian North,"['Bhawra, Jasmin']",['N/A'],"['Climate Change', 'Environmental Determinants Of Health', 'Food Insecurity', 'Indigenous Health', 'Mental Health']",140000.0,411664,"This research respectfully involves Indigenous communities.
The effects of climate change have been increasingly experienced across Canada, with people living in rural and remote areas being the most vulnerable to the adverse effects of warming temperatures and extreme weather events. Indigenous food systems are especially sensitive to climate change because Indigenous Peoples have a strong connection to the land. As a result, even small changes in the environment can have a big impact on Indigenous Peoples' food security. Emerging research shows a link between adverse weather events, anxiety, and depression. However, there is a need to better understand how the long-term effects of climate change influence mental health through its detrimental impact on food systems. This project aims to engage Indigenous communities to identify the complex relationships between climate change, food insecurity, and mental health, as well as adaptation strategies necessary for improving food insecurity and mental health status.
The project will use the SMART Platform, an innovative mobile health (mHealth) platform developed at the DEPtH Lab, Johnson Shoyama Graduate School of Public Policy (two campus School at the Universities of Saskatchewan and Regina). Community members in northern Canada will have an opportunity to be citizen scientists in this project, engaged both in-person and remotely using citizen-owned smartphones. 
The project will involve Indigenous communities that have existing collaborations with the DEPtH Lab and the Indigenous Peoples' Health Research Centre. Smartphone-based data collection will allow continuous engagement with citizen scientists over a two-year period to capture rich population health behavioural, social, and environmental data in real time. Ultimately, this research will provide a voice to Indigenous communities who have the greatest risk of adverse climate change impacts by utilizing smartphones as a tool of equity."

Approximately half of the First Nations population in Saskatchewan is under 19 years of age. First Nations youth are at high risk for developing long-term health related problems, being hospitalized, being incarcerated, committing suicide, and becoming infected with HIV. Past health research and health systems efforts have focused on Western knowledge in the effort to reduce the individual's risks and to reduce costs to the health care system. The time has come to reconsider how we engage First Nations youth in learning about their meaning of health and ways of knowing from a First Nations lens. Oral and visual methods such as winter counts may lead to improved health individually and collectively through better health policies, more effective research, and perhaps creative health delivery models. This research will involve be open to mutual capacity building and co-research in the pursuit of meaningful and innovative approaches to understanding and achieving health for First Nations youth."
Compiling educator perspectives on the limitations of Indigenous health curricula in heath professional programs at Dalhousie University,"['Biderman, Maya B']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1300.0,383210,"There is a systematic failing in health care across Canada when it comes to the treatment of Indigenous peoples, which stems, in part, from a lack of curricula that teach competencies related to the provision of culturally safe care. It is crucial that health professional programs address the knowledge gaps in educational curricula to allow future professionals to adequately serve Canadian Indigenous populations. 

At Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, research was undertaken to identify current Indigenous health content in the nursing, medicine, dentistry, social work and pharmacy programs. The overarching purpose was to understand the perspectives of faculty in the aforementioned programs towards the effectiveness of the current content in preparing students to deliver culturally competent health care to Indigenous Canadians. 

Semi-structured interviews were conducted in 2016-17 with 32 faculty and staff from these five programs. Verbatim transcripts were subjected to thematic analysis, which identified the insufficiencies of current curricula in preparing future professionals to work with Indigenous peoples. 

By improving the educational experiences to which students are exposed before entering the workplace, students will be better informed of the health and history of the Indigenous peoples they will be working with, and will be better able to properly address Indigenous health care needs. 

The results from this project are helping to inform the design of a new Indigenous health and wellness course being piloted for faculty and students in the nursing, medicine and dentistry programs at Dalhousie in 2018. The results will be shared with other Canadian universities."
Sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections in transgender people in Canada: a bio-behavioural survey,"['Bigio, Jacob']",['N/A'],"['Bio-Behavioural Surveys', 'Epidemiology', 'Sexually Transmitted And Blood-Borne Infections', 'Transgender People']",105000.0,495456,"Infections that are spread by having sex or through contact with blood affect different groups in the population differently. In Canada, groups at high risk of these infections include people who inject drugs; gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men; Afro-Caribbean and black people; and indigenous people. Research from other countries suggests that transgender people are also at high risk of these infections but very little data from Canada is available on this topic. This survey aims to change that. The survey will recruit people who describe themselves as transgender from 12 primary care and outpatient clinics in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec that have experience working with transgender people. These provinces have been chosen as they have the most developed systems of healthcare catering to transgender people. The study will aim to recruit 200 transgender people at each location, for a total of 2,400. Study participants will have blood tests for HIV, syphilis and hepatitis B and C and will be asked a series of questions about their sexual behaviour, including whether they use condoms when they have sex, as well as about whether they inject drugs and share injecting equipment such as needles. Participants will also be asked whether they find it difficult to get tested for these infections or to get treated for them once they have been diagnosed. Because the survey asks very personal questions and about drug use that may be illegal, it will be entirely anonymous. Participants will be given a small amount of money for their time. The survey will give important new information on the proportion of transgender people in these three provinces who have the four infections, which will enable the healthcare system to better target resources to this group. It will also identify whether there are any specific challenges that transgender people face in accessing care for these infections, which will enable changes to be made to facilitate their access."

Specifically, this research will focus on the intersection between planning practice and the lived experience of community dwelling people with Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). This research aims to explore the influence that the environment has on the health and well-being of this group through understanding their experiences in public spaces. Specifically, this research asks: What are the opportunities/barriers to mobility for people with ADRD in accessing their neighbourhood and how does this affect their perception(s) and overall quality of life? I expect the outcomes of this research to be: gaining a better understanding of opportunities/barriers for those with ADRD in terms of land use strategies and urban design features, testing these findings through a pilot project and/or interactive simulator and providing recommendations for implementing these findings through planning policy. The study will combine diverse qualitative methods that are constructivist in nature (such as photovoice) with quantitative methods (such as GPS devices that can measure anxiety) in order to produce a rich understanding of lived experience and its relationship to diverse neighbourhood types and features in the built environment. The outcomes of this work will contribute to a growing body of knowledge exploring the linkages between equity, health and the organization of built form both theoretically and empirically. This research will have significant policy implications, given the paradigm shift in demographic change Canada is currently facing and the desire to ""age-in-place"". There is an impetus to research and develop enabling environments so people can continue their regular lives in their communities for as long as possible."

Moral Obligations in HIV Prevention Research Conducted in Resource-Poor Settings,"['Binik, Ariella']",['N/A'],"['Ethics In Hiv Prevention Research', 'International Research Ethics', 'Moral Obligations Of Researchers To Research Subjects']",105000.0,184529,"My proposed doctoral research will critically analyze an intense debate in international research ethics: whether researchers are morally obligated to provide treatment to those who become infected during HIV prevention trials conducted in resource-poor settings.  

The controversy over obligatory treatment is rooted in a broader debate over how to address global inequalities in access to health care. In the developed world, those who contract HIV during a study have recourse to antiretroviral therapy; however, developing world participants typically have no access to such treatment.  Commentators generally argue that because of this injustice in global access to health care, researchers and sponsors are morally obligated to provide treatment to those who become infected during prevention trials conducted in resource-poor settings.

The most common arguments seeking to justify obligatory treatment appeal to the moral principles of justice and beneficence, that is, acting in the interest of others.  Although arguments relying on these moral principles convincingly ground the claims that inequalities in access to health care between nations should be minimized, they fail to specify why international research is the legitimate vehicle through which to deliver additional care.  My project will explore the problematic aspects of these arguments and search for solutions. 

It is widely accepted that the best hope for inhabitants of resource-poor areas is the development of prevention vaccines or drug preventive therapy.  Consequently, clarifying the moral obligations of researchers to their subjects can help to ensure that inhabitants of these areas are treated equitably in research and that valuable research is not prevented or delayed."

Schools play a fundamental role in children's development, and school success predicts important health and educational outcomes. Older research has shown that excessive screen use in older children is related to poor academic results. However, with new forms of digital media rapidly evolving, screens used for educational reasons, and increased screen exposure in younger children, innovative research in this area is needed. By using comprehensive child screen use data collected at repeated timepoints starting in infancy and through grade 3 and 6 and measurements of school success in reading, writing, and math from standardized tests and report cards, we can better reflect on the changing screen-media and education landscapes. 

Using The Applied Research Group for Kids - TARGet Kids! cohort study, which includes children and their parents with repeated questionnaires starting in early childhood, this SUCCESS study will examine child screen use and Ontario provincial standardized testing data to better understand the relationship between different types of screen use and academic school success in elementary students. We will also study the roles that child mental health and sociodemographic factors play in these relationships and whether parent-reported data on child screen use is accurate. Results from SUCCESS will advance knowledge on how, when, and to what extent screen use affects children's academic school success.

Child nutrition behaviours developed early in life persist into adulthood and they could be modifiable targets for early nutrition interventions. Research is needed to understand the ongoing impact of children's nutrition on their development and education outcomes during the pandemic and identify effective interventions to ameliorate the impact. We propose to use the TARGet Kids! longitudinal cohort study, with data already collected pre-pandemic and since April 2020 to understand the impact of children's eating behaviours, dietary intake, and food environment on their motor, cognitive, language, emotional and behavioural development, school readiness and academic achievement in young children aged 0-12 years in the Greater Toronto Area. We also plan to understand the roles socio-demographic factors play in these relationships. This study will also test a nutrition-focused virtual intervention, which will equip parents with the skills and resources they need to promote healthful child eating behaviours and improve the nutrition, development, and education outcomes in children. With repeated data collected before the pandemic and during the first 1.5 years of the pandemic and detailed socio-demographic data collected from a diverse population, our study will understand and monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on young children's development and education and identify effective interventions to ameliorate the impacts of the pandemic and support the recovery of Canadian children and families."

Youth are at higher risk for potential health and safety consequences from cannabis, and there is an identified critical gap in cannabis education for school-aged youth. Given this gap, we are planning a cannabis education strategy for youth, called DECYDE (Directed Education on Cannabis for Youth Decision Empowerment). It will be evidence-based and use harm reduction principles with the aim to empower youth to make safe and informed choices.

We will co-create a youth and community-engaged curriculum and evaluation plan for in-school cannabis education for grades 7-12. The objectives of this planning grant are to:
i)Foster meaningful relationships with a diverse group of youth to enhance cannabis education for youth.
ii)Co-create with youth and stakeholders an education strategy that empowers youth cannabis decision-making (DECYDE).
iii)Co-create with youth and stakeholders a research protocol for the grades 7-12 DECYDE curriculum.

We will conduct the following activities through meaningful engagement with youth, young adults with lived experience, educators, and stakeholders.
a)Youth Engagement: Our youth advisory panel (YAP) will inform and co-create our planning workshop and development plan. 
b)Planning Workshop: A virtual planning workshop will share ideas about youth and educator needs for grades 7-12 cannabis curriculum. 
c)Development Workshop for Curriculum Plan: A virtual development workshop will be held to develop the curriculum plan. 
d)Research Evaluation Protocol: A final virtual workshop will be held to develop an evaluation plan. 

An informed curriculum plan and research protocol for cannabis education will directly benefit youth, as it will be designed for youth, by youth. As such, it will be more relatable and applicable, with the goal to empower youth to make safe and informed decisions and ultimately take control over and improve their health."

SDGs 4 and 6 also call special attention to the needs of persons with disabilities (PWDs). Reports indicate between 33% -  47% of schools in Africa do not have any form of WASH facility [1]. In many countries, achieving universal access to WASH services in schools will imply building and upgrading WASH facilities as well as ensuring that such facilities are disability friendly. Dr. Bisung recently conducted a scoping review to examine access to WASH services for PWDs in schools in Africa. Only 2 studies were found, and preliminary findings demonstrate that PWDs often experience WASH challenges including inaccessible latrines and boreholes, abuse, and discrimination [2,3].Subsequent interviews with policy makers in Ghana suggest that research to guide implementation of existing disability policies is key to addressing these challenges [4].This proposal aims to leverage findings from these previous research activities. Aligning with the objectives of this funding opportunity from CIHR, as well as the CCGHR Principles for Global Health Research, the purpose of this proposal is to: 
a) Bring together a multi-disciplinary team of researchers, health professionals, educators, disability organizations and policy makers to facilitate partnerships and identify common interests for funding opportunities;

The fundamental importance of water has been implicitly recognized under various international treaties, declarations and specific human rights instruments. Yet, about 844 million people in the world lack access to a basic drinking water source. While we often assume these sorts of problems `only' occur in developing countries, intra-regional variation in middle and high income countries reveals water-sanitation crises in our most vulnerable populations. Aligning with CIHR IPPH's research priorities on intersectoral action and health equity,  and building on my on-going work in developing countries, my research program is aimed at developing a viable  research agenda to reduce the negative outcomes associated with waterborne diseases in low-income areas of both Canada and Mexico.

In times of public health crisis-such as the COVID-19 pandemic-tapping into personal and institutional trust at multiple scales is paramount to disseminating critical information, maintaining confidence in disease containment measures, and eliciting behavioral changes among the citizenry. Mistrust, on the other hand, can have the opposite effect and lead to weak response to the pandemic. Many studies in different parts of the world have shown that without aspects of institutional, interpersonal, and political trust, politicians and public health professionals and scientist struggle to convince people to follow recommendations and instructions related to COVID-19. While the renewed interest in trust is refreshing for societies in a pandemic recovery world, the value of trust during a pandemic lies not in its associated outcomes, but in something much more fundamental-and that is how we conserve or strengthen social and political trust where it exists and how do we build trust where it is found to be low. This research will use a combination of quantitative and participatory methods to explore and identify strategies for sustaining or building trust in public health institutions in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), specifically Ghana, Guinea, and Liberia. Governments and public health institutions in SSA will be better positioned to effectively overcome the COVID-19 crisis and build inclusive and equitable recovery societies if they have the evidence necessary to repair, sustain, and build trust and political capital while strengthening the social contract between public health institutions and citizens."

A prospective study exploring the effects of daily movement reallocation on Canadian workers' risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality.,"['Biswas, Aviroop']","['Alter, David A', 'Landsman, Victoria', 'Prince Ware, Stephanie A', 'Shahidi, Faraz', 'Smith, Peter M']","['Cardiovascular Disease Risk', 'Epidemiology', 'Mortality', 'Prospective Cohort Study', 'Workers']",195076.0,488551,"Physical activity (PA) has been extensively shown to reduce chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and premature mortality, and is a key component of chronic disease prevention recommendations. The Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines are the first evidence-based recommendations to address the volume of PA and sedentary time throughout the entire day. The 24-H Canadian guidelines provide a broad recommendation that adults ""move more, reduce sedentary time, and sleep well' for optimal health. However, the recommendations do not distinguish between PA that occurs as part of the workday (e.g., occupational physical activity, OPA) or as part of leisure time (leisure time physical activity, LTPA). 

This project aims to compare how PA patterns may differ for those who are working and for the general population and compare if OPA - makes a difference to CVD health outcomes using a 24-H compositional time-reallocation approach that is increasingly gaining popularity in the PA literature. 

Five cycles of the Canadian Health Measures Survey will be examined (~10,000 participants, 2007 to 2017), linked to administrative health records up to 2019. Compositional  modelling and Cox proportional hazards models will be used to examine associations between 24-hour movement compositions and CVD events and all-cause deaths for workers and the general population. We will compare our findings to our previous work, where we identified the possibility of health risks from OPA, to identify whether the approaches have similar or discordant findings.

This research can inform the possibility of some PA conducted at work as being hazardous to health and detail 24-H movement strategies for workers to achieve optimal health. This work will inform a wider research program informing equitable public health and workplace policies that are actionable (considers implementation barriers) and readily implemented."

Active transportation (AT), involving walking or cycling are important modes of physical activity (PA) in adults, accounting for 33 to 68% of daily levels. The quality of built environments can support AT. Built environments refer to aspects of the physical environment that are either human-made or human-modified and include the places and spaces where we work, live, play and travel. Research examining the role of built environments on AT has largely focused on neighbourhood design and has highlighted the importance of walkability, accessibility of facilities and destinations, and AT infrastructure (e.g., bike and walk paths). In contrast, the role of the built environment around
workplaces is not as well understood. Built environments around the workplace offer the potential for increasing PA by supporting AT to/from work. This study, therefore, provides an opportunity to describe and characterize the built and social environments where Canadians work and live, and understand how these environments are associated with AT use, with a focus on differences by occupation and individual-level socioeconomic factors, age and between men and women. We will analyse existing population-based datasets: the 2016 Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC) and linked to the Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research Consortium (CANUE) to describe and characterize the built and social environments around the homes and workplaces of Canadian workers and their importance for AT to/from work.

Comprehensive analysis of health inequalities in global cities,"['Bixby, Honor R']",['N/A'],['Population Health'],140000.0,413887,"More people than ever live in cities, a statement that will be as true tomorrow as it is today. Since 1950, the global urban population has grown by over 450% and is currently estimated at 4.2 billion (over half  the global population). The physical, economic and social environments in cities have unique impacts on human health. The impacts of urban living on health are not the same for all countries, nor are they experienced equally by those living within cities, where better average health (compared to rural populations) often masks large within-city health inequalities. 

Cities across all regions bring together the richest and poorest in society with poor health often concentrated in the most deprived neighbourhoods and the lowest socio-economic groups accounting for a disproportionate burden of disease and mortality. My aim is to understand how cities across different settings can be leveraged to improve the health of impoverished residents and improve health equity. Using data from five case study cities, each with unique characteristics and histories and from different world regions: Accra (Ghana), Beijing (China), Dhaka (Bangladesh), London (UK) and Vancouver (Canada), I will address three important questions: 

1. What are the health characteristics of the poorest urban groups? 
2. What is the variability of health outcomes within the poorest urban neighbourhoods? 
3. Which diseases and injuries contribute the most to inequalities in life expectancy between the poorest and richest urban residents? 

This research will generate novel information crucial to design and implement policies and interventions that suitably target those falling behind in today's cities, and evaluate their impact on population health."

Sports can also serve as a health prevention initiative outside the traditional medical system, allowing access to individuals who might be reluctant to seek care and support, especially targeting underrepresented groups facing systemic health inequities. Although there are numerous benefits, a few negative challenges urgently need addressing, including injuries, concussions, and mental health challenges in sports.

Our research team will partner with diverse youth in the Niagara region to collaboratively generate a toolkit of strategies and approaches to prevent and intervene early in addressing injuries, concussions, and mental health challenges in youth sports, with the ultimate goal of using sports to address health equity. Using a co-design methodology, we will collaborate with youth researchers to understand barriers and facilitators, identifying potential solutions that can be implemented in sports. The aim is to generate innovative, feasible, youth-friendly, and equitable solutions. Youth will then test their solutions within the sport setting.

Our research team consists of experts in sports, mental health, epidemiology, psychology, and sociology, with input from youth who have firsthand experience with injury, concussions, and mental health in sport.

Validated injury surveillance is a crucial step for understanding what situations lead to injuries and how often they occur so that we can better target prevention strategies. However, there is currently no standardized system to determine injury rates and risk factors in the Canadian university varsity population (including >20,000 student-athletes).

The Canadian Integrated Injury and Health Surveillance System (Can-IIHSS) research program aims to inform the prevention, early-identification, and prediction of risks for all injuries amongst Canadian university athletes. We have partnered with U SPORTS, the university sport governing body, university clinics, and industry partners to use a surveillance system that can collect data on injury and concussion risk factors for university athletes by sex, gender and sport. We will use this system to improve our understanding of injury and concussion rates, mechanism and severity, changes in injury rates and risk factors over 3 years. This system will address a gap in the Canadian literature on injury. 

Canadian varsity athletes have high risks for injuries and concussion making them an important population for evaluating targeted injury prevention programs. The Can-IIHSS national network of clinicians and researchers working collaboratively to provide ongoing injury analyses can serve as a catalyst for future research questions enabling an easily accessible population to test new evidence-based innovations in injury prevention and inform solutions for Canadians at large."

Indeed, people who take these medications regularly tend to live longer and have fewer emergency visits to the hospital compared to those who don't.  However, only half of all people prescribed these medications take them regularly.  As a result, a great strain is place on hospitals because prescription medications are not being used correctly to keep people healthy.     

Non-adherence to medications costs billions of dollars per year in Canada because of all the extra hospital visits required in people who don't take their medications.  Non-adherence is often blamed on the cost of drugs, the side-effects of drugs, or poor communication between doctors and patients.  All of these factors are important; however, most of the studies carried out previously have not been able to find out how all of these problems add-up together to cause 1 out of every 2 people to become non-adherent.  Our study will identify the most important predictors of non-adherence so we can begin to find effective ways to fix the problem.    

The study will be carried out on people who start new prescription medications for diabetes, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol in Saskatchewan.  All people starting new medications will be identified and followed carefully over the next year using a survey and health records.  We will collect information about the patients, their doctors, and their drugs (including the cost).  By combining all this information in one study, we will be able to identify the most important problems that prevent people from taking their medications regulary.  Ultimately, we think this information will help keep more Canadians healthy and out of hospitals."

This research project will be conducted in collaboration with the peer-run community-based organization Chaitanya Mahila Sangha in the Bagalkot district of Karnataka that works with female sex workers and their community to understand more about the social factors leading to their high vulnerability to HIV. Most research to inform HIV prevention has focussed on influencing behaviour change in terms of increasing condom use with clients. However, HIV programs in Karnataka are recognizing that women are now using condoms a lot more with clients, but not so much with their intimate partners. This will undermine efforts to prevent the spread of HIV among this vulnerable population, and by extension the general population. Research has been done in Karnataka to show that women's vulnerability to the spread of HIV is related to many social factors leading to higher rates of violence and a reduced ability to use condoms in the intimate relationships of female sex workers. The goal of this research project is to better understand the ways that perpectives on gender norms and roles held by female sex workers and their non-paying intimate partners might be leading to decreased use of condoms or increased experience of violence in these relationships. The goal of this research is to inform Chaitanya's programs and others working with female sex workers to prevent HIV by creating a framework for improving self-esteem, trust, respect, and awareness of HIV risk among women in sex work, their intimate partners, and the wider society."

Thus, for the Syilx First Nation communities in British Columbia restoring and protecting their Indigenous food system is crucial to their health and way of life. Salmon is a central Syilx food; yet, the salmon population and salmon consumption decreased from high historical levels due to poor water management by settlers. Since 2004, the Syilx Nation has worked on a habitat restoration initiative, the Sockeye Reintroduction to Skaha Lake Project, to increase salmon numbers, which has resulted in a rise in fish harvesting. This initiative and its accompanying cultural activities has enabled about 5,000 Syilx to decide the direction of their lives (through self-determination) and has helped reconcile past social and environmental injustices through increasing food sovereignty (i.e., the right of peoples to define their own food systems which are ecologically, socially and culturally appropriate).

The objectives of this fellowship are to:
1. Assess changes in social determinants of health, food security and diet resulting from the initiative.
2. Document the barriers and enablers of the initiative.
3. Estimate how many salmon are being caught compared to historical levels, which groups of community members receive fish, and the cost-benefit of the initiative.
4. Provide insights into how to develop successful Indigenous food sovereignty initiatives.

This research will describe factors contributing to successful Indigenous food sovereignty initiatives and the importance of food sovereignty to Indigenous social determinants of health, food security and diet. This may result in adapted food sovereignty programming that ensures Indigenous peoples in Canada have access to their traditional foods."
To what extent does socioeconomic position explain racial inequities in health?,"['Blanchet, Rosanne']",['N/A'],"['Cardiovascular Morbidity', 'Cardiovascular Mortality', 'Health Equity', 'International Study', 'Race/Ethnicity', 'Socioeconomic Position']",55000.0,440253,"Racial inequities in health are a major public health problem in Canada and globally. For instance, Black adults living in Canada are significantly more likely to report hypertension, diabetes, and poor general and mental health than their White counterparts. Differences in socioeconomic position, such as differences in income and education level, may partly explain racial inequities in health, however we do not fully know to what degree they do so. My project will contribute to filling this gap with two studies. 

1) I will use a large database with information from ~70,000 adults living in Australia, Canada, the UK and the US. I will examine associations between race and health outcomes, and assess whether socioeconomic position explains these associations differently across countries.

2) I will combine data from eleven cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey to create a cohort of adults. I will link the cohort to administrative health data sets (Discharge Abstract Database and the Canadian Mortality Database) to identify fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular events. I will follow the cohort until the date of cardiovascular-related hospitalization, death, or 31 March 2018. I will examine associations between race and cardiovascular health outcomes, and the importance of socioeconomic position in explaining these associations.

I expect that race and socioeconomic position will interact to shape health differently across health outcomes and between countries. I anticipate that socioeconomic position will partly explain associations between race and all health outcomes.

This research will improve our knowledge about mechanisms causing racial inequities in health. This information can be used to inform program and policy strategies to close the health gap across racial groups in Canada and other high-income countries."

The negative economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may cause the diets and health of BIPOC peoples to fall further behind. This research will: 1) study how the diets and health of adults in Canada and in each of the provinces who identify as BIPOC changed from pre- to mid- to late-COVID, and whether not being able to afford enough healthy food can explain some of these trends; 2) interview BIPOC adults who could not afford enough healthy food during COVID in Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec to understand their experiences and the types of programs and policies that might help them to improve their diet and health; and 3) ask decision makers and BIPOC adults in Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec which programs and policies should be prioritized to improve the diets and health of BIPOC peoples going forward. This research will help us to understand how and why the diets and health of BIPOC peoples changed during COVID in Canada, and what it was like for BIPOC adults in Alberta, Ontario, and Quebec to go through these changes. It will also show which programs and policies decision makers and BIPOC adults think are the most important to protect the diets and health of BIPOC peoples in Canada going forward."

Arriving mainly from Mexico and Guatemala, TMW work in Canada for up to eight months or two years, and many come back year after year. Even though TMW produce and process food, many cannot afford enough healthy foods and have poor diets and health because of the difficult conditions in which they live and work here. Yet, we do not know to what extent this is the case, as no data on their access to food and eating patterns in Canada are available. Access to food and eating patterns are important determinants of health and are influenced by multiple factors (e.g. policies, laws, income). Two case studies will provide evidence for the question: How are TMW's food security, nutrition, and health shaped in Quebec's agri-food system? What can we do about it? The cases selected are the 1) agriculture and 2) food manufacturing sectors, in a Quebec context. First, we measure TMW's access to food, eating patterns and health and evaluate factors that influence them using an online survey with TMW. Second, we will explore TMW's food-related experiences in Canada with PhotoVoice interviews. Third, we will assess underlying factors that influence TMW's access to food, eating patterns and health by doing a document review and interviews with experts, such as decision makers, advocates, community organizations and employers. Fourth, TMW and experts will create and prioritize recommendations regarding TMW's food access, eating patterns and health. This research will help us understand how access to food, eating patterns and health are shaped among TMW in Quebec's agri-food system, including what their food-related experience in Canada means to them. It will also provide recommendations that TMW and experts think would improve TMW's access to food, eating patterns and health."

Traditionally, deprivation indices integrate various socioeconomic variables into one value. They support research in equity, diversity and inclusion. Canadian researchers have been creating first-generation deprivation indices from aggregated Census data for the past 20 years. Second-generation deprivation indices, first developed in the UK, add information about barriers to housing (overcrowding, affordability), services (distance in meters and minutes), living environment (cancer incidence, preventable death ratio), physical environment (air quality, flood risk, distance to industrial sites, road traffic collisions) and community safety (crime, theft, burglary, fires). These domains can be viewed as an environmental dimension. They require the inclusion of supplementary data sources from provincial or municipal institutions (eg. addresses). Developing such multidimensional deprivation indices for Canada requires the collaboration of representatives from all provinces in the sourcing, access, transformation and sharing of the data. Augmenting the datasets used in the making of these indices with routinely collected administrative data will result in a more up-to-date and relevant tool for health equity analysis in urban and rural areas. 
To scope interests for new Canadian deprivation indices, we have invited researchers from across the country with expertise in the application and creation of such tools, to take part in a meeting in Montreal in April 2020. Discussions around feasibility, data availability, and sustainability will be key components of the meeting. Presentation of Quebec's prototype of multidimensional deprivation indices will initiate discussions and planning. The meeting provides a platform to create a working group to collaborate in drafting a joint grant proposal in support of Canadian second-generation deprivation indices, to be submitted to the next CIHR project grants competition."
Decreasing the global burden of childhood malnutrition: integrating zinc supplementation into deworming programs,"['Blouin, Brittany J']",['N/A'],"['Childhood Malnutrition', 'Deworming', 'Global Health', 'Intestinal Parasite Infections', 'Low And Middle Income Countries', 'Neglected Tropical Diseases', 'Peru', 'Preschool-Age Children', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Zinc Supplementation']",105000.0,327859,"Childhood malnutrition is a serious problem in many developing countries. One of the causes of childhood malnutrition is intestinal worm infections. These worms live in the human gut and can prevent the absorption of nutrients and cause intestinal bleeding. Therefore, many people with these infections also suffer from loss of appetite, diarrhea, anemia, and impaired growth and development. Because of the serious health consequences associated with these worm infections, the World Health Organization recommends that children living in areas with a high infection rate be dewormed on a regular basis. Recently, researchers have found that micronutrient supplementation may provide additional benefit, over and above deworming, for infected individuals. In animals, research has suggested that if deworming is given with zinc supplements, the deworming will be more effective and re-infection less likely. Zinc supplements are also commonly given to treat diarrhea in children. We propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial in the Amazon region of Peru, where worm infections are known to be very common, especially in children. The goal of the study will be to determine if providing zinc supplements, in addition to deworming treatment: 1) increases the effectiveness of the deworming treatment; 2) reduces re-infection following deworming; and 3) improves child growth and morbidity. Two-year-old children will be recruited into the study and they will be followed for one year. The results of this study will be used to guide current recommendations for deworming and micronutrient programs in Peru and around the world.

The case of age-related dementia, and the situation of inmates secluded or confined to solitary spaces in penal institutions were observed to disturb caregivers in ways that create perplexity over procedures and best practices of care and that require reflection on the ethics of  policies and practices of different models of care in circulation. Our dissemination proposal intends to create a forum for an interdisciplinary discussion of care that joins forces with  social scientists and philosophers, and with medical personnel such as nurses and physicians, from hospitals and institutes in Ottawa and Kitchner-Waterloo, with neurologists and dementia researchers from the New York University Medical Center and the Pearl Barlow Center for the study of Memory. We are proposing a series of workshops, first in Toronto in November, 2012, second in  April 2013 in Ottawa, and a final conference in Toronto, September 2013, that will progressively create discussion around the question of the social and ethical foundations of  care and its manifestation in various methodological strategies in order to develop a framework for further research and for the dissemination of knowledge among caregivers, and related stakeholders. Expected outcomes of this dissemination proposal include, a redefinition of the situation of care and its relevant parameters that emerge through the year-long series of workshops, a proposed book that will collect the results of the year as contributions in a volume designed as one of a series published by Intellect Press, U.K. and University of Chicago, and the creation of an interdisciplinary network that will form the basis for both research and collaboration."

While MMH affects people of different racial and ethnic backgrounds, research consistently shows that Black mothers have a higher chance of experiencing MMH issues during pregnancy and after childbirth. Poor MMH interferes with fetal development leading to a higher rate of preterm birth and low birth weight. Postpartum MMH issues affect the emotional wellbeing of Black mothers and their ability to connect and respond to their infants needs. Untreated postpartum MMH issues increase the possibility for self and infant harm. The lack of support in the postpartum period and stress related to racism and socio-economic disadvantage experienced by Black mothers/birthing parents exacerbate MMH vulnerability, undermine their coping and resilience, and hinder their ability to seek help. Despite research showing Black mothers/birthing parent vulnerability to poor MMH, little is known about the risk and protective factors of MMH among Black mothers/birthing parents in Canada. This lack of research specifically on Black mothers/birthing parents in Canada makes it difficult to identify priority areas for intervention and policy action to optimize and improve maternal mental health outcomes for Black mothers/birthing parents and their children. The aim of this study is to understand the determinants of MMH among Black mother/birthing parents and to co-create a culturally safe best practices model to promote mental health equity using a mixed method approach. Identifying the determinants of MMH of Black mothers/birthing parents is critical to guiding the development of tailored and effective mental health interventions and programs to promote and support maternal mental health during and after pregnancy."
The impact of rurality on charitable food provisioning in British Columbia,"['Bocskei, Elietha M']",['N/A'],"['Charitable Food Assistance', 'Community -Level Response To Food Insecurity', 'Rurality', 'Vulnerable Populations']",17500.0,225382,"Charitable food programs such food banks, community meals and soup kitchens continue to provide food assistance to a growing number of food-insecure Canadians.  These programs are a community-level, often ad-hoc, response to local needs that have evolved over the past thirty years in different ways with little policy direction.  The current ""system"" is considerable in size yet limited in capacity and, as shown in limited research to date, likely not meeting the nutritional requirements of clients served.  While the national Hunger Counts estimate the number of clients served at many food banks across Canada, this count excludes many food banks and most charitable meal provision programs so that how the entire range of these programs delivering food and meals serve or (fail to serve) a growing client-base is not well understood.  To date, most research on charitable food provisioning in Canada has been conducted in large cities. However, compared to urban areas, communities in rural British Columbia have lower incomes, lower educational levels and higher rates of unemployment; and, they have reported shortages of food donations due to transportation limitations in rural areas.  This study examines food provisioning in a sample of rural communities on Vancouver Island in comparison to urban Greater Victoria, revealing any operational or service inequities for rural communities relevant to policy makers.  Results will add value to a current CIHR Pan-Canadian study examining the scope and characteristics of charitable food provisioning in four other major urban centres across Canada."
Learning Through Dialogue: Effects of Alcohol on Health and Wellbeing in Indigenous Communities,"['Bodnar, Tamara S']","['Cox, Lori V', 'Holman, Parker J', 'Raineki, Charlis']","['Alcohol', 'Community-Based Participatory Research', 'Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders', 'Health And Wellness', 'Indigenous Communities', 'Prenatal Alcohol Exposure', 'Science Education', 'Sex- And Gender-Differences']",75000.0,412564,"Alcohol is the most commonly used and abused drug among Canadians despite extensive research linking alcohol with negative health outcomes. While Indigenous populations report higher rates of alcohol abstinence, Indigenous people also report higher levels of heavy drinking and among Canadian Indigenous communities, 75% identified alcohol as a community problem. Overall rates of alcohol consumption have generally remained stable; however, alcohol consumption among women is rapidly increasing. In the context of high rates of unplanned pregnancies, and the reality that pregnancy recognition often does not occur until well into the first trimester, increased alcohol consumption among women presents a significant health challenge to Canadians. Indeed, it is estimated that approximately 1% of children born in Canada are affected by Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), and recent population-prevalence studies suggest that this is likely a significant underestimate. One critical barrier to addressing addiction and prenatal alcohol exposure, particularly in the context of Indigenous communities, involves pervasive stereotypes and stigma about alcohol use and FASD. Importantly, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada: Calls to Action specifically recognized addiction and FASD as priority areas, with emphasis on preventative programs developed in collaboration with Indigenous people. To this end, the present proposal aims to engage Indigenous communities in knowledge exchange with the goal of co-creating culturally appropriate educational, hands-on activities to learn about the effects of alcohol on health and wellbeing across gender. Specifically, this proposal includes involvement by key stakeholders such as Elders, school partners, and youth, and will incorporate both science principles and Indigenous knowledge and ways of knowing, with the overarching goal of empowering youth as self-advocates and catalysts of health and wellbeing within their communities."
Promotion of cognitive health in older people from the perspective of the theory of salutogenesis: a review of literature,"['Bodryzlova, Yuliya']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Assess Reinforcement', 'Cognitive Aging', 'Cognitive Health', 'Positive Health', 'Salutogenesis', 'Social Determinants Of Aging', 'Social Determinants Of Cognitive Aging', 'Successful Aging']",1000.0,400367,"To promote healthy cognitive aging, public health could shift efforts from a model that emphasizes frailty and ""gaps"" to one that reinforces ""assets"". The theory of salutogenesis (SalT) is a promising framework for the reinforcement of assets; however, it has not become a working instrument for policymakers or public health professionals. Possible reasons include the fact that (a) the principal concept of the SalT, sense of coherence (SOC, the perception of the world as meaningful, manageable and comprehensive), was not shown to predict  health status in empirical studies; (b) resources about SOC (wealth/status, ego identity, spirituality, protective health orientation, coping, social support, skills/knowledge and commitment) have not been systematically studied in the SalT frameworks.
In this work, we assessed the usefulness of the SalT to explain cognitive health in elderly populations. We conducted a Pubmed search. Further, we examined pertinent results of empirical studies with key concepts of the SalT (SOC and resources about SOC), namely: the concept of the SalT as an independent variable, and cognitive health outcomes (cognitive functions, and incidence and prevalence of dementia) as a dependent variable. 
We found consistent positive associations between all the key concepts of the SalT and cognitive health outcomes in the elderly. Also, we found that (1) some of these associations were more studied than others; (2) some of the key concepts are indistinguishable (e.g.: coping and skills/knowledge) in real-life empirical studies and (3) that the recent development of the theory in public health would permit the rearrangement of the SalT to make the theory more suitable for the practical implementation..
Further discussion between researchers, health professionals and community members is needed to create a workable SalT.2.0 framework to promote cognitive health among older adults."
A biopsychosocial perspective on sex differences and sex-specific effects in pediatric pain,"['Boerner, Katelynn E']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2500.0,324408,"Sex differences are a common finding in pain research involving adults, with women consistently reporting higher levels of pain and more chronic pain conditions than men. However, there has still been very little attention to this issue in children and adolescents. The present symposium will examine sex differences in pediatric pain, considering the biological, psychological, and social factors involved. Ms. Boerner's talk will focus specifically on social factors, looking at how children learn how to react to pain by observing their parent's behaviour during painful events. 

This talk will present the results of a research study where parents (50% mothers, 50% fathers) and 6-8 year-old children (50% girls, 50% boys) were asked to complete the cold pressor task (CPT), which is a safe and commonly used method of inducing mild to moderate levels of pain in the lab. Children first watched their parent complete the CPT and, unbeknownst to their child, parents had been randomly assigned to either show a natural, exaggerated, or minimized pain expression during the CPT. Then the child completed the CPT themselves. The pain experience of the parent and child was measured with self-reports of pain intensity, measured pain tolerance, as well as coding of their facial expressions. This talk will present the results of analyses examining whether the child's pain behaviour and reports of pain were influenced by their parent's pain behaviours, and whether this differed based on the sex of the parent and child (i.e., are boys more influenced by watching their father than their mother, and vice versa for girls?). 

This research will help increase our understanding of the role of fathers in child pain, as most previous research in this area has only studied mothers. The results of this study will also contribute to explanations of how pain behaviours can be learned through parental modeling, which will have clinical implications for family-based interventions."

Racism and loss of cultural identity have led to significant mental health challenges, including some of the highest adolescent suicide rates in the world. Inuit communities are expressing an urgent need for innovative approaches to address this crisis. Our youth- and community-directed initiative is designed to establish a new path toward Inuit youth wellness and the collective prevention of self- and community harms. Our design uses a Two-Eyed Seeing model, which combines local Inuit cultural knowledges alongside evidence-based mental health strategies. The project activities will be led by the youth themselves, supported by their Elders and other community mentors. Youth will design science-based mental wellness tools using state-of-the-art technologies such as e-games and immersive virtual reality. The resulting virtual interactions and spaces will simulate Qaggiqs or ""meeting places"", large igloos that facilitate community renewal and celebration. Thus, together with the communities, we will develop and assess a wellness program that acknowledges the colonial roots of youth's existing struggles while promoting novel asset-building and resilience strategies. This project focuses on cultural identity, and develops strategies for reducing anxiety, boredom, depression, and hopelessness (considerations in the development of suicidality in Inuit Youth). Youth will: 1) identify factors that they believe most contribute to current rates of mental health challenges, 2) select from a range of known protective strategies to address those challenges, 3) incorporate the selected strategies in new e-tools that they design, and 4) rigorously evaluate the new tools. The integration of these new tools within virtual Qaggiqs may open doors to novel mental health-enhancing approaches needed to support resilience and remedy the unacceptable rates of suicidality in remote Nunavut communities."

We are further hoping to invite youth to identify the culturally specific personal and community resources they relied on to get through the many restrictions that were imposed in the pandemic. This information, as well as the youth's reports on COVID-19 related challenges and needs, would provide input on useful tools and services that could be offered to communities in post-pandemic efforts to best support resilience. The proposed study builds on recommendations provided by youth who participated in a recent small pilot study which identified multiple facets of youth and community resilience. In that preliminary study, youth highlighted the notion of connection as being an important concept leading to resilience when physically isolated. This study would 1) Add to our limited understanding of the psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic 2) Design, together with youth leaders, a way to identify a comprehensive list of cultural and community aspects of connection believed to contribute to resilience: several culturally sanctioned research approaches will be considered in consultation with the youth. 3) Investigate additional and alternative ways of creating connection in a technological age. 4) Identify, together with youth, existing as well as wished-for social structures and systems that may further support connection and resilience during a pandemic. 5) Situate resulting findings in a culturally-embedded philosophical framework-Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (IQ)-to allow for a richer and more accurate understanding of resilience."
Emotional Intelligence in Adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders,"['Boily, Roxanne M']",['N/A'],"['Adolescents', 'Autism Spectrum Disorders', 'Emotional Intelligence', 'Social Experiences']",8750.0,285449,"People with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) struggle with social situations. When they fail to fit in, they may feel poorly about themselves and this influences their overall personal health. Emotional intelligence (EI) is related to our social experiences and as a result, it could be used to explain why individuals with ASD struggle in social situations. EI includes whether we can label emotions, understand them, and control them. There are two types of EI: ability and trait. Ability EI is related to how we reason about emotions while trait EI is related to personal characteristics that foster appropriate social interactions. Despite its promising implications for improving social skills, research about EI in youth with ASD is limited (aside from work from our research group). Moreover, existing social skills programs for individuals with ASD fail to produce consistent or lasting improvements in social skill performance. To understand how ability and trait EI relate to the social experiences of teens with ASD, I will collect information from teens with and without ASD, their parents, and their teachers to understand how typically developing adolescents compare to adolescents with ASDs in their characteristics and skills for emotional interactions. More precisely, I will evaluate how they perceive, use, understand, and manage emotions and how that relates to their self-reported social stress and interpersonal skills. Parents and teachers will also be asked to provide information in order to obtain a different perspective of the adolescents' social skills and adaptability. Pinpointing the differences in EI between people with and without ASD will clarify the relationship between social and emotional skills, and generate novel, yet critical information relevant to intervening with ASDs. In addition, understanding this relationship will inform programming to improve the academic and social outcomes of persons with ASD as well as their personal health."

Images of Movement and Land-based Identity: Defining Wellness from an Indigenous Perspective,"['Boivin, Lisa']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2800.0,364687,"This oral presentation will use the Indigenous tradition of image-based storytelling. Paintings will be presented to share Indigenous experience, perspectives and identity as it relates to land through image-based stories. Image-based storytelling is a teaching tool that introduces clinicians to Indigenous perspectives of wellness related to movement on the land. Sharing images engages clinicians in dialogue about the connection of Indigenous and Western worldviews related to movement and movement rehabilitation. 

This paper accompanying this oral presentation aims to share knowledge of the nature and meaning of movement from an Indigenous perspective of land-based wellness and to illustrate the disabling effects of colonialism. Through the process of colonialism Canada, as among many countries around the world has deliberately separated Indigenous peoples from their identity, and removed them from their traditional lands and territories. Indigenous peoples' health and wellness is directly determined by their ability to have access to and mobility on traditional lands and territories. Therefore, land-based wellness impeded by colonialism. Movement rehabilitation takes place from a western (colonial) perspective and clinicians engage with Indigenous patients without an understanding of the disabling effects of colonialism. Consequently, this creates a clinical barrier between clinician and Indigenous patient. Clinical practitioners require knowledge of colonialism to develop and strengthen clinical relationships with Indigenous patients."

My objective in this thesis is to explore the disabling effects of colonialism by reflecting on and contrasting: (1) my journey as an Indigenous person who has been diagnosed with a disability (i.e., a learning disability) and (2) the journey of my father as an Indigenous person who was diagnosed with a disability (i.e. a mobility impairment caused by polio). I will use arts-based Indigenous research methods to compare our journeys in terms of our educational/academic and healthcare/clinical experiences as 'disabled' individuals. I will also explore the role of healing and 'rehabilitation' in addressing our disabilities and the disabling effects of the academic and healthcare structures. Both were extremely harmful; there was no healing to take place in the academy or through clinical methods of rehabilitation. We rejected colonial constructed identities. Rather, I will explore how rehabilitation took place through reclamation of culture."
Mind the gap: Duration of protection from measles maternal antibody in Canadian infants - generating evidence to update policy,"['Bolotin, Shelly', 'Science, Michelle E', 'Severini, Alberto']","['Crowcroft, Natasha S', 'Deeks, Shelley L', 'Gemmill, Ian M', 'Halperin, Scott A', 'McLachlan, Elizabeth']","['Immunity', 'Infant', 'Maternal', 'Measles', 'Population Immunity', 'Public Health', 'Serology']",225676.0,355984,"Measles is the most infectious vaccine-preventable disease. Although measles no longer infects us routinely in Canada, recent outbreaks have raised concerns that some population groups may not be adequately protected against the disease. Of particular concern are infants, who are born with antibodies transferred from their mother during pregnancy. We previously assumed that infants are protected by their mothers' antibodies until they are capable of making their own through vaccination at 12 months. However, recent evidence suggests that in settings like Canada, where most mothers are immune to measles through vaccination, levels of maternal antibody are lower since vaccination results in less robust immunity than natural infection. This results in a shorter duration of protection in infants, potentially leaving them susceptible to measles. 

This study aims to determine the duration of time that infants are protected from measles in their first year of life, between the time their maternal antibodies are no longer protective until they receive their first dose of measles vaccine at 12 months. This study will help to answer critical practical public health questions related to measles prevention and control. Specifically, updated Canadian data are required to evaluate whether current recommendations for immunization of infants at 12 months need to be reassessed. These data will also aid with the management of infants who are exposed to measles, including the age at which vaccine and other preventative medical treatments can be administered, and determining susceptibility for isolation purposes."

Although a vaccine has been available for over 50 years, measles is not controlled in many countries, and there is a resurgence of outbreaks worldwide. Despite no longer circulating in Canada, measles continues to be imported from abroad, increasing our risk of outbreaks. In addition, an insufficient vaccination rate in some communities, and the possibility that protection from measles vaccine will decrease over time, may limit our ability to control measles. Our risk of outbreaks depends on the number of people in our population who are protected from measles, who can then protect others around them who are not immune.
Our study aims to evaluate whether enough Ontarians are immune to measles to avoid large outbreaks, and to predict when declining immunity may become a risk to measles control. Our results will also assess whether vaccine immunity varies based on age, sex, vaccine program eligibility, and where an individual is born. This study will provide important evidence needed to inform policy advisers and decision-makers to improve practices related to measles immunization programs to ensure measles remains eliminated in Canada. It will also provide important evidence to help other countries optimize measles control strategies."

However, a deeper understanding of the effects of bereavement remains unknown. The current study will examine the effects of sudden death on bereaved relatives in the Manitoba population. Parents who have lost a child to suicide or other sudden accidental cause of death will be invited to complete a telephone survey. The survey will explore their experiences of emotional problems, depression, grief, and support from others. The survey will also ask bereaved parents what treatment they feel they need, and whether they have seen a doctor or other professional. Their responses will be compared to people in the general population to see how the emotional difficulties, treatment needs, and health service use of bereaved parents compares to others. This will provide much needed answers about the health and treatment needs of bereaved people, a group that in the past has not received appropriate treatment services. The findings from this study will therefore help to develop effective treatments for bereaved family members, and thus improve the lives of people who have suffered the sudden death of a loved one."

Health perceptions of obese individuals and the impact of public health messaging,"['Bombak, Andrea E']",['N/A'],"['Chronic Disease', 'Critical Medical Anthropology', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ethnography', 'Health Perceptions', 'Messaging', 'Obesity', 'Public Health']",70000.0,257398,"The prevalence of obesity in Canada has increased over the last 25 years. Nearly one quarter of Canadians (24.1%) are obese. As obesity is associated with health conditions including diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, and certain cancers, it has negative effects on individuals' health and health care costs. However, less discussed than the negative effects on health and resulting burden on the health care system, is the widespread discrimination faced by obese people in their relationships, workplaces, and the healthcare system. The majority of public health messaging encourages weight loss and focuses on the negative effects of excess weight. Unfortunately, weight loss can be difficult to achieve and maintain, due to environmental, social, biological, and genetic factors. However, there is evidence that improvements in health outcomes are possible with increased physical activity and healthier eating habits, without accompanying weight loss. Some studies have even shown that being slightly overweight may be beneficial in reducing risk of mortality. Despite this research, public health messaging continues to focus on excess weight as being necessarily unhealthy. While obesity is a serious health concern, messages that focus exclusively on obesity as problematic may contribute to weight discrimination and be disempowering to obese individuals, rather than motivational. For my study, I will investigate how people who identify as overweight, obese, or as eating disorder sufferers describe their health, what they prioritize in regard to their health and wellbeing, and how this affects and is affected by their experiences, particularly in regard to their interactions with medical professionals and in encountering messaging from public health and mass media. This research has the potential to develop public health messaging that will incorporate what Canadians view as essential to their health and well-being and inspire pro-active and empowering health behaviours."

HCS care across Canada is fragmented due to variation in access to genetic testing and high risk follow up. These systemic variations result in indirect social and economic impacts on HCS patients and families. Yet, the indirect burden of HCS is often unaccounted for and underestimated. There is a need to map these indirect socio-economic impacts of the variations in systems of care for patients with suspected and confirmed inherited cancer syndromes across Canada. First, we will explore indirect social and economic impacts of current systems of HCS care using multigene panel testing. We will conduct interviews and a cross-sectional survey among patients with HCS from Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), British Columbia (BC) and Ontario (ON). We will examine outcomes related to care (e.g., wait times, access), psychosocial impacts (e.g., discrimination, distress), and economic impacts (e.g., out-of-pocket and travel costs) associated with HCS. Next, we will assess direct and indirect socioeconomic impacts of genomic sequencing (future state of HCS care) and incidental findings (IFs, results unrelated to HCS) for HCS patients. We will conduct interviews, evaluate patient-reported outcomes and an economic evaluation, building on a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT) among patients with suspected HCS. We will assess outcomes related to care (e.g., follow-up management), psychosocial impacts (e.g., career, reproductive decisions) and economic impacts associated with genomic sequencing and IFs  (e.g., to the health care system and patients). This study will examine the direct and indirect socioeconomic and psychological impacts of HCS on patients and families. Comparing among NL, BC and ON will allow us to identify provincial differences in the indirect socioeconomic burden of HCS, to inform policy, health care and social system interventions to mitigate inequities."

Zoomers on the Go: Implementation of a Peer-Led Exercise Program for Falls-Prevention Across Canada,"['Bouchard, Danielle', 'Louis, Richard', 'Kehler, Dustin S', 'Sénéchal, Martin', 'Sibley, Kathryn M']","['Byrne, Jeannette M', 'Cleland, Claire L', 'Copeland, Jennifer L', 'Dionne, Isabelle', 'Dogra, Shilpa', 'Herman, Catherine M', 'Rhodes, Ryan E', 'Saunders, Travis J']",['Aging'],25000.0,459772,"Many Canadian adults fall every year. The consequences can be catastrophic for older adults, including being hospitalized for long periods and moving to a long-term care facility. In some cases, falls can even result in death. Of all strategies, regular exercise is the best approach to prevent falls in older adults. Even if many exercise programs are offered to older adults, long-term plans and funding towards programs that truly reduce the risk of falls are rare in many Canadian communities. Consequently, there is a need to implement exercise programs that do not solely rely on short-term funding but benefit from partnerships with existing community resources. When such community partnerships are formed, it ensures that programs can continue.

In New Brunswick, Zoomers on the Go, a community exercise program that specifically targets a reduction in the risk of falls for people age 50+ years, has shown promising results. Through this 12-week program, we have demonstrated that participants improve their physical abilities (e.g., strength, speed, balance), making them more functional and reducing their risk of falls. Importantly, this program is delivered at no cost to the participant, is provided by a volunteer peer, and is supported by local resources. Due to the success of this program and the resources required, it could be implemented across Canada. 

The Healthy Cites Implementation Studies Team Grant will be used to: 1) Extend the offering of Zoomers on the Go to Canadian municipalities from all provinces, and 2) Understand the elements that make this program a success. All Canadian adults can benefit from regular exercises, such as a reduction in the risk of falling. Although it is clear that regular exercise leads to a reduction in falls, there is a lack of long-term programs available across the country that were proven to truly reduce the risk of falls."

Exposure to Organophosphate and Pyrethroid Pesticides and Neurobehavioral Problems in Children: The Canadian Health Measures Survey,"['Bouchard, Maryse']",['N/A'],"['Children', 'Environmental Health', 'Neurobehavior', 'Neurotoxicity', 'Organophosphates', 'Pesticides', 'Pyrethroids']",,231444,"Pesticides are widely used, mainly to combat pest infestation in agriculture and homes. Pesticide residues are commonly detected on certain foods, particularly fruits and vegetables. Toxic effects are well-documented for highly exposed groups of the population, particularly on the nervous system. Children vulnerable to the neurotoxic effects of pesticides because of their developing brain, greater dose of exposure, and incompletely developed capacity to detoxify pesticides present in the body. Studies suggest that pesticides can have adverse effects on children's brain development. For instance, studies conducted in groups with high levels of exposure, such as agricultural communities, reported cognitive deficits and behavioral problems. Yet, few studies have examined risks of pesticide exposure for children from the general population, as opposed to highly exposed groups. 
The present study will examine whether exposure to pesticides is associated with behavioral problems in Canadian children. We will use the data collected in 2007-09 among 1717 children aged 6 to 17 years participating into the Canadian Health Measures Survey. For each child participating into the survey, the parent answered a questionnaire about their child's behavioral problems. In addition, the concentration of pesticide residues was measured in a sample of children's urine. This measure is an indicator of the level of exposure experienced by the child, and will be used to examine whether children more exposed present more behavioral problems. We will also consider the potential role of other factor known to be associated with behavioral problems in children, such as age, sex, and socioeconomic status. This survey is representative of the general population living in Canada, and therefore the findings are generalizable. The results will be applicable to guide further investigation on pesticide neurotoxicity, as well to carry out risk assessment for regulating pesticides."
Reversibility of Neurobehavioral Deficits Associated with Manganese Exposure from Drinking Water,"['Bouchard, Maryse']",['N/A'],"['Children', 'Cognition', 'Cohort', 'Drinking Water Contamination', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Manganese Neurotoxicity', 'Memory', 'Neuromotor Function']",300000.0,213816,"Manganese is an essential nutrient in small dose, but in excess, this metal can be neurotoxic for humans. In several regions of Canada, drinking water can contain a high concentration of manganese. Yet, the risks for children's health are largely unknown. Our research team carried out a study on 362 children showing that higher manganese concentration in home tap water was associated with significant deficits on tests of intelligence and memory. For instance, there was a drop of six intellectual quotient points in children exposed to the higher levels of manganese in water compared to those exposed to the lower levels. For approximately half of the children in the study, exposure to manganese from drinking water has dramatically diminished since the initial study because the water is now treated to remove manganese. A key-question is whether the cognitive deficits are permanent or reversible. This cohort of children represents a unique opportunity to answer important questions on the effects of manganese on children's health.

We propose to follow-up these children to examine whether children who benefited from a reduction of water manganese concentration improved their cognitive performance, compared with children whose exposure did not change. In order to do this, we will assess children's cognitive function with the same tests used in the initial study, and we will re-measure manganese concentration in their home tap water. The analysis will also take into account a series of variables determinant for children's cognitive abilities, such as the socioeconomic status. Our hypothesis is that reducing children's exposure to manganese might reverse cognitive impairment, or at least prevent further deterioration in children who were exposed to high levels in the past. 

The prevention of cognitive deficits is of upmost important, as cognitive abilities are predictive of many outcomes later in life, including health and future earning capacity."

The reasons for the rapid increase in the rates of obesity are not well elucidated and it is thought that genetics and nutritional changes do not fully explain this trend but rather it is a complex interplay among individual behaviors, the built environment, and possibly exposures to certain synthetic chemicals that may disrupt energy balance. In particular, exposure to environmental chemicals during the fetal development has been hypothesized to contribute to the rising rates of childhood obesity. We will investigate whether exposure to certain environmental chemicals during the perinatal period is associated with weight gain in children. To achieve this, we will use data already collected and available for analysis, pertaining to children from different provinces in Canada. These children have been followed up from birth until approximately 5 years of age to assess their weight."

Empirical Analysis of the Effectiveness of Patent Rights as an Incentive for Pharmaceutical Innovation,"['Bouchard, Ron A']",['N/A'],"['Drug Approval', 'Drug Patenting And Litigation', 'Government Regulation', 'Innovation', 'Pharmaceutical/Biotechnology', 'Technology Commercialization']",300000.0,192015,"Global drug development and regulation are undergoing a substantial transition. This has been accompanied by growing debate over the validity of the claim that a properly functioning public health system requires acceptance of emerging lifecycle models of drug regulation that promote early access to therapeutic products and privilege strong intellectual property and regulatory (IPR) rights. IPR rights are presumed to be necessary for all stages of product development, including publicly-funded medical research, university technology transfer and private research and development activities. Without these rights, advocates claim pioneering drug development would not occur and the public would be without breakthrough drugs. The goal of the proposed research is to investigate this claim empirically. The project is split into three components. The first is an assessment of new and follow-on drugs approved during the time regulatory incentives intended to stimulate innovation came into force. The second is a study of patents and patent litigation associated with these approvals, and thus the subsequent shaping of the market for brand-name and generic products. The third is the development of an analytical model of regulated pharmaceutical innovation, focusing on the effectiveness of regulatory incentives intended to encourage innovation. Of particular interest will be the synchronization of drug approval, patenting and litigation data to specific legislative and policy initiatives intended to stimulate access to novel therapeutic products, including linkage regulations tying drug approval to drug patenting and the lifecycle regulation regime for drug approval. Combined, these regulatory initiatives provide bookends for a novel and unique ""natural experiment"" to evaluate the strength of the claim that strong IPR rights are necessary for breakthrough pharmaceutical innovation."

La relation entre la chaleur extrême et la santé est typiquement étudiée à l'aide de modèles statistiques comme la régression. Peu d'études se sont intéressées à l'utilisation de l'intelligence artificielle (IA) pour analyser les impacts de la chaleur extrême sur la santé. Avec l'augmentation prévue des épisodes de chaleur accablante dans le futur, il devient primordial de s'intéresser à cette problématique avec des approches novatrices comme l'IA. Dans ce projet, plusieurs techniques d'IA seront utilisées pour modéliser la mortalité (décès) et la morbidité (admissions à l'urgence, hospitalisations et transports ambulanciers) liées à la chaleur extrême pour différentes causes de maladies. Ces différentes approches seront comparées entre elles ainsi qu'avec des modèles plus traditionnels. Une variété d'indicateurs météorologiques et atmosphériques seront utilisés pour bien représenter le phénomène de chaleur extrême au sein des modèles d'IA. L'utilisation de l'IA pour la relation chaleur extrême-santé a le potentiel de mener à une meilleure compréhension de ce phénomène et d'améliorer l'estimation des impacts à des fins de prévention et de surveillance. Ces nouveaux modèles serviront à estimer les impacts économiques de la chaleur extrême et à projeter ces impacts dans le futur en fonction de divers changements à venir (climatiques, démographiques et socioéconomiques) dans les parties subséquentes du projet de doctorat. Ces résultats aideront les autorités de santé à mieux se préparer afin de limiter les impacts négatifs de la chaleur extrême."

NF1 is one of the most widespread autosomal dominant diseases in the world. Its physical manifestations can severely deform the body and induce cognitive problems. Those who are affected not only have to deal with the social stigma associated with the disease, but also with predisposition to anxiety and depression. Adolescence is a particularly sensitive period when one is affected with NF1. Hormonal changes and periods of rapid growth could exacerbate physical deformities at an age when appearance, peer acceptance and social integration are of paramount importance. We must also consider that late adolescents are only beginning their learning of love and sexuality at this point of their lives, consequently, the fear of change in appearance, the risk of a pregnancy aggravating their illness, or the risk of giving birth to an affected child will complicate the situation even more. In this context, our specific objectives, by way of a pan-Canadian qualitative research project using an online text-based interview, are: 1) To determine what late adolescents know, would like to know or need to know in relation to the medical aspects of NF1; 2) To identify the concerns of late adolescents regarding the impact of NF1 on their social life and private life, and their sources of anxiety; 3) To assess the pertinence of intergenerational dialogue. The outcomes will be used to create a toolkit allowing for a better understanding of late adolescents' needs, such as: a) medical, genetic and reproductive information, b) clinical interventions and care-giving, c) academic and psychological support, d) inter-generational dialogue."

COPD is the number one cause of hospital admissions among chronic illnesses in Canada and the fourth leading cause of death globally. COPD is also an extremely costly disease: yearly costs of COPD in Canada are expected to increase from $4 billion in 2010 to $9.5 billion by 2030. While tobacco smoke is recognized as the single most important risk factor for the development and progression of COPD, 25% to 45% of individuals with COPD have never smoked. To decrease the burden of disease, we must therefore better understand the contribution of environmental factors beyond cigarette smoking to COPD development and exacerbation. 

While past studies have shown associations between COPD and air pollution and weather, the consequences of climate change on COPD and respiratory health are not well understood. Climate projections show that Canadian cities can expect an increase in abnormal weather events such as heat waves and extreme cold events, more wildfires leading to poor air quality episodes, and overall higher levels of air pollution over the next decades. This project will make use of data collected by three large pan-Canadian studies linked to short and long-term air pollution and climate data as well administrative health information on COPD hospital admissions and medication use to explore how environmental factors stemming from climate change will impact the burden of COPD in Canada. Results from this project will help develop public health and clinical management guidelines for COPD and respiratory heath, thereby allowing clinicians and policy makers to adapt to a changing climate. This study will also help communicate the respiratory health risks of climate change to the public and decision makers."

To adequately guide clinical and public health responses to current and future outbreaks, the World Health Organization has established identifying groups of individuals at high risk of severe infection as an urgent research priority. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a prevalent underlying co-morbidity and a leading risk factor for complications of COVID-19, but little is known on specific pulmonary risk factors for COVID-19 severity. We propose to mobilize an existing resource, the CanCOLD longitudinal cohort, to address this knowledge gap.

CanCOLD is a population-based cohort of 1561 individuals aged > 40 years categorized as healthy, ""at-risk"" (ex- & current smokers) and COPD recruited in 9 of Canada's largest cities, where COVID-19 transmission is the greatest. We will leverage this established cohort to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 and its presentation (asymptomatic and symptomatic) in COPD, at-risk and healthy controls via serological antibody test. We will also exploit pre- and post-outbreak data and biosamples collected by CanCOLD to characterize prevalence and hazard of COVID-19 hospitalization (with/without ICU) and death according to four pre-morbid pulmonary risk factors: pre-existing pulmonary disease (COPD, asthma, chronic bronchitis), severity of airflow obstruction, lung structure abnormalities, and use of respiratory medication. We will identify and characterize the immunologic profile of CanCOLD participants and its relationship with COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Finally, we will investigate the impacts of social isolation and confinement on mental health amongst Canadians with chronic airway disease. Ultimately, this study will provide an integrated perspective on COVID-19 susceptibility that can guide recommendations for clinical practice and public health strategies."
Free Standing Birth Centres: Planning an Ethnography of an Alternative Workplace for Midwives,"['Bourgeault, Ivy L']","['Benoit, Cecilia M', 'James, Yvonne', 'Shoemaker, Esther S']","['Ethnography', 'Free Standing Birth Centres', ""Midwives' Work Setting""]",8907.0,308179,"During the past century, childbirth in most of the industrialized world moved into an institutional hospital setting. In Ontario, midwives offer women the choice of home or hospital birth. However, despite this option, the vast majority of babies in the province continue to be born in hospital. At the same time, the Canadian Association of Midwives notes that it remains challenging for midwives in Ontario to access privileges at hospitals and that they face barriers in being able to practice within the full scope of their profession. Recently, a provincial pilot project aided in the development of three free-standing birth centres (FSBCs) to provide low risk pregnant women and their families with a greater range of birthing options. In February 2014, the Ottawa Birth and Wellness Centre (OBWC) opened its doors to its first birthing woman and her family. Birth centres represent a new and unique workplace for Ontario midwives and introduce unchartered opportunities for interprofessional collaboration in a midwife led environment alongside emerging health care support roles, such as birth centre aides. 
In partnership with the OBWC, academic researchers Bourgeault and Benoit plan to map an ethnographic study that addresses the following research questions:
•How does the social care context of the birth centre impact midwives' work lives and their professional identity? And
•How does the OBWC facilitate or hinder interprofessional collaboration (among midwives, midwives and obstetricians/physicians, midwives and birth centre aides)?"

In source countries, for example, migration may create shortages of health workers, placing limits on people's access to health care.  Migration can also put migrating health workers at disadvantage. The majority of health workers who migrate internationally (mostly as nurses) are women, but women's experiences may be different to those of migrating men. For example, when men and women migrate they are often forced into lower skilled work, but women may face additional disadvantage as a result of gender inequality, race and ethnicity, and being a non-national in their new countries. Evidence regarding the implications of sex/gender for migration, and its impacts on population health and health systems, however, is difficult to piece together.  Indeed, sex/gender is rarely a focus of migration research, data and literature.  Sex/gender analysis outlines a process that can be used to systematically analyze research data taking men and women into account.  Sex/gender analysis can be used to expose the differential impacts and effects of the international migration of health workers on men and women, some of which are harmful, unfair and inequitable. Our proposal is to develop a tool that helps to analyze the literature and data of health worker migration in order to understand how sex and gender impact the international migration of health workers and its effects on population health and health systems, and for assisting research planning.  To accomplish this we will convene a meeting of researchers in sex/gender analysis and migration theory and other students of health worker migration. At this meeting, we will draft a tool and use it to assist our research planning in health worker migration specifically for understanding the role of sex/gender with the long-term goal of developing evidence-based responsive and responsible policies."

Des études réalisées auprès d'adultes ayant un trouble psychotique indiquent que près du tiers d'entre eux ont été agressés sexuellement à l'enfance. Certains auteurs proposent que les répercussions psychologiques de l'agression sexuelle, tels le stress post-traumatique et le recours à la dissociation en tant que mécanisme de défense, peuvent expliquer le développement d'un trouble psychotique. Effectivement, le fait de s'adapter à un événement traumatique en se détachant de soi et de ses émotions négatives serait lié aux expériences psychotiques. Ces hypothèses sur le développement des troubles psychotiques suite à une agression sexuelle n'ont toutefois jamais été testées ni démontrées.

This research framework centers Indigenous principles, processes, and practical values at the center of the design. It inclusively captures four key components of the entire research process, which are based on Cree/Métis understandings of creating respectful research activities; enacting ethical relationships; being responsible for the gathering, documenting and analyzing the data, and ensuring that mutual reciprocity is honoured. The findings from this research were four main threads of understanding including roots of being, entanglement of roots, on nursing terms and living the practice. These were further articulated through ontological and epistemological considerations. What was central to this study was that Indigenous knowledge has always been fundamental to the Indigenous nurses' ways of undertaking nursing practice regardless of the systemic and historical barriers faced when providing health care for Indigenous Peoples. The outcomes of this research showed many important aspects to building Indigenous knowledge in nursing scholarship such as how nursing education and the delivery of nursing service to Aboriginal communities needs to ensure that
local Indigenous peoples and the community knowledge systems are at the core of nursing standards and healthy public policy."

Depression during pregnancy is important, not just because of the effects on the health of the mother, but also the possible harmful effects on the unborn baby and growing child. Women, who live in poverty, or newly immigrant, or who experience stress, are at even higher risk for mental health problems. 

My research program will increase our understanding of maternal mental health problems. It will help to find new ways to support women, especially those who do not live close to health services or who are living in socially vulnerable circumstances.

As a Chair in Applied Public Health, I will:
•Bring together women who have experienced maternal mental health problems, healthcare providers, and decision makers from across Canada to address maternal mental health policy.
•Develop a new online postpartum depression support group.
•Continue to train new researchers in maternal mental health.

Previous work suggest that we may be able to discover the factors that make breast tissue susceptible in early life to effects of agents that cause cancer, and to develop safe and effective methods of prevention to apply early in life. However, to carry out this research we need a relatively inexpensive, accessible and safe method of characterizing breast tissue in young women, something that we currently lack. Magnetic resonance is very expensive and there are few other machines that make the type of measurements that are needed. The objective of this proposal, a step toward achieving the goal of developing methods of breast cancer prevention for young women, is to determine whether the correlation between sound speed and magnetic resonance measures of the breast for teenage girls is sufficiently strong for us to use ultrasound rather than the more expensive and less accessible magnetic resonance in studies of breast tissue composition in young women."
Biomarkers of breast cancer incidence and phenotype,"['Boyd, Norman F', 'Martin, Lisa J']","['Aparicio, Samuel J', 'Connelly, Philip W', 'Greenberg, Carolyn', 'Minkin, Salomon']","['Biomarkers', 'Breast Cancer', 'Diet', 'Hormone', 'Lipids']",100000.0,182220,"We have recently completed a large long-term trial designed to determine whether reducing dietary fat intake will reduce the incidence of breast cancer. The intervention did not reduce the number of women who developed breast cancer, but we have found that body weight, and the total amounts of protein, carbohydrate, and energy in the diet did influence the number of women who develop breast cancer. Further, the tumours that did develop were smaller, and less often involved the axillary nodes in women who were leaner and who ate less fat and more carbohydrate in their diets. These results provide evidence that diet has biological effects on breast cancer, and the research proposed here seeks to improve and extend our understanding of these effects. We propose to measure molecules in the blood that have biological effects on the breast and whose levels are influenced by body weight and diet. We will assess whether these molecules mediate the observed effects of weight and diet on breast cancer. This research has the potential to define pathways and mechanisms that link body weight and diet to breast cancer.  The markers examined here have potential application in breast cancer risk prediction and prevention, in the monitoring of preventive interventions, and research into other factors, such as genetic influences, that affect levels of the markers will be stimulated."
"A novel approach from tobacco control for documenting public health practice for learning, improvement and impact","['Boyko, Jennifer A']",['N/A'],"['Ics Travel Awards', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Practice-Based Evidence', 'Program Evaluation', 'Public Health', 'Tobacco Control']",1500.0,364731,"Documenting public health knowledge and experiences can help others build on past experiences when planning and implementing future activities. Documentation of Practice (DoP) is a knowledge exchange activity of the Program Training and Consultation Centre (PTCC), a resource of the Smoke-Free Ontario Strategy. An evaluation of PTCC's DoP approach was undertaken in 2016. This presentation will: 1) explore approaches for documenting practice-based public health knowledge; and, 2) present evaluation findings pertaining to the ways in which public health practitioners use DoPs and perceive their usefulness. Public health practitioners whose work relates to tobacco control were invited to complete an online survey regarding the use and usefulness of DoPs. A small sub-sample was invited to participate in a telephone interview to explore key themes arising from the survey. Data collection was completed in December 2016 and a mixed methods analysis currently underway. The survey response rate was 29% (n=61). The majority of respondents (60%) were aware of at least one DoP. DoPs were used in many ways including discussion with colleagues, to confirm choices already made, and to prompt new thinking. The practice-based insights outlined in the DoPs were perceived as useful for reasons including ease of understanding, theory/evidence base, and credibility of the source. Ten individuals participated in interviews. Preliminary interview findings reinforce the survey results and provide insights about key aspects of DoPs that support different types of knowledge use. DoPs are a useful approach for sharing practice-based knowledge among tobacco control practitioners in Ontario and for supporting concrete actions towards impact. The DoP approach offers important insights for sharing best practices in tobacco control (programs and policy). Given the dearth of effective evidence-based public health knowledge exchange programs, there is a need to share this approach."

Yet very little is known today about the mental health of Canadian children. Since the last major study of childhood mental health, the Ontario Child Health Study (OCHS) carried out by our group in 1983, there have been changes in Canada which may put children at risk. These changes include increases in income inequality, in family dissolution, in the growth of visible minorities, perceptions of discrimination and in neighbourhood poverty. 

We therefore propose to study the mental health of a representative sample of Ontario children and adolescents aged 4-18 years (n=10,530) living in 7,020 families and 180 neighbourhoods and attending 240 schools throughout the province. The study is a sequel to OCHS and will be done in collaboration with Statistics Canada. The study has five objectives: (1) to estimate the prevalence of childhood mental disorders such as depression, anxiety and ADHD; (2) to assess how these disorders may be linked with other chronic health conditions and with social and academic difficulties; (3) to examine the extent to which families with children exhibiting mental health needs are receiving mental health programs and services; (4) to determine if the prevalence of childhood mental disorders has increased between 1983 and 2013, in association with increases in socio-economic inequalities; and (5) to investigate the larger contextual (family, neighbourhood, school) influences on risk for childhood mental disorder. Information will be collected from parents, teachers and older children, and from administrative records available from Ontario service providers. Results will be shared with policy-makers, who are collaborating on the study, and with the public for purposes of informing the development of new programs and policies to benefit children in Ontario and beyond."

We will study those whose mental health improves, remains the same, and declines, and under what circumstances. This information will be used to estimate the mental health needs of these children and to plan for services aimed at helping them. This study is the first in Canada to examine the evolution of psychiatric disorder and its risk factors among children with chronic physical illness. Thus, this pilot study will address important feasibility questions about how to best recruit children, obtain important information from them, and determine the resources required to conduct a larger study that will definitively answer questions about the mental health of these children. Children aged 6-16 years and their parents will be recruited from two children's hospitals (Hamilton and London) and followed for 6 months. Information on parent/child mental health and family functioning will be collected during in-home interviews. Physicians will provide clinical information on the children's physical health. If we achieve our sample enlistment and retention objectives, we will then seek funding for a larger study to address our research questions in more detail. The results will have important implications for patients, families, and clinicians including the identification of children who are at risk for mental health problems, the factors that influence these risks, and windows of opportunity to prevent or reduce mental health problems in these children. We expect that our findings will support the need to adopt approaches that focus more on the family in order to provide the best possible care for children with chronic physical illness."
Uncovering gaps in diabetes management during transitions in care amongst members of the Métis Nation of Alberta: a two-eyed seeing approach,"['Bradburn, Kelsey']","['Carriere, Chris', 'Randall, Jason']","['Cohort Study', 'Indigenous', 'Indigenous Methods', 'Metis', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative', 'Transitions In Care', 'Two-Eyed Seeing Approach']",100000.0,403902,"Diabetes is a complex, chronic health condition and significant health burden on Canadians. Approximately 3 million Canadians, or 8.1% of the population are living with diagnosed diabetes. Indigenous peoples (First Nations, Inuit, and Métis) are more likely to experience diabetes than non-Indigenous peoples and can face considerable barriers when attempting to access the care needed to best manage their health. The Métis are a distinct Indigenous group in Canada, although health data is only now slowly emerging. More research is needed to better understand the Métis population and their experiences in the health care system. Transitions in care (examples: changing from child to adult or adult to seniors' care, accessing resources, and traveling from remote communities to urban centres for care) may result in gaps in management which can have profoundly negative health effects for those living with diabetes. Examples of negative health effects which may occur during these periods include: medication errors, infections, poor blood sugar control, infrequent blood sugar testing, high-risk behaviours (drugs and alcohol), and suboptimal follow-up with a health team. Any of these effects may result in more frequent hospital admissions or readmissions. In Alberta, the Métis population experiences a higher rate of diabetes compared with non-Métis Albertans, although very little is known about gaps in diabetes care in this population, especially during transitions. Our aim is to identify gaps in diabetes management amongst members of the Métis Nation of Alberta who are experiencing one or more transitions in care (listed above). The results of this study will help to better understand life with a chronic health condition from a Métis perspective and highlight strategies which may improve health outcomes of the Métis population during transitions in care."

Many of these communities are understandably torn by their distrust of the sector and their desire to improve material conditions.  A key part of their challenge is their lack of knowledge of the likely impacts of mine development, especially with respect to community health.  This knowledge synthesis, which is driven by the interests of, among other partners, the National Aboriginal Health Organization, aims to respond to this need by unearthing and communicating existing scholarly and professional knowledge of the health implications of mine development for Aboriginal communities."
Examining the effect of parental incarceration on children's mental health in the United States,"['Braithwaite, Erika']",['N/A'],"['Ics Travel Awards', 'Intergenerational Impact', 'Mental Health', 'Parental Incarceration', 'Propensity Score Analysis']",1000.0,304357,"ICS Travel Awards
Background: In the United States, the rates of incarceration has increased at an exponential rate. In 2010, 1.7 million children were reported to have an incarcerated parent. Emerging evidence suggests that parental incarceration is harmful, but that negative mental health sequela might impact girls more than boys. This study will examine whether these results persist while adolescents transition into adulthood.
Method:  I will use the data from the National Longitudinal Study of Youth 1997 which is comprised of 8,984 young men and women. Parental incarceration was defined as having either a mother or father incarcerated before the age of 21. Mental health was measured at six time points, beginning in 2000. The statistical analyses will consist propensity scores alongside nearest-neighbor matching, a technique that increases the comparability of respondents with and without an incarcerated parent.
Results: A total of 1.51% of the sample reported having an incarcerated parent before the age of 21. After accounting for baseline confounders, there was no impact of parental incarceration on the mental health scale [beta coefficient = 0.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.18, 0.05]. Women reported less mental health problems than males (beta coefficient = -0.81, 95% CI -1.14, 0.48). However, there is some evidence for effect measure modification on the additive scale with women with an incarcerated parent reporting more mental health problems than males without an incarcerated parent (beta coefficient 0.88 95% CI 0.07,1.70).
Conclusion This study lends to a growing body of literature about the intergeneration consequences of incarceration. These results suggest that women with an incarcerated parent could benefit from targeted interventions in adolescence in order to mitigate and prevent long lasting mental health problems."

In addition to my operational responsibilities, research is key to my role in providing accurate and useful advice and knowledge about the epidemiology and communicable disease control practices for public health professionals. I have prior experience in a number of research fields such as epidemiology and qualitative research that I would like to develop into an interdisciplinary approach to public health issues related to my work. Building upon my own academic research background in public health will be vital to my position and professional development. 

This workshop will provide me with important insight into CIHR grants and the peer review processes, as well as how to begin my career as an investigator. Meeting experienced investigators and other researchers at the same career stage as me will help me expand my network of research contacts and could aid in future collaborative research projects. 

Given that I am in my first role as an independent investigator, I anticipate that the workshop will assist me in establishing my research career which will help me develop evidence-based resources for public health practice."

The Ministry of Health has a mandate to reduce the risk of injury and fatalities for active transport users, and, wishes to address potential inequities in bicycling and pedestrian trauma amongst vulnerable populations. To develop injury prevention strategies and to promote road safety in BC, the Ministry needs baseline information on the overarching patterns in active transportation crashes and/or injuries. To address this need, this fellowship will use a comprehensive database of crashes that include police records, insurance claims, emergency visits, and hospital admissions. It will provide detailed results regarding where, when, how and to whom crashes are occurring. The results of this project will provide decision makers with a foundational understanding of the current state of road safety for active transportation users, and generate evidence to create policies to increase the safety of active transport within BC."

Changes to CFG have been well received by the public and healthcare professionals. However, concerns have been raised. On the one hand, the new CFG's recommendations are more flexible. Recommendations are universal, non-prescriptive, and aim at behaviors (e.g., ""eat more often of ...""). On the other hand, this greater flexibility may be hard to implement, which may prevent individuals from meeting their nutritional needs. Maintaining optimal nutritional status is very important for older adults to maintain good physical and cognitive functions. In older adults, low intakes of vitamins, minerals and proteins can lead to frailty and increase health risks. It is therefore urgent to verify whether the flexible and universal recommendations of CFG-2019 are appropriate in older adults. Our research aims to estimate:
1) the impact of adherence to CFG-2019 recommendations on cardiovascular, cognitive and muscle health;
2) which foods make it possible to overcome any limitations identified or to further optimize health.
We will use data from the Quebec Longitudinal Study on Nutrition and Aging (NuAge). This unique study of more than 1,700 older adults includes many measures of health, such as blood lipids, muscle mass and strength. The high quality of the data will help to isolate, as much as possible, the health effect of adhering to CFG-2019 recommendations. From the NuAge study, we will investigate which foods should be consumed to address the potential limitations of current recommendations and to further optimize health. Our research will help to refine dietary recommendations and provide information on foods that can optimize the health of older adults, to live long healthy lives."

In Canada specifically, three groups have shown to be more at risk than others: immigrants, elderly people and Aboriginals. 

     There is very little information concerning current H. pylori prevalence rates and the impact of H. pylori in Nunavik. Due to this fact, we intend to initiate a series of planning activities and discussions with key stakeholders regarding the development of a research proposal to investigate the burden of H. pylori infection/disease in Nunavik.

To do so, this project will undertake a series of meetings with local health care providers and public health representatives in order to identify gaps in current practices and define the most feasible and acceptable ways of defining a comprehensive and integrated HIV/AIDS and associated co infections surveillance program that would be pro-active in preventing the spread of HIV among this high risk population.

A strong candidate that gains considerable traction in the recent years is statins, drugs that are widely prescribed for the prevention of cardiovascular events. Statins have been found to influence immunity and improve the antimicrobial activity of anti-TB drugs in animal studies. However, the effectiveness of a combination therapy of antibiotics and statins in human patients is currently unknown. Thus, we aim to assess the potential use of statin as an adjunctive therapy to TB disease by examining the relationship between statin use and treatment outcomes of patients receiving standard therapy for TB disease. Findings from this study will provide valuable information on the potential benefits of statins against active TB and could help guide the development of new therapeutic interventions."

PURE AIR: A Global Assessment of Air Pollution and Respiratory and Cardiovascular Disease within the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiological Study,"['Brauer, Michael', 'Yusuf, Salim']","['Burnett, Richard T', 'Duong, Mylinh', 'Hystad, Perry W', 'Martin, Randall V', ""O'BYRNE, Paul M"", 'Teo, Koon K']","['Air Pollution', 'Cardiovascular Disease', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Global Health', 'Particulate Matter', 'Respiratory Disease']",753674.0,304192,"Recent estimates suggest that 3.2 million deaths per year are attributable to outdoor air pollution globally, with 3.5 million deaths attributable to household air pollution from cooking and heating with solid fuels. These estimates place exposures to air pollution among the most important modifiable risk factors for global disease burden; however, they incorporate substantial uncertainty. In particular, the largest health impacts are estimated to occur in developing countries, where outdoor air pollution levels are high and household pollution from cooking and heating is common; however, few air pollution and health studies have been conducted in these countries. We therefore will conduct the first worldwide health study of both outdoor and household air pollution impacts on cardiovascular and respiratory disease, using an existing large international cohort: the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiological Study (PURE). This study has recruited 155,000 individuals residing in 628 communities in 17 countries and 5 continents, with current follow-up completed for four years and continuing for a further six years. We will use novel satellite-based approaches to estimate outdoor air pollution levels for all communities and complement this with targeted air pollution monitoring. For household air pollution we will estimate exposures using detailed information already collected on heating and cooking methods, fuel types and ventilation practices within study participants' homes. We will then determine the relationship between outdoor and household air pollution exposures with measures of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases as well as key relevant risk factors such as blood pressure and lung function. Overall, this study will provide an unparalleled worldwide analysis of the relationship between air pollution and cardiovascular and respiratory disease."
