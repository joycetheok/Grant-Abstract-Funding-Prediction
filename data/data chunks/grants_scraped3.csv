"Prevalence, perceptions, and chemical constituents of electronic cigarettes in Canada: Evidence to inform policy","['Czoli, Christine D']",['N/A'],"['Chemical Constituents', 'Consumer Perceptions', 'Electronic Cigarettes', 'Patterns Of Use', 'Policy', 'Prevalence']",105000.0,307724,"Tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the world and continues to undermine the health of the Canadian population. In Canada, cigarettes account for the vast majority of tobacco use. However, as regulations on cigarettes have increased, a new generation of products has emerged in the form electronic or e-cigarettes. E-cigarettes are novel products that deliver nicotine in vapour without the harmful chemicals found in tobacco smoke. Although e-cigarettes have been shown to help some smokers quit, there are concerns that they may be misused by smokers and may appeal to and encourage smoking uptake among non-smokers. Despite a ban on the sale of e-cigarettes containing nicotine in Canada, the prominence and sales of these products in mainstream retail outlets have increased. To date, there is virtually no research on the use of e-cigarettes in Canada. The current study consists of three sub-studies: Study 1 is a population-based survey that will examine prevalence and perceptions of e-cigarettes among youth and young adults; Study 2 consists of a marketing discrete choice experiment that will examine the influence of e-cigarette product characteristics on perceptions and interest in trying e-cigarettes; and Study 3 will test the chemicals constituents released by e-cigarettes. The study findings will help address critical evidence gaps and have the potential to inform policy regarding e-cigarettes, which is currently being developed in response to increasing concern over these products in Canada, the United States, and the European Union."

Obesity prevention in Canada: Fiscal policy interventions to reduce consumption of sugary drinks,"['Czoli, Christine D']",['N/A'],"['Obesity Prevention', 'Policy', 'Sugary Drinks']",35583.0,368876,"Consumption of sugary drinks is an important target for obesity prevention. Presently, several jurisdictions have introduced a tax on sugary drinks as a way to decrease consumption and risk for obesity. Although research indicates that a federal tax on sugary drinks could have significant health benefits for Canadians, several critical evidence and policy questions remain unaddressed. The proposed research program will examine policy interventions aimed at reducing consumption of sugary drinks in Canada. Study 1 will examine the health impacts of fruit juice to address whether its consumption differs from consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, such as regular carbonated soft drinks. Study 2 will examine potential ways a federal tax on sugary drinks could be implemented in Canada by analysis of current tax models for other substances, such as tobacco. Study 3 will examine the impact sugary drinks taxes may have on low-income individuals, given their high rates of consumption. Study 4 will identify other tax policies that may reduce consumption of sugary drinks in Canada. Study 5 will examine the marketing of sugary drinks to Canadian children and youth. Methods include scoping reviews of the scientific literature (Studies 1 and 3), and policy scans (Studies 2 and 4). Research findings will help address critical evidence gaps and inform advocacy efforts of the Heart & Stroke Foundation with respect to obesity prevention."
"Assertive HIV Treatment and Care among Women living with HIV: Support, Privacy and Self-Determination","['Czyzewski, Karina']",['N/A'],"['Assertive/Outreach Health Services', 'Hiv/Aids Research', 'Intersectionality', 'Qualitative Methodology', 'Self-Determination', 'Sexual & Reproductive Health', 'Social Work', ""Women'S Health""]",2500.0,347100,"Women Living with HIV (WLWH) in Canada are more likely than men to have experienced delays in accessing HIV treatment, have lower rates of adherence to HIV treatment and were found to have worse treatment outcomes compared to men. One way to increase engagement in HIV treatment and care is through the implementation of assertive clinical outreach services, including social workers. This study takes a critical look at assertive treatment and HIV prevention practices among WLWH.
We conducted 53 qualitative in-depth interviews with WLWH in Metro Vancouver between August and December 2015. The interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide co-created with WLWH and community organizations. For many participants assertive treatment was instrumental to link them to care, support adherence to treatment, access to social services and respite from social isolation. However, women also expressed an unease with assertive treatment. Our research shows a more nuanced consideration of assertive treatment and the impacts on women's HIV outcomes, privacy, and self-determination is needed."
Joint associations of volume and type of sedentary behaviour and physical activity with the mental health of adolescents from Northeastern Ontario: A longitudinal study,"['da Costa, Bruno G']",['N/A'],"['Accelerometer', 'Adolescents', 'Longitudinal', 'Mental Health', 'Motivation', 'Physical Activity', 'Qualitative', 'Sedentary Behaviour', 'Social Media', 'Sports']",90000.0,454962,"Adolescents engage in different physical activities (PA) and sedentary behaviours (SB) for series of reasons, such as playing video games for fun, playing soccer to socialize, or studying to achieve good grades. Engagement in PA has been typically associated with health benefits and excessive SB with illness, with Canadian guidelines recommending that youth should engage in at least 60min  of moderate-vigorous PA per day while limiting sedentary screen time to less than 2h per day for maintaining good health. Emerging evidence has shown, however, that not every type of PA and SB are equal, and the motivation for adolescents to opt for each of these behaviours also impacts their health. It is possible, for example, that watching hockey games may stimulate subsequent PA (e.g., motivation to play road hockey with friends), while playing online video games may displace PA instead. The interplay between these behaviours and motivations also impacts adolescents' mental health, but these relations have been seldom studied, and it is unclear how they occur among adolescents. The present project aims to investigate the interplay of motivation, engagement in different types of PA and SB, and mental health in two studies. The first study will explore adolescents' motives for engaging in diverse SB and PA, and the psychosocial outcomes associated with engagement in those activities through focus groups. The second study will use a longitudinal design to track adolescents' engagement in various types of PA and SB and their mental health four times over a one-year period. For each activity type, participants will be asked for descriptive details (e.g., type of team sports, which video games titles they have played). Additionally, results from study 1 will be use to identify important motivational and mental health indicators that will be measured on study 2. These studies will allow us to investigate how motivation, behaviours, and mental health are connected among adolescents."

Becoming a parent is a major life transition that brings additional challenges.  Mental health problems affect up to 20% of persons during the early parenting years  and can negatively affect parenting, the family, and child development. Growing evidence from general population suggests that persons with ARDs are at increased risk for mental illnesses, including depression and anxiety. While there have been important advances in identifying a range of factors related to mental health problems during this life stage, these studies have mostly been done in samples without long-term medical conditions. Disease-specific physical (i.e. pain, fatigue) and psychosocial factors (illness uncertainty,  disease-management stress) may be worsened for individuals living with ARDs when they become parents. To date there is limited knowledge on the factors related to mental health problems during the transition to parenthood for person's living with ARDs.  To address this important gap the proposed study will evaluate mental health during the transition to parenthood and identify related factors specific to persons living ARDs. Participants will complete an on-line survey assessing  a number of variables and a subgroup of participants will be interviewed to obtain a more nuanced understanding of the  barriers and facilitators to mental health for persons with ARDs during the transition to parenthood.  The proposed study will advance the limited knowledge on the mental health of mothers and fathers during the transition to parenthood. The findings will inform tailored  mental health resources and intervention approaches to better support the needs of persons living with ARDs during this critical life stage."
Evaluating Acceptability and Feasibility of an Enhanced Digital Intervention for Preventing Postpartum Mental Health Difficulties in Fathers,"['Da Costa, Deborah M']","['deMontigny, Francine', 'Grover, Steven A', 'Letourneau, Nicole L', 'Lowensteyn, Ilka', 'Mccusker, Jane', 'Rahme, Elham']","['Digital Interventions', 'Fathers', 'Mental Health']",218025.0,470212,"Approximately one in 10 fathers experience mental health difficulties during their partner's pregnancy and/or the postpartum period. Fathers' mental health difficulties negatively impacts parenting, family functioning and child development. A recent call for action recommends routine screening of fathers in the postpartum for depression and the importance of providing timely interventions. Yet interventions tailored to men during this life stage to reduce their risk of mental health problems are lacking. Interventions delivered over the internet have been shown to be a far-reaching, acceptable and effective method of preventing and treating psychological problems, but low usage by users is a concern. We have developed HealthyDads, a prototype bilingual website with accurate information on topics related to mental health, parenting and health behaviours, along with strategies to improve each. Findings from our pilot study generated new ideas for intervention features to increase engagement with the intervention. Increasing engagement with on-line interventions is critical to improving their impact. The main objective of this proposal is to evaluate the acceptability of an engagement enhanced internet intervention targeting the mental health expectant fathers and the feasibility of a refined evaluation protocol to increase retention at follow-ups prior to conducting a large-scale trial. This study will provide new knowledge on the success of specific features designed to improve  engagement with an on-line mental health intervention targeting men during the transition to parenthood. Ultimately, if found effective, this mental health program delivered over the internet will help to overcome the lack of father focused interventions targeting the mental health of new fathers."
Foodservice manager perspectives on the feasibility of sustainable menu practices in Quebec healthcare institutions,"['Dagenais, Béatrice']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,400547,"Food sustainability is a concept that is emerging in many countries around the world, including Canada. Sustainable food explores many dimensions related to food, namely its nutritional value, its quality, its social value, its environmental impact, and its economic and governing influences. The goal of food sustainability is to achieve better human and environmental health through these dimensions. Foodservices in institutions may take actions, termed sustainable menu practices (SMPs), to align themselves with these dimensions. The purpose of this research is to describe if including SMPs in healthcare institutions menus is acceptable and/or suitable, in the province of Quebec, Canada. In partnership with Nourish, a national initiative on the future of food in healthcare, this study is conducted out to allow the development of a practical tool for foodservice managers, helping them achieve SMPs in their menus. To carry out the research, 17 foodservice managers participated in the study, where they were interviewed about their perceptions on sustainable food in their foodservice. Results show many barriers and facilitators in including SMPs in foodservice menus, as well as different motivations set by managers. Knowing this information can help better adapt a tool meant to help foodservice managers, based on what they find most difficult to overcome when including SMPs. This knowledge can then guide Canadian institutions in adopting SMPs, providing all the health benefits of sustainability at the human and at the environmental levels."
Using Administrative Data to Evaluate a Population-Based Parenting Intervention,"['Dahinten, Susan V', 'Kohen, Dafna E']",['N/A'],"['Administrative Data', 'Child Abuse', 'Child Behaviour Problems', 'Child Education', 'Child Maltreatment', 'Mental Health', 'Parenting Program', 'Population Health', 'Population Intervention', 'School Readiness']",,204795,"Although there is overwhelming evidence that parenting has a pervasive influence on the mental and physical health, and social and emotional well-being of children, parents receive little preparation for the parental role. Triple P is a parenting intervention that was recently implemented across Vancouver Island. Two unique features of Triple P are that, rather than being a single program, it is a multi-level system of parenting support that offers service at varying degree of intensity, and it is designed to be offered on a population-wide basis. Thus, the purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate Triple P using archived, population-based, administrative data sources. Two research questions will be addressed: (1) Is implementation of the multi-level and population-based Triple P Parenting Program associated with benefits to children and parents? (2) What program features and community characteristics are associated with benefits of a universal parenting program for children and parents? The research questions will be examined using administrative data sources. Community-based outcomes measures will include: (a) school readiness, kindergarten teacher assessments; (b) educational outcomes measuring numeracy, reading, and writing skills (grades 4 and 7); (c) child behaviour problems; (d) child/parent mental health conditions; and (e) rates of child abuse and neglect, foster home placements. Overall, this project provides a unique opportunity to demonstrate the benefits of using population-based data to examine policy relevant issues related to child healthy development with no additional burden on participants, organizations, or service providers. It will provide valuable public health information about the efficacy of a universal parenting intervention program."

The Canadian Cardiac Arrest Witness Registry Think Tank: Working together to build an interactive citizen engagement opportunity,"['Dainty, Katie N', 'Zambon, Sandra']","['Brooks, Steven C', 'Buick, Jason', 'Cheskes, Sheldon', 'Morrison, Laurie J', 'Vaillancourt, Christian']","['Bystander Cpr', 'Cardiac Arrest', 'Knowlege Translation', 'Public Engagement']",16673.0,334728,"Out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a significant cause of death worldwide and in Canada, approximately 40,000 occur each year; that's one every 13 minutes.  Although past efforts have nearly doubled survival rates for OHCA victims, the current average rate remains very low at approximately 10%.  We know from research that a victim that receives CPR from someone nearby has 4 times better chances of surviving than those that don't, however the rates of bystander CPR are also alarmingly low, only 30-40% of OHCA victims receive CPR before emergency medical services arrive.

Our team has been discussing the idea of building a prospective, web-based national registry of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest witnesses. We feel it is the time to have a formal ""think tank"" in order to plan the implementation and evaluation of the ""Canadian Cardiac Arrest Witness Registry"" project and bring together important stakeholders and end users.  The goal of this meeting is to have a rich, multi-perspective discussion about the viability and details of building an OHCA Witness Registry that will ultimately lead to a funding proposal outline.   We will bring together key stakeholders from across Canada as well as international experts in bystander CPR and several previous OHCA witnesses in order to really be able to think about the implementation and evaluation of this project from all angles.  The Witness Registry has tremendous potential to be the perfect vehicle for a variety of types of citizen engagement that involve two-way exchange driven by the public themselves.  Most importantly this meeting will allow us to bring together a diverse group of citizens, not just the usual stakeholders, for ongoing dialogue, deliberation and collaboration to inform our bystander CPR research agenda moving forward."
Perspectives of Persons Living with Memory Problems and their Caregivers on Managing Eating Challenges and Swallowing Problems in the Community,"['Dakkak, Hana']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Dementia', 'Malnutrition', 'Nutrition']",1355.0,498000,"Older adults living with dementia may experience a range of challenges that impact their ability to consume an adequate amount of food and fluids, increasing their risk of malnutrition, dehydration, and negative health outcomes. In addition to providing adequate nutrition, mealtimes provide persons living with dementia with an opportunity for meaningful social interaction, relationship-building and expressing identity. While persons living with dementia prefer to maintain quality of life and well-being at home for as long as possible, this goal may be compromised by their experiences of swallowing difficulties and eating challenges. Swallowing problems and eating challenges can lead to negative consequences such as loss of eating ability, compromised nutritional status and quality of life, and stress in both persons living with dementia and their caregivers Few studies have examined the perspectives of persons living with dementia experiencing swallowing problems and their caregivers. To date, there is no information available on how swallowing problems and eating difficulties among persons living with dementia in the community are managed and their experiences in doing so. Literature reports a need to examine how persons living with memory problems such as dementia and their caregivers manage mealtime changes in the community. Therefore, the proposed study aims to understand the experience of persons living with dementia or diagnosed memory problems and their caregivers in managing eating challenges and swallowing problems in the community. Examining challenges faced by persons living with dementia and their caregivers will shed light on their experiences of ageism, discrimination, and other biases in healthcare, and It will inform health services of their needs to receive the support they need at home and improve care delivery. In addition, it will inform future intervention studies to improve nutritional outcomes and mitigate the risk of malnutrition."

who suffer from the illness and for their families. Asthma has several associated symptoms including wheezing, coughing
and mucus production. These symptoms vary among individuals in their range and severity. Asthma affects as many as 300
million people in the world and is the cause of 1 in every 250 deaths world-wide. The burden of asthma can be calculated in
both direct costs (medical care, drugs) and indirect costs mortality, quality of life, time lost from work or school, and reduced productivity). The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) report ranks Canada as 6th in the world in the prevalence of asthma in 13 and 14 year-old children. Asthma and related phenotypes are complex diseases with multiple genetic susceptibility variants, some of which interact with environmental factors. We need to better understand the causes of asthma 1) to reduce its prevalence; 2) to design better prevention and intervention measures; 3) to develop cost-effective management strategies; and 4) to improve diagnosis and treatment.

There is a genetic predisposition to asthma but increasing evidence shows that environmental insults such as smoking exposure, pollution,
viruses, and common allergens are involved in the development of asthma. This study is designed to see how these genetic and environmental factors interact to contribute to asthma. This knowledge could lead to preventative public health policies and/or new therapies."

This is increasingly being linked to mental health challenges such as PTSD, suicidality, depression, and substance use. At the same time, new concepts such as climate anxiety and eco-anxiety have emerged. Concerns about the mental health consequences of climate change have focused on youth, with the issue gaining attention through the activism of young people such as Greta Thunberg and Isra Hirsi. However, there is debate as to whether climate anxiety is always unhealthy or if it can instead be a healthy response to the current crisis. Furthermore, there is limited research on the role that adults and mental health professionals should play in helping young people with climate anxiety. This study will explore the impacts of climate anxiety among youth on British Columbia (BC), Canada, making use of both interviews and surveys. Twenty youth aged 13-17 will be recruited to participate in interviews. These interviews will explore young people's experiences of climate anxiety, ask how they cope, and elicit their expertise on how adults and mental health professionals can support them. Information from the interviews will then be used to create survey questions specifically about youth climate anxiety, which will be used in surveys given to 200 youth. The surveys will also have questions about overall anxiety, wellbeing, and young peoples' actions and knowledge about climate change. This will make it possible to explore the connection between climate anxiety and overall mental health, as well as whether engaging in environmental activities can be helpful, as some have suggested. This research will add needed evidence on the impacts of climate change on youth mental health in Canada as well as provide information on how to best support young people."

The mediating role of protein carbonyls in the relationship between Western diet intake and cognitive function in late life: The NutCog-NuAge study,"[""D'Amico, Danielle N""]",['N/A'],"['Cognitive Aging', 'Lifestyle Determinants Of Health', 'Mediation Modelling', 'Nutrition And Diet Patterns', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Protein Carbonyl Biomarker']",1000.0,388081,"With an increasing aging population, research continues to illuminate factors that contribute to cognitive function in late life.  A growing body of research shows the significant impact that diet patterns can have on cognitive functions. Consumption of a Western pattern diet (e.g., red meat, high fat, and low fruit and vegetable intake) has been shown to associate with poorer performance on tests of memory, attention, and executive functions (e.g., thinking speed). Despite these associations, the underlying mechanism that mediates, or explains, the association between diet consumption and cognition is unknown. The authors propose that oxidative stress, or an imbalance between free radicals and antioxidants in the body, may serve as the biological underpinning between diet and cognition. To test this hypothesis, data from a subset of the Quebec Longitudinal Study on Nutrition and Successful Aging was analyzed. In 351 older adult men and women, mediation analyses showed that oxidative stress, as measured by serum protein carbonyls, fully explained the relationship between Western pattern diet and the executive function, processing speed. Understanding the underlying mechanism between diet and cognition is important as it may be used to inform prevention or rehabilitation programs that aim to maintain or enhance cognitive health in late life."

Is Health Equity a Priority? Perceptions from Health System Decision Makers and Practitioners in British Columbia,"['Dang, Phuc']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,324437,"Health equity is the absence of avoidable or remediable differences in health between groups. The development of health inequities can be understood as a consequence of  multiple social, political, and cultural factors that give disproportionate benefit to some people, while disadvantaging others. Although the causes of health inequities extend well beyond the health system, reducing health inequity is nevertheless a key and growing policy focus in  health systems particularly public health.  This study explores the views of British Columbian (BC) health system decision makers and public health practitioners on health equity as a priority in their work.  We conducted 29 individual interviews and 25 focus groups with 171 participants from six BC health authorities and the Ministry of Health.  The participants represented two exemplar programs: mental health promotion and preventing the harms of substance use.  Participants included senior executives, public health directors, regional directors, medical health officers, managers, and public health practitioners.  The study design was case study and  we used critical discourse and situational analysis to develop an understanding of how public health decision makers and practitioners in each health authority and the Ministry of Health  talk about, value, and act on health equity. We paid particular attention to whether or not health equity is a priority.  Preliminary findings fall into three areas: (1) Health Equity Talk, (2) Health Equity as a Priority, and (3) Health Equity Strategies.  Decision makers valued health equity, but did not necessarily see it as a major goal of the health system in BC.

COVID-19 Impacts on Breast Cancer Screening and Care in the Caribbean and marginalized communities in Ontario.,"['Daniel, Juliet M']","['Anderson, Simon G', 'Azin, Arash', 'Chin, Sheray', 'Covelli, Andrea M', 'Date, Stephanie A', 'Lofters, Aisha K']","['Black Communities', 'Breast Cancer', 'Breast Cancer Care', 'Breast Cancer Screening', 'Cancer Support Services', 'Caribbean', 'Covid-19', 'Delayed Cancer Surgeries', 'Marginalized Communities']",498238.0,460369,"The COVID-19 pandemic has placed increasing demands on healthcare services globally with cancelled or delayed surgeries, and ICU capacity limits exceeded in many regions. Unfortunately, many Black and marginalized communities in Canada were disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 as they had high mortality rates due to being frontline essential workers (transit drivers, PSWs) and living in multi-generational homes. Globally, many healthcare services, including breast cancer screening, were paused during the initial lockdowns and this may have worsened breast cancer care and outcomes in Black and marginalized communities as they currently have the highest breast cancer mortality rate despite have a low overall incidence of breast cancer. In Ontario and the Caribbean, these populations are at higher risks for aggressive breast cancer and death partly due to lower screening and late tumor detection. Our study seeks to assess breast cancer screening practices before and after COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in immigrant Caribbean and marginalized communities in Ontario and in Barbadian and Jamaican women in the Caribbean. By determining the impacts of COVID-19 on breast cancer screening and care during the pandemic among these groups of women, our findings will help decrease the known gaps in breast cancer care and outcomes, and inform cancer screening and cancer care policies globally for millions of marginalized women diagnosed with breast cancer."

Elle est provoquée, entre autres, par la contamination des drogues de rue par des opioïdes, comme le fentanyl. Les instances fédérales et provinciales ont implanté diverses mesures, mais ces efforts s'avèrent insuffisants. En effet, les personnes consommant les drogues de rue seules à domicile (PCSD) sont trop souvent retrouvées dans les décès dus à ces surdoses, autant en Montérégie qu'ailleurs au Canada. Ceci s'explique qu'en l'absence d'autres personnes sur les lieux, ces consommateurs sont incapables d'appeler le 911 ou d'administrer la naloxone, qui est l'antidote pour les surdoses aux opioïdes. Cet enjeu est d'autant plus pertinent pour la Montérégie qu'elle se distingue par un nombre important de PCSD. Présentement, peu d'actions sont efficaces pour que les PCSD préviennent elles-mêmes les surdoses. Une approche prometteuse est de tester la présence d'opioïdes dans les produits, avant de le consommer, à l'aide d'une bandelette détectant les opioïdes (BDO). Néanmoins, son acceptabilité n'est pas bien établie chez les PCSD. De plus, l'effet du counseling sur les comportements de consommation n'est pas connu non plus. Dans le présent projet, il est proposé que l'acceptabilité de l'utilisation BDO chez les PCSD soit évaluée en premier. Ensuite, l'effet du counseling téléphonique par des intervenants formés sur les comportements de consommation sera évalué. Ce counseling, offert avant et/ou après l'utilisation de la BDO est important, car il pourrait favoriser un comportement de consommation plus sécuritaire. Les résultats obtenus supporteront une nouvelle intervention de santé publique à plus grande échelle. En déployant une stratégie, qui consiste (i) à tester la présence d'opioïdes dans les produits avant de les consommer seule à domicile et (ii) à offrir un counseling avant et/ou après l'utilisation de BDO, il est attendu que le nombre de surdoses chez les PCSD diminuera."
Accounting for the social determinants of health in cancer outcomes,"['Dare, Anna J']",['N/A'],"['Cancer Outcomes', 'Health Equity', 'Social Determinants Of Health']",400000.0,487439,"Cancer is the leading cause of death in Canada: two out of five Canadians are diagnosed with cancer in their lifetime, and one in four will die. There is growing evidence that important and inequitable variation exists in cancer access, quality and outcomes within Canada. Factors beyond disease biology - the social determinants of health (SDH) - can influence who gets cancer, what treatment they receive, and whether and how they survive. SDH are non-medical factors that influence health, and include the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live and age. They are important mediators of health inequity, the unfair and avoidable differences in health between individuals and groups. In Canada, our understanding of how SDH impact cancer patients and how they contribute to differences in cancer outcomes is limited, especially at the individual and health system organization (HSO) levels. This is a barrier to developing effective, context-specific equity-orientated tools and interventions for patients and communities. The goal of this research program is to understand how individual-level SDH impact and mediate cancer outcomes (breast, colorectal, lung, gastroesophageal, pancreas, primary brain) for patients and to use this knowledge to better address SDH within clinical care, in order to improve cancer outcomes and enhance equity at the level of the HSO. This work is embedded within the Unity Health Toronto (UHT) HSO, with a partner site in Thunder Bay Regional Health Sciences Centre. Both sites serve cancer patients and communities that already experience disproportionate social, economic, geographic and structural disadvantage prior to diagnosis. The UHT HSO impact goal is to develop research and programmatic capacity within the UHT Department of Surgery that improves the care and outcomes of cancer patients experiencing SDH-mediated disadvantage, informed by local evidence."
Gaining Insight: Understanding and preventing excessive prenatal weight gain in urban First Nations women.,"['Darroch, Francine E']",['N/A'],"['Community-Based Research', 'First Nations Health', 'Obesity', 'Pregnancy', 'Prevention', 'Qualitative Research', 'Weight-Gain']",72000.0,272845,"Obesity is widespread among First Nations (FN) peoples in Canada; according to Statistics Canada, approximately half of FN women are obese. Excessive weight gain during pregnancy increases the risk of poor maternal and fetal health outcomes that can continue throughout their lifetimes. Research has shown that pregnant Aboriginal women often exceed recommended weight-gain guidelines. Thus, the time period when obesity prevention efforts may be most warranted is during pregnancy. 
This research will use the social determinants of health framework to help to understand the factors that influence urban FN weight gain during pregnancy. The social determinants of health are defined by the World Health Organization as the ""conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age, including the health system."" Through community-based research in partnership with the Odawa Native Friendship Centre (ONFC) in Ottawa, Ontario, I seek to understand how obesity prevention programs with pregnant FN women who live in urban centres can be reflective of and sensitive to FN cultural practices. My PhD research will be divided into three distinct stages.  The first stage will use semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and a review of literature to assess the factors that influence urban FN women's weight gain during pregnancy. Using the results from the initial stage of the research, in the second stage I will use focus groups to work with participants to revise current prenatal health promotion resources to better suit participants' unique cultural needs. Finally, in the third stage, I will implement and evaluate an obesity prevention module within the existing pre-natal health program at the ONFC. 
This research has the capacity to address health inequalities in Canada through informing and strengthening the development of culturally-safe interventions and policies that can prevent excess weight-gain, adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, and obesity, for FN women."

We aimed to understand how to improve access/use of resources by Aboriginal women as this population is at increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes. This presentation aims to demonstrate how community-based participatory research (CBPR) culminated in the development of a culturally safe resource for pregnant, urban Aboriginal women. We conducted 15 semi-structured interviews with health/service providers that work with pregnant Aboriginal women and three focus groups with 25 pregnant/post-partum urban Aboriginal women. The interviews focused on barriers/facilitators of PA for this population during pregnancy. We engaged in thematic analysis of the data, supported by NVivo10TM software.  The interview and focus group participants revealed the need for culturally safe and positively framed PA resources. Specifically, the participants overwhelmingly supported the creation of an online resource (""app"") developed with/for Aboriginal women in the Ottawa community.  We argue that the use of CBPR in the development of health promotion resources for pregnant Aboriginal women is an integral component in the creation of a culturally safe, and thus, successful end-product. This CBPR effort led to the development of an online healthy living app developed with/for pregnant, urban Aboriginal women in Ottawa. To our knowledge, this is the first application of its kind for the promotion of PA and healthy living during pregnancy for this population."

People with lower incomes generally have more difficulty accessing health care. We suspect that the drop in clinic services not related to COVID-19 infection has impacted them the most, making them even more susceptible to diabetes complications, like dangerous high's and low's in sugar levels, heart attacks, and strokes. We will see if this is what is happening and try to figure out what we can do about it. 

We will use a rich data sources from Statistics Canada, the Quebec Statistical Institute, and the Office of National Statistics in England. These link information about age, sex, and ethnicity with income level, diagnoses from clinic visits and hospitalizations, and death registries. The information does not contain names or addresses. 

We will use diagnosis information to figure out who has diabetes. We will study information on people between 2016 and 2022, dividing this period into before pandemic and during the pandemic periods. We will use mathematical equations to figure out if living in a lower income neighbourhood (a signal for living with a lower income) is related to more diabetes-related hospitalization and death, whether this is worse during the pandemic, and how this is related to having less than two follow-ups per year and/or working in a job that does not have the flexibility of working from home. We will see if these relationships are different between women and men, and for people from different self-reported ethnocultural backgrounds. 
 
We will see if the difference by income level widened during the pandemic and whether it widened more in Canada or England. The policy differences between Canada and England will give us the context to discuss any differences and how these should influence policy going forward, as related to income supports, educational opportunities, and health care access."

The approach involves counseling to help people be more active (like walking half and hour per day), eat in a healthier way (more fruits and vegetables, plant based and lean proteins, less refined carbs, less eating out), and losing around 5% of their weight if they have extra weight (diabetes prevention). Recent studies show that in some people with early diabetes (less than 6 years, not on insulin), diabetes can be reversed through weight loss of around 10% with a low calorie diet with meal replacement products (called diabetes remission). Canadians do not have publicly funded diabetes prevention and remission programs. England has a model that could be adapted to work in Canada. We have networked with the leaders of the program in England.

Our team includes researchers who study diabetes prevention and remission, a knowledge mobilizer who assembled stakeholders to lobby for a national diabetes strategy, legal experts, economic analysis experts, health care providers, persons living with type 2 diabetes now in remission, epidemiologists, and biostatisticians. We will perform an analysis of Quebec laws to find out how the government or designated body can use blood test and medication information to figure out who has prediabetes or early diabetes and then invite them to join a program.  We will also estimate how many people in different areas of Quebec have prediabetes or early diabetes and how many fewer cases of diabetes there would be if they were offered a program. We will figure out the costs of different options of prevention and remission programs in Quebec. We will put all of this information together and present it to Quebec decision makers, in partnership with Diabetes Quebec. We believe that this will help us move towards funded programs.

Optimizing the city decision-making process through AI and big data for better population health and social equity,"['da Silva Carvalho, Maria M']","['Kestens, Yan']","['Data Science', 'Decision Support', 'Game Theory', 'Health', 'Optimization', 'Social Equity']",25000.0,404428,"Urban planning has a significant impact on population health, equity, environment, sustainable development, etc. Thus, there is an urgency in the development of reliable decision-making supporting tools to help plan future cities.

Mathematical optimization models can properly mirror decision making processes and, in addition, there is a vast literature on methods to tackle and thus, determine, an optimal decision. Consequently, mathematical optimization provides the perfect framework to assist urban planning.
Another factor to take into account is associated with the population's reaction to the policies in the context of urban planning. In this way, mathematical models must integrate the interaction of policy makers and citizens. Thereafter, a game theoretical framework would be suitable to determine the best policy, i.e., the policy that provides the best outcome in terms of the population health and equity. In order to achieve these goals, data associated with urban mobility will be used to determine the parameters of the decision process model.

This proposal aims to build a multidisciplinary steering committee with representatives from the City of Montreal, practitioners from Montreal Public Health Office, experts in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and population health researchers. Furthermore, it aims to devise a project using AI techniques to develop tools able to support the complex process of decision making in megalopolises, as mentioned above.

The objectives are to learn population utilities associated with urban mobility through big data, model their interaction with policy maker decisions, and develop optimization tools that can support their decisions by providing a clear view of population health and equity impact."

"The impact of a cervical cancer screening policy change in Ontario, Canada on social inequalities in screening: Quasi-experimental analyses","['Datta, Geetanjali D']","['Mayrand, Marie-Helene', 'Strumpf, Erin C']","['Cervical Cancer', 'Health Inequalities', 'Population Intervention', 'Quasi-Experimental Methods', 'Screening']",87704.0,337972,"Background: Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer among women worldwide. In Canada, screening allows for the early detection and treatment of abnormalities, thus cervical cancer is much less common. However, social inequalities related to cervical cancer screening exist. Low income women, immigrant women, and women living in deprived neighborhoods are less likely to receive sufficient screening, leaving them vulnerable to developing cervical cancer. Strategies like sending reminder letters directly to women to inform them it is time for them to be screened can increase screening in the general population. However, the influence of sending letters to women on cervical cancer screening inequalities in Canada is not well understood. 
Objective: The aims of this research project are to 1) examine the impact of sending letters to women on screening rates in the general Canadian population, 2) examine the impact of sending letters to women on inequalities in screening in Canada, 3) explore the reasons why women do not participate in screening, and 4) based on the results, engage in targeted dissemination of the research findings with policy-makers. 
Method: We propose to link several waves of data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) with The National Household Survey. Using statistical techniques, we will compare changes in screening rates in Ontario before and after a 2013 campaign was implemented to send letters to women reminding them it is time to be screened, to changes in screening rates in other Canadian provinces where this type of campaign was not instituted. 
Impact and relevance: This study will fill an important gap in the literature on the influence of reminder letter campaigns on inequalities in cancer screening, cervical and otherwise. Our findings will be transferred to policy-makers and knowledge-users in Ontario, Quebec, and across Canada to help adapt and develop more efficient and equitable evidence-based screening interventions"

This study aims to describe the financial impact of cervical cancer treatment on women and their families. We conducted our study at the Uganda Cancer Institute and Jinja Regional Referral Hospital from September 19, 2022 to January 17, 2023. Women were allowed to participate in our study if they were over 18 years old, being treated for cervical cancer, and able to provide consent. All participants answered a survey which included questions about their out-of-pocket costs, unpaid household labor, and changes in their family's financial situation. We also calculated their social-economic standing (SES) from what household items they owned and grouped participants into the categories of higher SES and lower SES based on their responses. In all, 155 participants from the higher SES and 183 from the lower SES completed the survey. Women from the lower SES were more likely to be older in age, have less than a primary school education, and have a more advanced stage of cervical cancer. Over 90% of women in both groups reported paying out-of-pocket for cervical cancer care. However, among all the participants, only 15 stopped treatment because they could not afford it. Women of a lower SES were significantly more likely to report borrowing money and selling possessions to pay for cancer care. With regards to unpaid household labor, women from both groups reported decreasing the amount of time that they spent caring for their children since their cervical cancer diagnosis. The results of this study demonstrate that Ugandan women, regardless of their SES, have out-of-pocket costs related to their cervical cancer treatment. However, there are inequities as women from the lower SES groups were more likely to borrow funds to afford treatment."

Socioeconomic disparities in colorectal cancer diagnostic pathways and diagnostic interval,"['Davis, Laura E']",['N/A'],"['Colorectal Cancer', 'Delivery Of Health Care', 'Diagnostic Interval', 'Diagnostic Pathways', 'Health Inequalities', 'Health Services Accessibility', 'Socioeconomic Factors']",105000.0,439489,"Within the cancer system, socioeconomic factors influence screening, stage at diagnosis and cancer survival. Less is known about how socioeconomic factors affect initial access to the cancer system through diagnostic pathways. Diagnostic pathways represent the route a patient takes from initial presentation of symptoms or screening to diagnostic tests and the final cancer diagnosis. The diagnostic interval is the time between initial presentation of symptoms to final diagnosis. A longer diagnostic interval is associated with later stage at diagnosis, increased patient anxiety and potentially shorter survival. Policies and interventions, such as rapid diagnostic assessment programs, exist to clearly describe diagnostic pathways, shorten the diagnostic interval and improve cancer care. 
Contact continuity with a primary care physician (PCP), defined as repeated interactions with the same PCP, increases participation in cancer screening and could facilitate quicker referral to specialists. A consistent relationship with a PCP may result in better understand of the patients' health history and social situation, which could result in increased awareness of cancer symptoms and decreased time to diagnosis, however, little is known if having a consistent family doctor shortens the diagnostic interval. 
This thesis will use routinely collect data to determine differences in the diagnostic pathways and intervals by socioeconomic deprivation and understand if contact continuity with a regular PCP mediates these relationships for patients with a diagnosis of colorectal cancer in Ontario. Diagnostic pathways and intervals are modifiable factors at the system-level that policy makers can act upon to improve equitable access, quality of care, and health outcomes for cancer patients. This proposal lays the groundwork for future studies using routinely collected data to examine the impacts of policies and interventions that outline clear diagnostic pathways on inequalities."

Seeking STI testing remains a deeply stigmatized behaviour for many young women, a reality that is unlikely to be fully remedied by online services (e.g., face-to-face enactments of gendered stereotypes can also be represented online through a text-based medium). Unfortunately, we do not yet fully appreciate how important social factors (e.g., social norms; stereotypes women's responsibilities for sexual health) affect experiences with online STI testing (particularly within vulnerable subgroups of young women). Thus, the proposed study will seek to better understand young women's perspectives on the ways in which important aspects of their social contexts (e.g., stigma; gendered stereotypes) affect their engagement in this and other sexual health promotion activities. Multiple data collection and analysis techniques will be used (e.g., focus groups and individual in-depth interviews; a Youth Roundtable to refine analysis from focus groups and individual interviews and a Youth Working Group will be formed to provide insights into the development and design of the look, feel and content of website.

Where someone lives also often determines their ability to access resources to help them deal with social and health issues. Concerns about resource distribution are increasingly evident in the area of violence recognized internationally as a public health issue. The primarily female victims of intimate partner violence have garnered particular attention given the tremendous growth in many countries in the range of resources that aim to intervene in or prevent this type of violence. Despite, and possibly because of, this rapid growth, little attention has been paid to systematically documenting what resources are available, where and for whom. This is a significant knowledge gap because knowing the extent to which resources are available, accessible, and utilized by the populations at greatest risk for intimate partner violence is central to understanding their overall effectiveness in preventing such violence. This research program will develop a national, geographically-referenced database and pan-Canadian map of resources that respond to intimate partner violence to examine patterns in geographical and social disparities in resource provision across the country. The main research question is whether communities adequately resourced will have lower rates of intimate partner violence compared to communities not adequately resourced. Beyond the findings that relate to intimate partner violence specifically, this initiative has the potential to be replicated for other types of violent victimization to determine resource adequacy and to contribute to more informed public policy decisions about resource allocation."

In essence, excluding these patients from trials does not serve them well in the end. This same issue is true whether it relates to vaccines for existing or emerging infectious disease threats or medicines needed to stabilize chronic health issues that affect individuals in their reproductive years, which each require specific medical treatments during pregnancy or breastfeeding. We will review all of the evidence and plans that have been proposed to safely include pregnant and breastfeeding people in clinical trials so that we can gradually implement these into practice. We will also survey researchers to better understand their needs. Finally, we will develop standard tools that researchers can use. In our approach we will partner with many successful organizations focused on drug prescribing in pregnancy including with members of Health Canada - the organization that makes decisions about medications that are studied and that go to market. On our team, we will include experts in women's health, health of the fetus and child, pharmacology experts, and epidemiologists.

Indeed, the rise of private automobile use in North America is associated with a wide range of negative health, environmental and social outcomes i. Accordingly, governments are actively promoting and incentivizing active (i.e., walking/cycling) transportation in an attempt to reduce the negative impacts of widespread automobile use. 

Despite the well-known health benefits of walking and cycling, their uptake in many North American cities lags well behind their European counterparts. The science in support of building active transportation infrastructure to facilitate healthier and more sustainable communities is ubiquitous, but implementing that evidence-base has proved more challenging for many communities.

 The broad aim of this grant is to help the Region reach its goal of achieving 12% active mode share before 2031. More specifically, we would like to leverage our recent light rail transit investments to increase the number of persons who are commuting to school or work using active modes of transport for part of their trip. Through this urban health policy opportunity, we will focus on improving high-risk intersections where collisions between automobiles and active road users are highest. 

Our mobilization plan includes three objectives: 1) to disseminate knowledge from the workshop to key staff members and councillors in the Region and municipalities; 2) to mobilize knowledge from community members, advocacy groups, staff and experts on a specific active transportation issue (high-risk intersections); and, 3) to foster new collaborative relationships between various stakeholders in the Region for future research and policy-making. In meeting these objectives, we will host a five-part Regional Tour and host a day-long immersive workshop to mobilize knowledge to improve high-risk intersections for increased AT in the Region."
Responding to the health crisis among street-involved youth in Canada: evidence to inform interventions and policy responses,"['DeBeck, Kora A']",['N/A'],"['Addiction', 'Addiction Treatment', 'Drug Overdose', 'Epidemiology', 'Injection Drug Use', 'Prescription Opioids', 'Prospective Cohort', 'Qualitative Research', 'Street-Involved Youth', 'Urban Health']",300000.0,302288,"Street-involved youth are extremely vulnerable to experiencing health-related harms for a variety of reasons, such as high rates of illegal drug use, poverty and neglect, as well as precarious living conditions, either on the street or in risky relationships. Approximately 40% of the street-youth in several Canadian cities report injection drug use. As a result, street youth are increasingly being recognized as among those at highest risk for drug related harms including HIV and hepatitis C (HCV) infection. Unfortunately, data to inform strategies to prevent injection initiation are extremely limited and injection initiation and HCV transmission dynamics among young people are not well understood. Another alarming trend among youth is the rapidly increasing misuse of prescription opioids (POs). After marijuana, POs are consistently identified as the most commonly misused drug among Canadian youth. There are signals that PO use may promote transitions into heroin use and initiation into drug injection; however, longitudinal evaluations of this phenomenon are lacking and our knowledge is limited to retrospective and cross-sectional studies.
To address these gaps, the proposed research plan focuses on: a) evaluating the impact and intersection of evolving drug use patterns and a range of individual, social, structural, and environmental factors on injection initiation, and HCV incidence among street-youth; and b) generating a body of evidence that will inform policy responses to address the crisis of PO misuse among at-risk youth. This research plan is based on an existing cohort of 700 street-involved youth who use illicit drugs, the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS), and the creation of a nested cohort of 200 newly recruited youth who misuse POs. The overall objective of the research plan is to generate evidence to inform and evaluate interventions to address critical health and social harms afflicting at-risk youth who use illicit drugs including prescription opioids."
Investigating and addressing elevated rates of HIV infection and disparities in access to medical care among Aboriginal people who use injection drugs,"['DeBeck, Kora A']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal Peoples', 'Addictions', 'Epidemiology', 'Health Disparities', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Human Rights', 'Knowledge Translation', 'People Who Use Injection Drugs', 'Policy-Analysis', 'Public Health']",150000.0,203265,"In Canada, Aboriginal people represent just over 3% of the population; however, Health Canada reports that 6-12% of new HIV infections are among Aboriginal people. These problems are of particular concern in BC where the 2009 Provincial Medical Health Officer's Report on the Health of Aboriginal People states that: ""The most concerning outlier is the widening gap between Status Indians and other residents for HIV/AIDS."" Furthermore, in British Columbia it has been shown that while the prevalence and incidence of HIV are significantly higher among Aboriginal people who use injection drugs (IDU), their access to HIV care and treatment is lower and they are less likely to access addiction treatment, placing them at an increased risk of experiencing drug related harms, including HIV infection and AIDS-related morbidity and mortality. To better understand what makes this population particularly vulnerable to HIV, the proposed project uses advanced epidemiologic research methods to examine whether specific public policies are related to health outcomes among Aboriginal IDU. Key policies of interest include illicit drug law enforcement, residential school systems, and adoption policies that result in placing Aboriginal children into non-Aboriginal families. It is hypothesized that the above policies will be associated with disparities in HIV incidence, accessing HIV care, and use of addiction treatment services among Aboriginal IDU. These hypotheses will be tested using data from existing prospective cohort studies following over 2500 high-risk drug users in Vancouver. Within these cohorts approximately 40% of participants identify as being of Aboriginal ancestry. By generating evidence that links public policies with the production of disparities in HIV/AIDS it is hoped that the proposed research will make important contributions to addressing and improving the overall health and quality of life of Aboriginal people use injection drugs in Canada."

The foundation of the proposed program of research is an established prospective cohort study of Vancouver-based street-involved young people who use illicit drugs. Through the integration of Peer Research Associates and an Indigenous Peer Collaborators Circle, the perspectives of people with lived and living experience of substance use are centered in this research infrastructure. Drawing on this platform three themes will be advanced: (1) Generate new knowledge in partnership with community collaborators that responds to BC Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions partner decision-makers' needs for data-driven adaptive actionable solutions to the drug toxicity poisoning crisis and other substance use related harms; (2) Capacity-building to launch the next generation of applied population and public health substance use researchers and policy-makers, equipped with expertise to apply intersectional and equity-centered frameworks in their work; and (3) Enable networking and integrated knowledge mobilization to strengthen the generation of responsive and actionable research evidence. Through generation of high-quality, new knowledge that meaningfully centers the perspectives of people who use drugs, capacity-building, and knowledge mobilization, the proposed project is ideally positioned to support decision-makers to take action that reduces drug-related harms and improves the health and well-being of people who use illicit drugs and their communities in BC, across Canada and beyond."

Therefore, in the proposed fellowship project I aim to investigate the intersecting relationships between neighbourhood and sex work environment at the macro level and the distribution of individual sexual HIV/STI risk patterns and access to health services among a sample of sex industry workers in an urban Canadian setting (Metropolitan Vancouver). This project is part of a larger study, a five-year longitudinal cohort of women in sex industry work in Metropolitan Vancouver that began enrolment in Jan-10, in partnership with local sex work and service agencies. Women will be followed up every six months over five years through interviews. I will use empirical data gathered in the larger project, and combine advanced social epidemiology methods and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping technology, developing a GIS database. I will also explore the use of novel complex adaptive systems approaches and develop a unique model that incorporates factors at multiple levels of influence, including social, structural and environmental, in understanding how neighbourhood environment impacts sexual risk patterns and health services access. The results from the research conducted during this fellowship will be exceedingly important in informing the ongoing development of health policy and structural interventions that improve the health of women involved in sex industry work in Canadian settings and will support ongoing knowledge translation of evidence into policy and practice through our extensive community partnerships."

Both too little and too much vitamin A can have catastrophic results for the developing child.  Vitamin A deficiency is a severe condition common in developing nations which can affect both the child and mother often leading to blindness and death.  The effects of vitamin A on development were first studied in the early 20th century using mammalian models whereby the mother had been fed a strict diet deficient in vitamin A.  However, too much vitamin A can also lead to severe problems for the developing embryo.  An overdose of vitamin A is a condition which has become much more prevalent in developed countries with the emergence of synthetic vitamin A derivatives used to treat a variety of skin conditions including severe acne and psoriasis.  There are numerous warnings and regulations in place in both Canada and the United States regarding the use of these drugs. However, many cases of exposed pregnancies occur in both countries each year with dire consequences including prenatal lethality, as well as various neurological and cardiovascular disorders in those which survive to term.  Our goal is to better understand the biological consequences of both an increase and decrease in vitamin A during early embryonic development.  To accomplish this goal we are using a variety of methods to expose early frog embryos, in which many developmental processes are shared with mammals, to alter levels of vitamin A signaling and examining the effects on development.   We have discovered a previously uncharacterized patterning event responsible for determining the head-tail axis in the early embryo.  Vitamin A treatment at this time point has severe consequences for the developing cardiovascular, respiratory and gastrointestinal systems.  In the future we plan to further characterize this process as well as examine the molecular effects on individual organs within the trunk of the embryo."

Building on our growing community-based research team's history of collaborative work, the aim of this project is to better understand how Animal Assisted Therapy (AAT) can assist Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal youth and adults in their treatment for drug addiction. Many individuals who abuse drugs have traumatic life experiences and use drugs to help cope with the experiences. Research has shown that AAT can assist individuals in dealing with trauma and other mental health concerns, but not a lot has been done in the addictions field.

Based on our team's extensive practice and research-based experiences with AAT, addictions and trauma, our aim is to develop a unique research project addressing all three fields together. Applying a One Health framework, which acknowledges the interdependent relationship between humans, animals and the environment to achieve optimal health, we will undertake a literature review, visit sites, review data and host a meeting to gain a better understanding of how dogs and horses assist in adult and youth residential facilities to achieve client wellness. We will focus on three key elements of AAT as a treatment intervention for drug abuse: the client's interaction with the program, the human handler, and the animal. The expertise of our diverse team members well-positions us to undertake this project while adhering to specific ethical standards for working with animals, humans and specifically Aboriginal people. 

The results of the project will allow our community-based team to incorporate best practices into drug dependency intervention programs. Organizing our team to gain a comprehensive and collective understanding of AAT, trauma and drug abuse treatment will provide the necessary foundation to develop a stage II CRISM Team Grant to establish integrated Nodes of research to cooperatively develop, validate, refine and deliver new treatment options with others."

Research has shown that pets can be beneficial to human lives, including therapy animals, but little to none has focused specifically upon addiction and mental health. Applying a One Health framework, which acknowledges the interdependent relationship between humans, animals and the environment to achieve optimal health, we will undertake an environmental scan and host virtual and an in-person meeting to gather feedback on Animal Assisted Intervention (AAI) and addiction-related research priorities and questions. The inter- and multi-disciplinary expertise of our diverse team well-positions us to undertake this project while considering specific ethical standards for working with animals and humans. The process and outcomes of this project will enable our team to engage with established networks in related areas and develop a larger-scale CIHR-funded study in this rapidly expanding area of AAI practice in Canada and elsewhere."

The Health of Canada's Aging Workforce: A Special Symposium at the 2016 Canadian Association for Research on Work and Health Conference,"['Demers, Paul A', 'Mustard, Cameron A']","['Arrandale, Victoria H', 'Davies, Hugh W', 'Trask, Catherine M']","['Aging & Health', 'Occupational Disease', 'Occupational Expsoure', 'Occupational Injury', 'Prevention', 'Sex & Gender', 'Work & Health']",20000.0,334769,"Work is an important aspect of modern life, with approximately 19 million Canadian adults in the workplace. But the face of the working population is changing; it is getting older. By the year 2021, the proportion of workers over 55 years will be almost 25%, 2.5 times what the proportion was in 2001. These aging workers and their employers face new challenges with respect to the physical and mental demands of work, and researchers are trying to understand how to make the workplace safer and healthier for older workers. It is potentially a major problem; workplace injuries and disease take a toll on individuals and society. Workers' compensation boards pay $7.67 billion/year in claims and over $2 billion/year in health care costs related to occupational injury and disease in Canada. In order to prevent these outcomes and minimize costs, it is essential to understand how the ""greying workforce"" affects occupational health.

This proposal describes a unique symposium on the health of Canada's aging workforce that will be embedded within the national 2016 Canadian Association for Research on Work and Health (CARWH) scientific meeting. This joint venture will encourage participation from important target audiences, stimulate new interest in this research area, and facilitate collaboration in aging, work and health research.

The symposium will address a timely and important public health issue by providing a venue for considering the research issues most affecting older workers. We have engaged with leading researchers who focus on occupational health in an aging workforce. This is the first time that a symposium dedicated to aging, work, and health will be held at CARWH. The symposium will be held over multiple days as a dedicated ""stream"" within the larger conference. This is a unique opportunity for researchers, practitioners, and policy makers to forge lasting connections that support future collaboration, research, and practice in the area of aging, work and health."
"#WeFeedYou, and yet...: Factors shaping temporary migrant workers' food security and health in Quebec's agri-food system","['Demmers, Théa']",['N/A'],"['Agri-Food System', 'Agriculture', 'Case Study', 'Determinants Of Health', 'Food Manufacturing', 'Food Security', 'Inequities', 'Participatory Action Research', 'Photovoice', 'Temporary Migrant Workers']",150000.0,495863,"Supervisor: Rosanne Blanchet, Université de Montréal

Quebec hosts the second-largest number of temporary migrant workers (TMW) in Canada's agri-food system; numbers are increasing yearly. Arriving mainly from Mexico, these TMW work in Canada for up to two years. TMW in agri-food produce and process food, yet many cannot access enough healthy foods. Access to food is a human right, important for health. It is influenced by many things (housing, transport, income). Studies show that TMW in the United States agri-food system have poor access to healthy food and high rates of disease, such as obesity. Even though TMW have asked for better living and working conditions in Canada, we don't know about their experiences with food access here and how this influences their health. To fill this knowledge gap and contribute to better conditions for these essential workers, I will study TMW's experiences in two parts of Quebec's agri-food system, the agriculture and food manufacturing sectors. These sectors share some characteristics but differ on others (work permit, access to permanent residency, transportation, housing). First, I will compare sectors concerning TMW's food access, living and working conditions, and health using a survey. Second, I will ask TMW to describe their food-related experiences in Canada with PhotoVoice interviews and ask for their recommendations about problems they see. Third, I will analyze the associations between sector characteristics, living and working conditions, and TMW's food access and health. I will look for similarities and contrasts between the two sectors in our findings. My research will help us understand how TMW's food access and health are shaped in Quebec's agri-food system, including what their food-related experience in Canada means to them. We will cocreate recommendations that TMW think would improve their food access and health, which will be useful for policy to better support TMW, the backbone of Canada's agri-food system."

Paternal depression is known to interfere with parenting quality and to increase the risk of children developing mental, behavioural, and social problems and evidence is accumulating that these negative effects begin in the early infant environment. Aside from these observations, research on paternal mental health during the period extending from pregnancy to early childhood is still in the preliminary stages since research to date has primarily focused on maternal depression. As such, data on mental health disorders among Canadian fathers and on risk factors that might predict such problems as depression and anxiety are almost non-existent. The FAME Team aims to promote the well-being of men expecting and raising young children as well as to improve health and social services for vulnerable fathers at risk for mental illness. To achieve these goals, the team members will build  models explaining the mental health and services utilization of Canadian fathers. They will propose and test innovative interventions for promotion, prevention and screening related to the mental health of fathers of young children. Healthy fathers contribute to the development of their children and the well-being of families."

Statistical methods to support diagnosis of childhood tuberculosis in the absence of a gold-standard reference,"['Dendukuri, Nandini', 'Pai, Madhukar']","['Joseph, Lawrence', 'Ling, Daphne', 'Moons, Karel', 'Nicol, Mark P', 'Schumacher, Samuel G', 'Van Smeden, Maarten', 'Zar, Heather J']","['Childhood Tuberculosis', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnostic Model', 'Imperfect Diagnostic Tests', 'Incremental Value', 'Latent Class Analysis', 'Statistical Methods', 'Test Accuracy']",256932.0,305859,"For many diseases (including many infectious diseases and mental illnesses) lack of a perfect gold-standard test makes disease diagnosis and evaluation of new diagnostic tests challenging.  We propose to develop statistical methods needed for the development of a diagnostic prediction model for childhood tuberculosis (TB), a disease for which there is no perfect gold-standard. TB presents a huge public health burden globally, and is also a concern among certain groups in Canada such as recent immigrants and First Nations. Accurate diagnosis is a key part of the public health strategy to control TB. Diagnosis of childhood TB must rely on multiple imperfect measures, some of which are specific for TB diagnosis (like smear microscopy or the GeneXpert test) and others which are non-specific (like assessment of signs and symptoms or chest x-ray). The risk of TB is also affected by other variables, such as whether the child is malnourished or has HIV. Statistical models called latent class models can aid in developing a systematic diagnostic rule for TB based on the imperfect tests and patient characteristics. We propose to develop such models to address the following objectives:  i) Estimation of the accuracy of the imperfect measures of childhood TB, ii) Development of a diagnostic prediction rule, and iii) Determination of the added value of new, expensive tests over routinely available measures. The main contribution of the project is that it will aid in improving diagnosis of TB in children. This project will bring together researchers in Canada, South Africa and The Netherlands. The methods and statistical software we propose will also find application in areas besides tuberculosis where there is no gold-standard test."
Evaluating diagnostic accuracy of tests and decision rules in the absence of a perfect reference test: Application to extrapulmonary tuberculosis,"['Dendukuri, Nandini', 'Steingart, Karen R']","['Dheda, Keertan', 'Pai, Madhukar', 'Schumacher, Samuel G', 'Sharma, Surendra K']","['Bayesian Latent Class Analysis', 'Cohort Studies', 'Diagnostic Accuracy', 'Disease Prevalence', 'Extra-Pulmonary Tuberculosis', 'Individual Patient Data', 'Meta Analysis', 'Predictive Values', 'Public Health']",229500.0,371086,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the world's leading infectious disease killer with an estimated 9.6 million new cases of TB in 2014. Though public health efforts typically focus on pulmonary TB, extra pulmonary TB (EPTB) accounts for an unknown 15%-40% of the burden and is associated with important morbidity and mortality. A key challenge to combating EPTB is the lack of a perfect diagnostic test, presenting a hurdle for disease diagnosis in individual patients, and also for estimation of disease burden and evaluation of new tests at the population level. To date most studies estimating disease burden or diagnostic accuracy have relied on naïve methods resulting in biased estimates. Our objective is to address this by developing a Bayesian latent class model, which is a statistical model that acknowledges the imperfect nature of all tests and possible dependence between them. We will focus on three common forms of EPTB (pleural, lymphatic, meningitis). Our methods will be applied to large cohorts of adults with suspected EPTB from India and South Africa, two countries with a heavy disease burden. We will also use data from an ongoing Cochrane review of the accuracy of Xpert for EPTB. The results of these different latent class analyses will allow us to estimate the predictive value of composite decision rules for EPTB, allowing us to estimate for the first time the extent of overtreatment and underdiagnosis. These predictive values will be used to carry out cost-effectiveness studies. The methods we describe will contribute to addressing the major public health problem of reducing EPTB burden. This project brings together an international group whose complementary methodological and clinical expertise in latent class analysis, systematic reviews and tuberculosis, is necessary to execute it. The project will support training of graduate students. The methods and software described in this proposal will be relevevant in other disease areas as well."

Climate change can prompt anxiety, sadness, and fear, what we call climate-related distress. A 2022 survey found that 78% of Canadian youth reported that the climate crisis has negatively impacted their mental health. This number is all the more concerning given that youth who experience climate-related distress may also be more likely to suffer from general symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Climate-related distress also affects how a young person navigates the world, views the future, and behaves environmentally. For these reasons, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and several healthcare organizations called for efforts to mitigate the mental health challenges of climate change. Unfortunately, the existing resources often lack specificity for climate-related distress and fail to consider youth perspectives.

This project uses a mixed-method participatory research approach to create a toolkit that supports youth dealing with climate-related distress. Phase 1 involves a two-pronged Partner Knowledge Synthesis, consisting of a youth-led photovoice participatory action research study where youth will share their lived experience of coping with climate-related distress, and a systematic literature review of coping strategies. In Phase 2, findings from both prongs are synthesized with youth co-researchers to create toolkit recommendations. Phase 3 focuses on co-dissemination of the toolkit through a website, infographics, and an actionable report.

This project is crucial for addressing mental health needs during the climate crisis, particularly among youth who may experience more severe distress. The youth-centric approach empowers them to shape the resources that are used to support them, in a manner that is actionable for those who support them, including parents, teachers, and healthcare professionals."

While the environmental risk factors for VTE, including prolonged bed rest and use of oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy, are established, the genetic determinants of VTE are less well known.  A promising strategy for unravelling the complex genetic architecture of this disease is to look for genes that control plasma levels of proteins involved in blood clot formation.  The rationale is that these genes are likely important in the development of VTE.  Thus, this research project aims to study the genetic determinants of plasma fibrinogen levels, a protein whose plasma levels are associated with VTE.  This study will use DNA samples from five French-Canadian families with a known genetic risk factor for VTE (the factor 5 Leiden mutation), as well as a family history of VTE.  These families are more likely than people in the general population to carry other genes that modify the risk of VTE.  Using a genome-wide association study, these modifier genes will be sought.  Results will be validated in three additional samples available through collaboration with French researchers.  The findings from this study will allow timely advancement of our understanding of the third most common and potentially fatal cardiovascular disorder, VTE."

Our research will investigate relationships between these social determinants of health and how they impact arthritis.

Using data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging (CLSA), we will first map CLSA variables to social determinants of health. We will then explore relationships between these mapped variables. We will also identify distinct groups of people with arthritis according to different social determiants of health. By doing this, we can understand whether these groups experience arthritis differently and if certain factors are associated with worse arthritis outcomes.

Our research team consists of experts from various fields, including health researchers, clinician-scientists, and patient research partners. Importantly, our team is diverse and includes members who represent the communities we aim to better understand through our research. 

The significance of our research lies in addressing health disparities among arthritis patients. To ensure that all arthritis patients receive equitable care and support, we need to understand how social determinants of health interact and contribute to the burden of arthritis."

During this time, fetuses and children are exposed to many environmental chemicals such as nicotine, bisphenol A, and metals. Our understanding of the effects of these chemicals on children's neurodevelopment is limited. We think that prenatal and early childhood exposure to all of these chemicals is associated with poorer cognitive, language, executive function, motor, and behavioural development in children. Also, these chemicals may have different effects on neurodevelopment in girls and boys because they can influence hormones, which in turn can affect the brains of girls and boys differently. Most studies have looked at the effects of single chemicals on children's development. Very few studies have examined the influence of many different chemicals and their combinations on children's neurodevelopment. We will use blood obtained from  mothers during pregnancy and from their children at 3 to 5 years of age to measure chemical exposures. 

The Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON) Neurotox study was developed to investigate pathways through which the prenatal and early childhood chemical exposures affect children's neurodevelopment. In this study, we will examine prenatal and childhood exposure to 77 common chemicals found in human blood such as caffeine. To do this, we will analyze 250 blood samples from mothers that were collected during the second trimester of pregnancy and 250 blood samples collected from children when they were 3-5 years of age. We have already assessed children's cognitive, language, executive function, motor, and behavioural development at 3-5 and 5-7 year of age.

In order to better understand the role that GBV-C may play in the development of NHL, I will be looking at the combined effect of both people's genetic makeup and whether or not they have been infected with GBV-C on their risk of NHL. It is important to study the effects of genetic makeup and the environment together because they can potentially modify each other's effects on the disease. A better understanding of NHL can help us find new ways to prevent, detect and treat the disease. For example, blood donors are currently not screened for GBV-C. However, if substantial evidence supports that GBV-C is an important risk factor for NHL, new blood screening protocols should be implemented."
A Bayesian Approach to Understanding Mental Health Burden and Service Utilization among Sexual Minority Men in Canada,"['Dharma, Christoffer']",['N/A'],"['Bayesian', 'Epidemiology', 'Health Services', 'Machine Learning', 'Men Who Have Sex With Men', 'Mental Health', 'Sexuality']",150000.0,457549,"Sexual minority men, which are gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, experience a high mental health burden due to societal stigma. However, our understanding remains limited due to challenges in recruitment and sampling. Population surveys from Statistics Canada are representative of 97% of Canadians, but up to 60% of sexual minority men have reported that they would not report their sexual orientation to a government employee. Linking these surveys to hospital records is another common way to identify mental health problems, although this would be missing out on those who do not seek care. Among sexual minorities in particular, this is compounded by the fact that many may choose not to seek care due to fear of discrimination, past negative experiences in the healthcare system, or lack of cultural competence from providers. Community-based surveys that are conducted by groups of sexual minorities could have fewer misclassification and underreporting biases, however, these will only capture those sexual minorities who are the most connected to the community. To remedy these issues, this thesis will propose the use a Bayesian approach, an alternative statistical method that will allow us to combine strengths and weaknesses of different datasets to produce more accurate estimates. Using this same approach, we will also calculate individual risk scores to predict improvement in mental health through factors such as seeking care, social support, outness, and resilience using community-based and population-based surveys. Building risk scores for mental health improvement among sexual minority men will help individuals to make more informed decisions regarding their care, especially in situations where care is not easily accessible (e.g., during pandemic times). It also allows public health practitioners to better target groups who need help. These methods can potentially be used in other hard to reach populations, which will improve future studies."

Insight into factors that differentiate adolescent mothers who are high versus low risk for abuse, and an understanding of predictors of resilience among this vulnerable population may aid in the promotion of healthy adaptation in spite of significant adversity. In addition, an understanding of the relationship between various forces at play at different ecological levels (i.e. individual, familial, community, societal, and cultural forces), has the potential to provide clinical insight, and be useful to the development of tools to prevent child abuse and neglect, as well as to the improvement of existing treatments for maltreating families."

These uncontrolled dogs cause an average of 1-2 fatal maulings per year, with unknown numbers of non-fatal injuries occurring.

A multiphase, convergent mixed methods study design was implemented to evaluate the perception of dog-related issues, estimate dog demographics and enumerate rates of aggressive encounters. Community-driven policies and communications were recorded, potential dog population management plans and education strategies were discussed, and implementation was followed. Alternatives were evaluated for successful reduction in dog numbers, bites and violent encounters. Community-based participatory methods of engagement with multiple groups in each community provided channels for two-way knowledge translation for researchers and community members.
Strategies regarding dog ownership and preventing dog bites vary significantly between indigenous communities, and are often dependent on the perceived threat of an imminent human-canine aggressive encounter. Sustainability of interventions requires key stakeholder acceptance and support, in addition to required resources. Participatory epidemiology sustains community engagement; providing opportunities for knowledge translation and communication as communities identify main issues, potential long-term interventions and possible solutions. Involving community members in research and data collection yields opportunities to appreciate the scope and breadth of problems and community opinions. Maintaining empowered communities, capable of achieving their goals for dog-human relationships, requires constant communication and education of all stakeholders. Fortunately, comprehensive community-initiated education has the potential to dramatically decrease aggressive dog-human encounters occur in indigenous communities in Canada."

The focus of the proposed program is on increasing awareness of what underlies our way of life, our teachings and ceremonies in order to go beyond the disruptions that colonization has caused. In this way we will foster a revitalization of our customs and traditional approaches to wellness - sharing and caring around nutritious food, as well as understanding the relevance of the nutrients of foods to health over the lifespan.

Funded through multiple sources (e.g., federal funds, the provincial home support program, private donations) Stella's Circle has maintained clients, who may have been otherwise homeless, in stable supportive housing rather than institutions. However, a noticeable trend among its clientele has been identified, namely, that the clients (tenants) are aging and their physical and mental health is declining. Through a research study, it was evident that tenants were experiencing physical challenges limiting their mobility which exacerbated their mental health issues (Hanrahan, 2017). As well, tenants had tenuous connections with their families of origin, and placed high value in the connections that they had within Stella's Circle and wished to age in this community (i.e., the Stella's Circle community). Further, as tenants age, Stella's Circle has encountered a gap in the community care system, and the personal care home sector which has limited capacity to work with this clientele. The proposed research is to explore a new model of housing that will identify staff models, skills, and physical infrastructure necessary to help this cohort of older adults with complex mental health issues. Ultimately, this cohort will 'age in place' in their home in their community."
Economic consequences of cancer in adolescents and young adults: a population-based Canadian national study,"['Di Giuseppe, Giancarlo']",['N/A'],"['Adolescent And Young Adult Oncology', 'Cancer Survivors', 'Economic Outcomes', 'Health Economics']",105000.0,417017,"Survival of cancer in adolescent and young adults (AYAs) has recently surpassed 80% resulting in a growing Canadian survivorship cohort; however, the economic outcomes of cancer in AYAs remain unexplored. A cancer diagnosis and its related treatment can result in psychosocial, occupational, and financial challenges in AYAs entering the workforce. Thus, it is hypothesized that cancer in AYAs is associated with immediate reductions in performance at work or school leading to financial impacts following diagnosis and throughout treatment, which may not recover during survivorship, compared to AYAs who do not develop cancer.

The objective of this proposal is to determine the association between a cancer diagnosis and the economic trajectory of AYAs in Canada diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 29 years, from 1992 to 2015. We will obtain data from the Social Data Linkage Environment at Statistics Canada which links individuals' annual T1 tax records with population-based administrative databases. Cancer cases will be identified from the Canadian Cancer Registry and matched 1-to-10 on age, sex, index year, and postal code to population controls who do not develop cancer. Subjects will be followed from the index date (age at initial cancer diagnosis) until the earlier of a new cancer diagnosis, death, or December 31, 2017. Multivariable generalized estimating equations will be used to analyze the data and we will stratify the analysis by age group, sex, and neighbourhood income to identify potential risk factors of disparities in economic trajectory.

Results from this project will address a current gap in knowledge on the financial hardship associated with a cancer diagnosis in AYAs. This study will deliver novel insight on the economic effects of cancer and will be used to inform future policy development and the potential need for tax incentives or other economic reform to ensure this growing population of AYA survivors has opportunities for a stable financial future."

Approximately half of all retinoblastoma patients have the heritable form of cancer, meaning that they have increased risk of additional cancers as they grow older, and their children are at risk of also developing retinoblastoma. Given the lifelong impact of retinoblastoma, it is important to understand more deeply the experience of retinoblastoma patients (i.e., individuals with personal experience of retinoblastoma and informal caregivers), and incorporate this information into the research process that aims to improve retinoblastoma care.

The goal of this proposal is to better engage Canadian retinoblastoma patients  in research. Specific aims are to:

1)identify retinoblastoma patients and invite them to engage in focus groups to uncover personal stories, new research directions, knowledge gaps, and communication preferences;

2)develop a prospective 'Research Registry' of people willing to engage in research studies as: study participants; members of research design teams; or end-users (i.e. people who wish to be informed of research results); and

3)develop the Canadian Retinoblastoma Research Advisory Board: a multidisciplinary group including, patients, researchers, clinician-scientists and advocates.

The top identified research priority is to improve early detection of retinoblastoma. We propose to develop a multidisciplinary working group that will develop a research proposal to solve the top priority. Participants will include members of CRRAB, interested patients identified through the CRRAB electronic patient registry, researchers with an interest or expertise in early detection, clinicians who diagnose and treat retinoblastoma, and advocacy groups that raise awareness about presenting signs of retinoblastoma. Together, all aspects of early detection will be considered (i.e. awareness of the public, knowledge of clinical teams, technological approaches to detection and diagnosis) to devise a research protocol to address the priority.

How is gestational weight gain between clinical visits best estimated in twin and singleton pregnancies?,"['Dimitris, Michelle C']",['N/A'],"['Epidemiological Methods', 'Ics Travel Awards', 'Maternal Health', 'Perinatal Epidemiology', 'Statistics']",1000.0,400540,"Maternal weight gain is a potentially modifiable characteristic of pregnancy that has been associated with the health of both mothers and children. Traditional studies often explore the total or rate of maternal weight gain in pregnancy; however, these measures are imprecise, and their cumulative nature may bias results in studies of some health outcomes. Emerging research aims to leverage serial maternal weight measurements to more reliably investigate this association. However, research is often constrained by limited availability of information obtained at discrete gestational ages.  Therefore, this research aimed to investigate and compare methods for estimating maternal weight between clinical visits. Two large clinical chart abstractions studies in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania were leveraged to address this objective, although results are likely similarly applicable to pregnancies in Canada. Among the wealth of longitudinal data collected, we retained select maternal weight measurements (i.e. pre-pregnancy/delivery weight, as well as weight measured at first prenatal and glucose screening visits) in models to predict measurements at all other visits. We then calculated the difference between measured and predicted maternal weight, and summarized these differences (i.e. median, range, and mean squared error) to determine the relative performance of each model. Overall, 16 models were explored; 4 individual models that considered each mother's data separately, and 12 pooled models that borrowed information from all mothers to estimate each mother's pattern of weight change throughout pregnancy. We found that individual and pooled models that incorporated considerable variation in both pre-pregnancy weight and pattern of weight gain performed best. It is anticipated that these results will inform both ongoing and future studies investigating the relationship between maternal weight gain and pregnancy outcomes in North America and internationally."

Although these measures were necessary to limit the transmission of the virus, there are reasons to be concerned about their impact on the adolescents, who are probably the group with the greatest need to socialize with their peers. In fact, it may have been more difficult for adolescents during the pandemic to have their first romantic relationships, to be involved in schools or get a job. Some youth may be even more vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic, namely, those having experienced prior adverse life events such as child maltreatment or bullying, and adolescents belonging to a sexual and gender minority (LGBTQ2+). Indeed, independent of the pandemic, these two groups tend to experience greater rates of stigma, social isolation, and mental health issues compared to their non-victimized, non-minoritized peers. Moreover, as the pandemic deprived them of the majority of extra-familial supports and/or programs, it may have been more difficult for these adolescents to cope. The proposed research will examine the effects of child maltreatment and bullying on youth's mental health in the aftermath of the pandemic (e.g., COVID-related stress, post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety/depression, alcohol and drug) and the impacts of support and extra-curricular activities on their well-being. We will also examine these outcomes among sexual and gender minority youth. This study will document the progression of mental health among 3,900 adolescents, before (school year 2019-2020), during (school year 2020-2021) and after (school year 2021-2022, present proposal) the COVID-19 pandemic.

The focus on the development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines has drawn attention away from the extent to which the lack of confidence in vaccines remains a persistent challenge, particularly among Indigenous, Black and other racialized groups in Canada and in other countries. The introduction of new vaccines is not necessarily followed by trust in (i) the effectiveness and safety of vaccines; (ii) the system that delivers them, including the reliability and competence of the health services and health professionals and (iii) the motivations of policy-makers who decide on the needed vaccines. Several historical and contemporary dimensions interplay to influence vaccine hesitancy. In this project, we seek to understand the role religion and collaborations with faith-based organizations play in increasing vaccine uptake. Currently, public health interventions to address vaccine confidence have relied on faith-based leaders as trusted messengers or used houses of worship as vaccine clinics.  We will identify and evaluate community-centered interventions that aim to improve vaccine confidence among Black, South Asian, Middle Eastern, or newcomer communities particularly in the region of Peel (Ontario). Our project will help contribute knowledge about what interventions work, for whom, under what contextual circumstances, and whether these interventions are scalable in equitable ways.

Research from the UK and US suggest that the prevalence of child mental disorders has increased over the past 30 years, but these secular trends have not been examined in Canada. Substantial economic and demographic changes have occurred in Canada over the past 30 years, including increases in income inequality, poverty, and family dissolution that may compromise children's mental health. Further, the impact of lifestyle (e.g. sleep, diet, exercise), and factors unique to the current generation of Canadian children, such as increased technology use, have not been assessed. 

Using data from the 1983 and 2014 Ontario Child Health Study (OCHS), Student Mental Health Survey (SMHS), Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey (OSDUHS), and National Longitudinal Survey of Canadian Children and Youth (NLSCY), the objectives of the proposed study are to: 1.Quantify changes in 6 month prevalence rates of common mental disorders in children between 1983 and 2014; 2.Contrast the impact of socioeconomic (SES), demographic and life style risk factors on child mental disorders between 1983 to 2014; and 3.Quantify the impact of technology use and other risks unique to the current generation of children on common mental disorders. 

The 1983 and 2014 OCHS contain information on 3,294 children and 7,000 children respectively, both using the same, validated measures for assessing mental disorders. The 2014 OCHS was designed to sample a range of SES families and neighbourhoods, allowing to understand the true impact of SES on child mental disorders. The NLSCY provides longitudinal mental health data for 14,000 Canadian youths aged 4-11 years between 1994-2009. The SMHS includes data from over 30,000 Ontario students and the OSDUHS is a survey that contains mental health and substance use data for Ontario students in grade 7-12, repeated every two years since 1977."

"Emergency contraception in Albania: A multi-methods study of awareness, attitudes and practices","['Doci, Florida']",['N/A'],['Ics Planning And Dissemination Grants'],2100.0,383778,"Objective(s):
At 11%, the contraceptive prevalence rate with modern methods is relatively low in Albania, even though an array of methods are freely available. Abortion remains the mainstay of family planning in the country. Emergency contraception (EC) could play a significant role in addressing women's need for an effective and discreet method of pregnancy prevention. Although two different levonorgestrel-only EC pills (NorLevo® and Postinor®) are available directly from pharmacies, use remains limited. This study aimed to explore awareness, knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward EC in Albania.

Design and methods:
In 2016, we conducted a multi-methods qualitative study with women and service providers in Albania. We invited women to report on their knowledge of, attitudes toward, and practices surrounding EC in an online survey and through six focus group discussions. Additionally, we conducted 19 in-depth semi-structured interviews with key informants and 16 structured interviews with retail pharmacists in Tirana. We analysed our data using descriptive statistics and for content and themes.

Results:
Our findings suggest that EC is widely available in pharmacies in Albania. However, women face numerous barriers to accessing this form of contraception. Lack of knowledge among providers and women, misconceptions about hormonal contraceptives, misinformation about the side effects of and risks associated with EC, lack of public sector provision, and stigma and fear of judgment among women pose obstacles to timely access.

Conclusions:
Misinformation about EC among women and providers in Albania appears common. Training of health service providers, raising awareness among women, and developing Albanian-language and culturally resonant materials for distribution could play a key role in improving knowledge and uptake of EC."

Importantly, older adults are also not getting enough daily activity. This increases their chances of developing diseases such as cancer and heart disease. In order to help older adults sit less and move more, we will develop a program that slowly progresses individuals from sedentary lifestyles to more active lifestyles. For this research, we first want to know what older adults, exercise and recreation professionals, and healthcare professionals think of this approach, and what elements they would want in such a program. Once we hear from them, we will create the program, and deliver it in a healthcare or community setting. Health and recreation professionals will tell older adults about the program, and they will be signed up for the program. We hope that by helping older adults get started with reducing daily sitting, they will progress to adding more movement into their day. This change is expected to have a great impact on their physical and mental health."

Traditional cars are also problematic as they increase air pollution, which can negatively impact our health and quality of life. There are electric options, but cities often do not have the infrastructure to support these options. The purpose of this grant is to create a group of people in the City of Oshawa and Region of Durham who are committed to coming up with creative solutions to the issue of urban mobility. This group will include researchers, staff from local municipalities, community partners, and industry partners, who will create research groups and action items that can be achieved over the next 5 years. It is hoped that this will help shift the focus from traditional transportation to the broader topic of urban mobility with a particular emphasis on increasing physical activity, decreasing air pollution, creating more space, and ultimately, creating a healthy city."

Our goal is to organize an event where thought-provoking speakers and panelists provide municipal staff, advocates, residents, and researchers with ideas on how to implement and evaluate equitable active transportation interventions. To ensure that these individuals are supported beyond the one-day event, we will also form the Public, Active, Clean, and Equitable (PACE) Mobility Group. This group will consist of researchers and knowledge users such as municipal staff, and will work to support communities across Canada who want to improve active transportation. We will also host community events to help residents in our community winterize their bikes or walking shoes, and to support them with biking to work. Together, we hope that this work, and the collaborations that result from it, will start our mid-sized city along a positive pathway to changing the way we think about mobility."
Supportive social relationships and employment-related factors as determinants of health during young adults' transition to work.,"['Domene, Jose F']",['N/A'],"['Employment And Health', 'Social Supports And Health', 'Transition To Work', 'Young Adults']",25905.0,210462,"In this study, we will focus on the relationships between two potentially important determinants of health during the transition to work: The quality of the employment that individuals obtain (or fail to obtain) and their access to supportive social relationships. As young adults complete their education and attempt to transition into the world of work, the failure to obtain full-time, long-term employment in their chosen field can have numerous detrimental consequences on their physical and mental health. In Canada, this link between health and the transition to work is complicated by large regional differences in unemployment rates, which results in a situation where many young adults face the choice between leaving their home communities and support systems in order to pursue work, or remaining connected to their system of supportive relationships and facing the prospect of under/unemployment or taking any available work, rather than pursuing their aspired career path. Thus, the aim of the proposed study is to identify how employment and support work together as determinants of health in young adults. 

Data will be drawn from Cycle 7 of the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY), a comprehensive, nationally representative survey of youth in Canada, jointly maintained by Statistics Canada and Human Resources and Social Development Canada. Data will be analyzed using advanced statistical modelling techniques. Separate models will be tested for each gender, and for 3 different aspects of health: Physical, mental, and substance use. 

As the first to examine this specific research question within a Canadian context, this study has potential for developing future health promotion policies and interventions in regions of the country where young adults must make difficult choices between pursuing sub-optimal work opportunities in their home communities or moving away from their support networks to pursue their aspirations in other regions."
Longitudinal Trajectories of Depressive Symptoms through the Transition from Post-secondary Education into the Workforce: The Influence of Social Supports and Employment Characteristics,"['Domene, Jose F']","['Arim, Rubab G']","['Depression', 'Employment And Mental Health', 'Social Supports And Mental Health', 'Transition To Work', 'Young Adults']",61703.0,265409,"CONTEXT We will examine changes in depressive symptoms as young adults transition into the workforce, and assess how this is influenced by employment quality and access to social support. As young adults attempt to transition into the workforce, the failure to obtain full-time, long-term employment in their field can have negative consequences on mental health. In Canada, this link between depression and the transition to work is complicated by provincial differences in unemployment rates. As a result, many young adults must choose between leaving their communities and supports to pursue their career goals, or remaining connected to their support system and facing the prospect of unemployment or taking any kind of work that is available. This study will not only elucidate the links between mental health, employment and social supports during this developmental period, but will also examine whether these relationships vary by sex and geographic region.

METHOD Data will be drawn from several cycles of the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, a comprehensive, population-based survey of youth across Canada, jointly maintained by Statistics Canada and Human Resources and Social Development Canada. Data will be analyzed using advanced statistical modelling techniques.

IMPORTANCE In the current economic climate, it is important to study links between depression and the transition to work. This will provide information to help shape future social policies and intervention strategies. For example, if low quality work leads to worse mental health outcomes, this would highlight the need to assist unemployed youth to launch their long-term career goals, instead of only helping them to find any available work. Our study also extends existing knowledge to a Canadian social context and lays the groundwork for future research on intervention strategies to alleviate possible negative mental health consequences of failing to make an optimal transition to work."
Quality of Life and Symptom Change Over Time in Colorectal Cancer Patients,"['Donia, Joseph']",['N/A'],"['Colorectal Cancer', 'Long-Term Cancer Outcomes', 'Prospective', 'Psychosocial Oncology', 'Quality Of Life', 'Symptom Change']",17500.0,252809,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer for Canadians (Canadian Cancer Society, 2011). Compared to healthy controls, CRC survivors report impaired quality of life (QOL) (Arndt et al., 2004). Survivors report physical and psychological symptoms post-treatment, including sexual dysfunction, depression, fatigue, and bowel dysfunction (e.g., Harrington et al., 2010).  Although cross-sectional studies have examined the relationship between QOL and symptom severity in this population, little research has investigated the relationship of symptom change to QOL prospectively.  The proposed research will expand on extant research by addressing the impact of long-term physical and psychological symptoms on QOL over time.

As part of a larger longitudinal study examining post-traumatic growth and post-traumatic stress disorder among colorectal cancer patients (PI: Dr. Stacey Hart, funded by CIHR New Investigator award in Gender and Health and Lance Armstrong Foundation Research Award), the proposed research will utilize data from CRC patients (N=139) previously recruited from outpatient surgery practices.  Patients were recruited at the time of diagnosis and completed validated self-report measures of symptom severity and QOL at four time points: prior to surgery (baseline), and 6, 12, and 18 months post-surgery. Measures included the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Centre Bowel Function Instrument, the SF-36 (QOL), the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Fatigue Scale, the Insomnia Severity Index, the International Index of Erectile Function, and the Female Sexual Function Index.

It is hoped that this research will address a gap in the current literature regarding the long-term physical and psychological outcomes among survivors of colorectal cancer, and how these outcomes may change over the course of cancer survivorship."

Each province and territory was then responsible for defining the rules of sale (public/private), use (age, possession limits, and location) and control (enforcement and traffic safety). The province of Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) had five main goals: 1) protect public health by providing access to a safe source of cannabis, encouraging low-risk use, by those who choose to use it, and keeping it out of the hands of children; 2) promote safety on roads, public spaces and workplaces; 3) reduce the burden on the criminal justice system; 4) keep profits out of the hands of criminals; and 5) support new business opportunities. This resulted in a plan that includes private and public retail sales. Private retailers can sell to the public in one of four types of in-person locations, while the public retailer (NL Liquor Corporation) controls all online sales. This multiple-retail style approach is unique to NL, and policy makers are interested in seeing whether or not this model is meeting health and safety goals.

In collaboration with policy makers, we are proposing an evaluation that explores both the process of retail sales and the important health and safety outcomes relevant to cannabis use. To examine the process of retail sales, we will look closely at legal versus illegal purchasing patterns, access and use across geographical areas and barriers and facilitators to operating a safe and viable businesses. To examine some of the direct impacts on health (e.g., mental illness, accidental injury) and impact on social determinants of health (e.g., education, employment) we will collect and analyze data from population surveys, sales records, enforcement data, and health records. These data will be used to do provincial descriptive analyses and monitor changes over time with special attention to differences based on age, gender, and place of residence."

Intersectional research  addresses health equality by illuminating interlocking forms of oppression and identifying context-specific solutions to health disparities. However, deeper engagement with intersectionality as an analytic framework is needed if this body of research is to have robust and effective outcomes. It is imperative to advance knowledge in the ""doing"" of intersectional qualitative research, and to support and prepare the next generation of diverse health scholars for this complex work.

Thinking Qualitatively: Doing Intersectionality (TQ:DI) addresses this need through a virtual four-day learning and knowledge exchange event (spring 2023). TQ:DI brings together 150 pre/early career scholars and 15 mid-career and senior scholars. Part I (Days 1 & 2) will offer workshops for disseminating research and developing methodological knowledge. Part 2 (Days 3 & 4) will offer an intensive opportunity for research-sharing, knowledge development, and mentoring among 32 new and 8 experienced intersectional health researchers. Senior scholars will pool their knowledge on the ""state of the field"" and effective mentoring, and new scholars will present and receive feedback on the oral and written presentation of their current intersectional qualitative health research projects. Across the four days, senior scholars will offer four public keynote addresses. TQ:DI will actively recruit scholars at all levels from Canada and internationally, and whose own careers are shaped by intersecting social identities.

TQ:DI will result in deepened understanding of intersectionality and intersectional mentoring, a vibrant global network of diverse health scholars, and public lectures and an academic article advancing intersectional qualitative health research."

We want to find the relationship between sleep disorders and a number of other diseases. We want to find if there is a possibility of community-based diagnosis and treatment for sleep disorders.   
Based on our previous work we observed the likelihood that serious sleep problems were common in First Nations People. Low income, poor housing, too many people in small houses, and body weight were related to sleep disorders. Poor sleep and lack of sleep are associated with a number of diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. 
We will collect information on personal factors such as age and body weight. We will collect information on home factors such as housing and income. We will collect information on a list of medical conditions. We will conduct home sleep studies to diagnose sleep apnea. We will administer a small wrist-watch-like unit, worn on the wrist to measure sleep deprivation in children and adults. 
First Nations people have not been treated fairly for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. Based on our previous work, there has recently been a change in the policy for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders in First Nations People. We consider this is a major potential change for First Nations people in Canada. This will improve care by improving access, reducing waiting times, resulting in better treatment, and result in financial savings in transportation costs.

While they are highly efficacious in controlling blood glucose levels, sulfonylureas can increase the risk of hypoglycemia, a potentially fatal adverse event. Importantly, drug-drug interactions occurring during the concomitant use of sulfonylureas with other medications could modify this risk. Indeed, warfarin, a blood thinner broadly used in the prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and in the prevention and treatment of thrombosis, can interact with sulfonylureas, thereby increasing their blood levels and potentially their hypoglycemic risk. However, available clinical data on this interaction are scarce and of low quality. Thus, our population-based cohort study will compare the risk of severe hypoglycemia between the concomitant use of sulfonylureas with warfarin and the use of sulfonylureas alone in patients with type 2 diabetes. We will use data from the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink spanning from January 1998 to June 2019.

DCM staff believes that an empowering, self-directed and high-quality mentorship will give students the confidence, leadership, and skills needed to create attainable goals, complete their education, and work towards their dreams and aspirations. The enhanced opportunities for continued education which flow from this process encourage DCM students to continue their schooling through post-secondary and/or diploma and certificate training.   

DCM has developed an innovative form of online mentorship in an effort to provide northern youth with access to a diverse group of enthusiastic and qualified mentors, regardless of their geographical location. Through minimal cost of maintaining a website, DCM has provided a unique opportunity for northern youth to interact with mentors through a secure online environment, connecting them with career professionals they would not have the chance to communicate with otherwise, especially for those students living in rural communities. Mentors are specifically identified so that their occupation matches the 'dream-career' of the students. Once matched, students and their assigned mentors communicate entirely through our secure website, following a tailored curriculum for 4 months each fall and/or spring. DCM staff monitor all postings for the safety of both the student and mentor. 

DCM will work in collaboration with our affiliations and networks to promote health-related career mentorships and opportunities to participating students in Yukon and Nunavut schools. With funding from CIHR, we plan to promote this program and actively recruit high-quality mentors."

Dietary guidelines around world advocate the consumption of dairy products as part of a healthy diet. Indeed, there is a substantial body of evidence reporting that milk consumption is inversely associated with the risk of hypertension, that cheese consumption is inversely associated with the risk of stroke, and that yogurt consumption is associated with a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes. However, biological mechanisms underlying the health effects of dairy products remain unknown.

The objective of this research project is to identify mechanisms through which the consumption of different types of dairy products influences cardiovascular disease risk. This study will build on recent advances in nutritional biochemistry that allow to measure a broad spectrum of small molecules in the blood reflecting different biological mechanisms.

In the study, metabolite profiling will be conducted among 7,000 subjects from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professional Follow-up Study who have been followed for more than 30 years. The association between dairy products consumption and blood concentrations of metabolites will be evaluated to identify the metabolic signature of dairy products as well as the cardioprotective mechanisms induced by the consumption of these foods. 

This study will represent the most comprehensive assessment of the metabolic pathways responsible of the cardioprotective effects of dairy products. The study will provide strong evidence to support public health recommendations and the place of dairy products in dietary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Finally, this study represents one of the most extensive application of systems epidemiology in nutrition where traditional epidemiologic methods are coupled with modern technologies in order to identify biological mechanisms underlying the health effects of diet."

Evidence suggests vaccine-related stories often present anti-vaccine views in compelling ways, but little is known about how to optimally counter such negative messages. This study will use qualitative (interviews, digital ethnography, focus groups discussion) and quantitative (survey) methods to develop and pilot test an online intervention to address vaccine hesitancy by promoting positive stories about vaccination."
Hésitation à la vaccination : Comprendre pour mieux agir,"['Dubé, Eve']",['N/A'],"['Anthropologie De La Santé', ""Développement Et Évaluation D'Interventions"", 'Hésitation À La Vaccination', 'Méthodes Qualitatives', 'Recherche Participative Avec Les Communautés']",174260.0,454092,"La vaccination est une mesure de santé publique très efficace pour prévenir des maladies. Toutefois, de plus en plus de personnes ont des craintes et doutes importants par rapport aux vaccins. On estime ainsi qu'une personne sur trois hésiterait à se faire vacciner ou à faire vacciner son enfant. On nomme ce phénomène «hésitation à la vaccination». Les personnes hésitantes peuvent refuser certains vaccins ou retarder la vaccination et ces comportements ont été associés à des éclosions de maladies évitables par la vaccination, comme la rougeole. Cette situation est particulièrement préoccupante dans le contexte de la vaccination contre la COVID-19, car l'hésitation à la vaccination pourrait nuire au succès de la campagne de vaccination.

Ce programme vise donc à mieux comprendre pourquoi des personnes hésitent à se faire vacciner ou à faire vacciner leur(s) enfant(s) ainsi qu'à examiner pourquoi certains professionnels de la santé ont des réticences face à la vaccination. De plus, des travaux seront menés afin de développer et évaluer des solutions pour diminuer les craintes et les doutes par rapport à la vaccination et favoriser des décisions vaccinales informées.

The aim of the present proposal is to develop a comprehensive training program in genetic epidemiology. Key mentors have been identified on the basis of their exceptional experience in research, demonstrated success as mentors, their commitment to training and their leadership in dissemination. The aims of the QGEP training program are 1) to develop a graduate diploma program (Diplome d'Études Suppérieures Spécialisées, DESS) (30 credits) and a microprogram (12-15 credits) in genetic epidemiology at Universite de Montreal with QGEP partnered universities. 2) We will set in place a studentship and fellowship program in genetic epidemiology to promote the development of excellent researchers in genetic epidemiology, capable of trans-disciplinary research activities. And finally, 3) we will establish the North East Workshop in Genetic Epidemiology and Genomic Medicine (NewGem) in collaboration with Harvard University that will be offered in Montreal and Boston in alternating years. The workshop will include focused training sessions lead by highly accomplished mentors with guest-speaker presentations featuring international researchers of outstanding repute with expertise ranging across the spectrum of genetic epidemiology research. Overall, our program will offer unique training opportunities in genetic epidemiology that are expected to increase our capacity to train and retain high-quality graduates in this field."

The study of genetics in large research cohorts offers a powerful approach to help understand the biological causes of disease. Our group has recently developed a bioinformatics tool (ExPheWas) available to the scientific community presenting results of 26,616 protein coding and lincRNA genes with 1746 clinical measures from a large cohort study (the UK Biobank). Here, we will improve on the tool to include sex-sensitive analyses and results. We will study the sex-specific biological factors involved in cognitive function and cardiovascular diseases using methods (Mendelian randomization) that can help in the identification and development of new therapeutic approaches. 

The developed tools and results will be made publicly available and accessible through a user-friendly web interface to promote research on sex differences in genomics. The project will provide valuable results to support sex-aware therapeutic development for cognitive dysfunction and cardiovascular diseases."

More specifically, the research project will study the roles of the social environment and behaviours (diet and physical activity) on weight change in primary school children, taking into consideration birth, infancy, and preschool and primary-school factors. Such research is important because, to date, current weight-reduction and -maintenance interventions at both the individual and population levels have proven to be ineffective. The factors involved in the development of obesity must be considered simultaneously in order to better understand the etiology of this condition, and a gender-based approach is essential to study the situation. As the roots of adult obesity can be traced to childhood, it is thus essential to identify the factors associated with the maintenance of a healthy weight and with the development of overweight and obesity in boys and girls in childhood. The 3 primary objectives of this project are: (1) To study the process of weight change in a population of primary school children (aged 5 to 12 years); (2) to identify the main factors in the social environment and among behaviours (diet, physical activity) that contribute to the maintenance of a healthy weight and the development of overweight and obesity; and, (3) to analyze interactions between the social environment and behaviours in relation to different weight trajectories for boys and girls. Analyses will be done on a large birth cohort of singletons, the Québec Longitudinal Study of Child Development.

These are important questions since 26% of Canadian children are overweight or obese and since many children frequently do not meet government recommended nutritional guidelines. Also, past research has shown that food advertising aimed at children directly affects children's food preferences and eating. This topic becomes even more significant when one considers that 94% of Canadian children have online access at home, that marketing messages are usually found on children's websites, and that online marketing has quadrupled in the past 5 years. 

A total of 1600 children from grades 3 to 6 will complete media diaries in which they will indicate their daily Internet use at 15 minute intervals including the Internet site they were viewing. The 160 most popular web sites will then be analyzed. Children will also complete a questionnaire with the help of their parent in order to measure age, grade level, usual food intake, physical activity levels and usual media use. The weight and height of each child will be measured. Parents of subjects will complete a short questionnaire to determine the child's first language, the education level of parents, and the child's media access in the home.

This research project will inform policy in Canada with regards to regulating food and beverage marketing directed at children on the Internet. Resulting policies may influence the food intake and obesity rates of Canadian children."

L'insomnie peut engendrer de graves problèmes de santé à long terme, puisqu'à court terme, elle affecte le fonctionnement quotidien de ses victimes. Ce trouble du sommeil a des impacts importants dans le milieu du travail, les relations, la vie familiale, le domaine de la santé, etc. À cet égard, l'insomnie est souvent étudiée sur plusieurs composantes, mais une d'entre elles est encore peu exploitée, soit le sommeil paradoxal. Ce stade du sommeil est important, car il est le support principal des rêves. Dans ce projet de recherche, plusieurs facettes du sommeil paradoxal seront examinées chez un groupe de personnes souffrant d'insomnie en comparaison avec un groupe de bons dormeurs. Tout d'abord, le pourcentage de sommeil paradoxal sera comparé entre les deux groupes ainsi que la durée respective de chaque épisode. Ensuite, une analyse des ondes composant ce stade du sommeil sera effectuée. Finalement, des rapports de rêves seront remplis par les participants afin d'établir si la fréquence du rappel des rêves est supérieure chez les personnes souffrant d'insomnie que chez les bons dormeurs. C'est en se penchant sur ce stade du sommeil que nous pourrons approfondir nos connaissances sur l'insomnie. Cela pourrait éventuellement mener à augmenter l'efficacité des traitements déjà offerts ou même contribuer à l'élaboration de nouveaux traitements pour les personnes souffrant d'insomnie."
What They did for Art: How the Industrial Revolution Advanced Art and Destroyed the Artist's Health,"['Duhaime-Ross, Arielle']",['N/A'],"['Art', 'Chemistry', 'Disease', 'Health', 'Industrial Revolution', 'Science History']",30000.0,258784,"During the industrial revolution, there was a rush to capitalize on the new elements being discovered, and the new forms of chemical manipulations that were being introduced. Chemists and artists alike changed the way we look and interact with the world. For example, William Henry Perkin's accidental development of the aniline dye, mauveine, allowed clothes to be permanently dyed mauve for the very first time and changed the fashion industry forever. Another example, is the use of the glow-in-the-dark element, radium, to paint the dials on wristwatches which made clocks decipherable in the dark and in turn fatally poisoned the women painters who moistened the tips of their brushes to increase painting precision. 

This research project will study the inventions and innovations that stimulated artists to create new forms of art from the middle of the nineteenth century to middle of the twentieth century, as well as the health consequences they suffered as a result. Health topics such as lead poisoning experienced by printers, the mercury poisoning affecting Canadian beaver hat-makers, the skin diseases faced by photographers, and the lung diseases contracted by printmakers will be covered. Examples such as these will highlight the sacrifices made in the name of art in Canada at a time when there were no safety guidelines for manipulating toxic chemicals, and no way of identifying or treating the subsequent diseases. 

The resulting feature article will inform the public about the important issues that plagued the artistic community in Canada during the Industrial Revolution, and will help mediate a conversation between health policy-makers and the public about the importance of following guidelines when handling hazardous materials."

Two-spirit, gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and other queer (2SLGBTQ+) individuals also experience adverse health outcomes due to discrimination. 2SLGBTQ+ BIPOC face unique challenges in having their healthcare needs met due to intersecting oppressions. Research is needed to understand these unique health needs but BIPOC may be underrepresented in 2SLGBTQ+ health research due to racism, which few studies have examined. Using an explanatory sequential mixed-methods study design, I aim to investigate if BIPOC are underrepresented in Canadian 2SLGBTQ+ public health research studies and if racism is associated with this underrepresentation. The quantitative arm will be a systematic review and meta-analysis of peer-reviewed and grey literature publications of Canadian 2SLGBTQ+ public health research studies published in English since 2012. The number and proportions of different racial groups will be extracted to calculate the pooled prevalence of BIPOC in these studies, which will be compared to the proportion of 2SLGBTQ+ BIPOC in the 2019 Canadian Community Health Survey. For the qualitative arm, situational analysis will be used to generate a theory on how racism affects participation of BIPOC in Canadian 2SLGBTQ+ public health research studies. Both 2SLGBTQ+ BIPOC and those who conduct studies with this population will be recruited as participants. Data will be collected using in-depth semi-structured interviews. The quantitative findings will be presented to participants in the qualitative arm where they will be asked if underrepresentation is occurring and if so, what are the potential causes. By illuminating how racism oppresses BIPOC in Canadian 2SLGBTQ+ public health research, the findings could be used to propose alternative methods for conducting research with these populations so that they are able to participate willingly and safely in said studies."

It has come to be known for its deteriorating buildings, poorly planned public spaces and its concentration of poverty, violence, drug use, and poor health and educational outcomes. Since 2005, it has been undergoing a complete demolition and reconstruction into a higher-density, mixed income, mixed-land-use community. The proposed research will follow an existing cohort of 132 people (recruited between 2010 and 2013) who have been relocated as part of the redevelopment to assess the impact on their mental health.

Regent Park occupies a 69-acre site just east of the downtown core of Toronto and is home to 7,500 people living in 2,083 social housing units. When the revitalization is complete in several years, the community will have grown from 2,083 households to more than 5,000 households with new parks, stores, services and community facilities. All 2,083 of the rent-geared-to-income units will be replaced, 700 new affordable rental units will be added and there will be more than 3,000 new condominium units.

As buildings are demolished and replaced with new units, households are relocated to social housing units elsewhere. Residents then return to newly constructed housing in the new Regent Park, creating an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the impacts of a population-based housing and neighbourhood intervention on mental health. Currently, almost no quasi-experimental studies have been conducted on housing and health and very little is known about the health benefits of housing improvements. This study will help to fill this gap, with implications for policy in Canada and elsewhere. The proposed research will allow us to achieve maximum value from the data previously collected by following not just the short-term effects of redevelopment on health, but also the medium-term effects."

This research will build on prior work by some members of the research team comparing the relationship between income inequality and health in Canada and the US in 1990/91. In addition to capturing the effect of changes in the last 25 years, this research will investigate the role of three important factors that may exacerbate or mitigate the effects of inequality on population health, within and between the two countries. These three factors are: 

1)Public service expenditures,
2)Inter-generational social mobility (i.e., the likelihood of children moving up or down the social ladder from where their parents were), and
3)Housing affordability

First, they often experience social and vocational problems, because they do not have the minimal skills to find stable, living wage jobs. Second, many develop poor health habits, and mental and physical health problems. These two forms of hardship feed one another in a negative feedback loop: unstable employment is often synonymous with poverty and chaotic schedules, which in turn fuel health problems (e.g. depression) incompatible with work and productivity. Such negative cycles are further reinforced because after exiting high school, many vulnerable youth are ""lost in transition"" between juvenile and adult services, as they age out of school, child welfare and/or pediatric services that often had supported them for years.

Stopping these cycles before the underlying problems become chronic requires concerted approaches addressing low-educated youth's dual educational and health needs. These youth need to be healthy enough to successfully reconnect with education, and they need to become educated enough to have the means to support their own health. Unfortunately, integrated initiatives are very challenging to develop and implement because of the lack of coordination between the educational and health sectors, including in research. The goal of this planning project is to create new links between researchers in education and health interested in improving the outcomes of vulnerable young adults, but who have so far largely operated within the boundaries of their discipline. By the end of the project, we hope to develop a common understanding of the overall needs of vulnerable low-educated youths, of the gaps between those needs and current educational and health services, and potential ways to bridge such gaps.

Mathematical models of infectious disease outbreaks play a key role in assessing risk and planning interventions, and are most effective when combined with statistical inference, allowing predictions to be associated with levels of uncertainty.

Mathematical models were influential in shaping and evaluating the response to the recent West Africa Ebola epidemic, but there was difficulty in obtaining consensus about interpreting their results, and in evaluating how well models performed in predicting the epidemic under different response scenarios.

The proposed research will develop and test robust, easy-to-use methods to fit models to outbreak data. We will develop models that allow us to combine information from, and uncertainty in, multiple sources of information, and validate by testing them against a wide range of simulated scenarios. We will then apply them to data to see both what we can learn retrospectively about the West African Ebola outbreak; and what predictions the framework would have made in real time during the epidemic.

We will start with existing, open-source approaches that fit models to disease data, and extend them to allow combining more types of information and sources of uncertainty. We will explore extensions that consider: geographical differences; occupation, particularly considering health care workers; age; and gender.

This research will provide new insight into the West African Ebola outbreak, and into the biological and behavioural factors that underlie Ebola spread. It will provide insight into what factors curtailed the epidemic, and what interventions were effective. We will construct model tools aimed specifically at allowing policy-makers to investigate decisions under uncertainty, and share them as open-source software packages, providing tools which can be used to assess future outbreaks and plan effective interventions."
The Policy Intersection of Work and Public Health: Paid Sick Leave as a way to Strengthen Evidence-Informed Decision-Making to Improve Health Equity and Population Health,"['Dutt, Monika']",['N/A'],"['Health Equity', 'Health Promotion And Disease Prevention', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Population Health Intervention Research', 'Psychosocial, Sociocultural And Behavioral Determinant']",150000.0,495615,"The importance of a strong public health sector has been made clear throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health is a field that aims to improve the health of populations in many ways. In addition to managing outbreaks, public health is increasingly focusing on determinants of health, such as work conditions, income, and immigration status, as well as structural factors such as racism and colonialism. However, during the pandemic, many public health measures required individual actions without the system level changes needed to support those actions. 

As the pandemic progressed, it became clear that some public health measures were not as effective as they could have been because of long-standing social and economic inequities. Unfortunately, there was - and still is - little evidence to guide policy-makers on ways to enact social and economic policies that would decrease the risk of Covid-19 transmission. This absence contributed to many being unable to follow measures that put the burden of responsibility on the individual. For example, workers who were income-deprived and/or lacked immigration status were at far higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection and yet had fewer supports to adhere to public health requirements.

New approaches where public health makes evidence-informed recommendations on social and economic policies, particularly related to the health of precarious workers, are key to improving the health of both precarious workers as well as all residents in Canada.

The objective of this research is to examine perspectives of precarious workers and public health physicians related to the necessity and feasibility of paid sick days as a public health measure. By understanding how public health can more effectively influence policies through working in solidarity with community labour justice organizers, there will be an anticipated impact of stronger partnerships, improved public health policies, and ultimately, better population health."

There are different contexts in which Canadian teens get pregnant, with some teens intentionally choosing to get pregnant. This sub-group of teenage pregnancy has not been well studied and may require public health interventions specifically targeted to their needs. In this study I will explore the contextual influences (social, historical, cultural, economic, religious) of three distinct Canadian sub-populations of young mothers who chose to get pregnant as a late teen. The project will involve interviews, archival documents, field notes, and the use of arts-based material. By learning about the experiences and contextual influences of Canadian teen girls who intentionally chose pregnancy, this study will be able to guide teen pregnancy-related public health strategies and programs."
Reproductive Politics: Historical Perspectives on Contraceptive Subjects in English Canada since the 1970s,"['Dyck, Erika E']","['Lux, Maureen K']","['Abortion', 'Age', 'Birth Control', 'Disability', 'Gender', 'History', 'Public Policy', 'Qualitative Research', 'Race', 'Reproduction']",103251.0,291625,"In 1969 Prime Minister Pierre Elliot Trudeau flippantly remarked that, 'the state has no business in the bedrooms of the nation,' as he introduced landmark legislation that decriminalized contraception, abortion and homosexuality.  Since then, however, the state has remained in the bedrooms of some Canadians and attempted to creep back into others, in particular, by revisiting laws on abortion and reproductive autonomy.  A closer look at the realities of reproductive rights since the 1970s reveals a much more complicated picture of modern reproductive health and family planning than one celebrated as simply a new era for modern reproduction, freed from state surveillance. 
We will conduct an historical examination of reproductive politics in Canada.  While the common interpretation of this period offers a narrative of liberation with feminists campaigning for greater access to reproductive technologies, that interpretation captures only one aspect of the relationship between the state and family planning. Far from simply creating a new marketplace for reproductive services, the changes beginning in the 1970s altered the culture of reproductive politics in Canada by re-politicizing family planning within a framework of middle-class, healthy, and heteronormative values; our project aims to unpack that interpretation by tracing alternative experiences and producing a more complicated analysis. To do so, we are considering four case studies:  Aboriginal women; women and men with intellectual and physical disabilities; teenage girls; and men seeking vasectomies.  By bringing together and comparing these various categories we will produce a more comprehensive history of reproductive politics in this era."

New HIV and syphilis infections in Saskatchewan occur at more than twice the national average for more than 5 years. As a community-based research partnership between people who use drugs, service providers, and interdisciplinary researchers, this project is informed by principles of syndemics (concurrent epidemics) and implementation science. A rapid assessment and response system will utilize reportneedles.ca, a real-time geographic information system (GIS), to generate geo maps of hotspots where community needle prevalence in public spaces is the highest in Regina, and compare these hotspots to service access. From August 2021 to August 2023, 34,358 discarded needles have been retrieved from 466 public reports on the reportneedles.ca app. We will deploy and evaluate pop-up interventions consisting of: point-of-care HIV and syphilis testing, distribution of HIV self-testing kits, education on pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP and PEP), and training and distribution of Naloxone. Our community-academic partnership permits a pragmatic trial design whereby community needle prevalence, HIV and syphilis epidemiology, and overdose death rates will be compared between a 2-year period of the needle prevalence app without pop-up intervention and a 2-year period of the app alongside pop-up intervention. Additional data from mixed-method research comprised of analyses of variance on mean differences pre- and post-intervention using validated scales as well as semi-structured interviews with pop-up intervention participants will further evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and change in knowledge of this approach. This presentation will detail the methodology and how we launched this community-based research endeavour, which could be a feasible, pragmatic approach to target public health interventions to local areas of highest need."

Although there is no specific drug therapy that can reverse the brain impairment, group therapies may help people aging with HIV and cognitive challenges to better cope with their symptoms when combined with their usual medical treatment and follow-up. This community-based study will involve peer-led focus groups to discuss cognitive remediation group therapy (CRGT) - a combination of mindfulness-based stress reduction and brain training activities tested in a pilot randomized, controlled trial (RCT) - as an in-person intervention for people aging with HIV in 2019. Focus groups (n=~30) in Ontario and Saskatchewan will principally address how the intervention could be adapted in an online or hybrid form considering the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Data and team development will contribute to a CIHR Project or Operating Grant application for an adequately powered RCT to test the efficacy of CRGT. To achieve this grant's objectives of creating a CRGT adaptation plan and forming the team for a larger proposal, we have convened a community-based team comprised of people aging with HIV, organizational decision-makers, frontline clinicians, and researchers. We plan to engage additional peers aging with HIV and organizational representatives who could offer adaptation insight and potentially host the larger RCT. Through the conduct of this project, the potential is high for a thoughtful, community-led adaptation of CRGT to emerge. Given the aging of the HIV population in Canada, increasing support will be required in addition to medical care to improve quality of life, and proactively address concerns about cognition."

A Public Health Surveillance System of Mental-Ill Health among Young People in Canada,"['Edwards, Jordan']",['N/A'],"['Anxiety', 'Bayesian', 'Data Linkage', 'Depression', 'Health Administrative Data', 'Mental Health Surveillance', 'Population-Level Estimates', 'Prevalence/Incidence', 'Survey Data', 'Youth Mental Health']",90000.0,440757,"Mental illness is the largest contributor to adolescent disability worldwide. Over the past decade, there have been increases in mental illness among adolescents and young adults aged 12 to 25, which have disproportionately impacted females. Despite these alarming trends, Canada lacks a coordinated and systematic approach for monitoring mental illness in youth at a national level. As such, we plan on filling this urgent need by developing a national public health surveillance system of mental-ill health among youth in Canada, which systematically collects, analyzes, and reports data on mental-ill health among youth. This system will provide more accurate and representative estimates of mental illness among youth by using all available data sources across Canada. Furthermore, it will provide the opportunity to compare and contrast estimates of mental illness in youth across time, space, and population sub-groups, including differences by sex, gender, race/ethnicity, and poverty. The goal of this work is to inform policy makers of trends in mental illness in youth using the best possible evidence available in Canada. The objectives of this fellowship are to fill current evidence gaps required to inform the development of a surveillance system. This will include collecting available evidence on mental illness in youth across Canada and testing and evaluating the quality of various common measures of mental health in youth. Furthermore, we will begin developing a model to estimate the prevalence of mental illness using information from multiple data sources simultaneously. There is an urgent need to develop the infrastructure required to monitor trends in mental illness among young people in our country. By leveraging existing Canadian data, our goal is to establish the necessary pre-requisites for a public health surveillance system of mental ill-health among young people in Canada that can inform equitable mental health policy."

Often referred to as 'psychedelic-assisted therapies', there has been a re-emergence in the past 15 years of clinical trials exploring the potential of substances such as psilocybin, MDMA, and ketamine in end of life care and in the treatment of mental health (i.e, depression, anxiety, PTSD) and substance use disorders. However, inclusion criteria for clinical trials often limit the size and diversity of study participants, and thus cannot always accurately portray the effectiveness of interventions for the general population. Given the potential therapeutic benefits of psychedelic-assisted therapies, it is important to explore both the benefit and risks of these substances for the general population and for population groups under-represented in clinical trials, including visible minorities and gender diverse groups. The aim of this research is to explore population health research approaches to understand the potential benefits, harms, and equitable allocation of psychedelic-assisted therapies for the Canadian population. The application of public health surveillance systems and resource allocation will be investigated with diverse stakeholders, including researchers, public health stakeholders at the provincial/territorial and federal level, and people with lived and living experience. Research findings will be used to increase the understanding of the population health outcomes for increasing use of psychedelic substances, and inform public policy and programs to target potential benefits to the most at need populations."
Fostering Dialogue Across Care Worker and 2SLGBTQI Older Adult Divides: An Arts-Based Action Research Project,"['Egale Canada, .']","['Jakubiec, Brittany A', 'Pang, Celeste']","['2slgbtqi', 'Aging', 'Care Work', 'Health Equity', 'Home Care', 'Long-Term Care']",168996.0,460040,"Two-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer and intersex (2SLGBTQI) older adults face increased barriers to accessing healthcare services. These barriers include Canadian healthcare systems and structures that continue to be geared towards a cis-heteronormative patient population (Daley, 2006; Mule et al., 2009) as well as discrimination and negative care encounters that older 2SLGBTQI people have faced earlier in life (e.g, Brotman et al., 2007).   

Fears of homophobia and transphobia in home care and long-term care and having to ""go back into the closet"" are especially widespread. These are fears documented by researchers for over a decade (e.g., Brotman et al. 2007; Sussman et al., 2018); fears which, significantly, can target care workers who are mostly people of colour and immigrants (Pang, forthcoming). As the COVID-19 pandemic has shown care workers perform ""essential"" work, yet are undervalued, and can experience violence in the workplace (Daly et al., 2011). While they seek to provide person-centered care and to access opportunities to better understand 2SLGBTQI clients' needs, these opportunities are lacking (Daley and MacDonnell, 2015). 

This research study seeks to better understand the key disconnects between 2SLGBTQI older adults and care workers in the personal support work sector, and to identify how these can be bridged through arts-based action research. Arts-based methods are an increasingly popular research approach (Luttrell & Chalfen, 2010; Mitchell, De Lange, & Moletsane, 2017) where art plays a primary role in knowledge co-creation and is a source of data representation (Kunt, 2020). An arts-based method will allow researchers to explore sensitive and possibly controversial topics and issues sometimes difficult to articulate using words alone (Dew, Smith, Collings, & Savage, 2018), ideal for this research that centrally seeks to create space for dialogue, bridge gaps, and improve access to care."

Over 60% of adult Canadians have used at least one prescription drug in the past 6 months, and six or more drugs are taken by 18% of the older population. While there are considerable benefits from modern drug therapy, the frequent occurrence of adverse drug-related events and the uncertainty about effects of drugs after they enter the market have highlighted fundamental shortcomings in the ability to actively monitor drugs after their approval. 
Electronic health records, computerized prescribing and automated patient follow-up systems are health information technologies that are being increasingly used to improve the quality of care around the world. These new health information technologies provide an unprecedented opportunity to develop an active surveillance system that will monitor and provide patients and physicians with real-time feedback on the comparative safety and effectiveness of new drugs. 
Conducting active surveillance on a collaborative international scale will provide more rapid information about drug safety and effectiveness from users around the world as well as permit more personalized risk/benefit analysis for subgroups where drugs may have a different risk/benefit profile.
The purpose of this project is to develop state-of-the-art methods of i) monitoring, and  ii) analyzing the comparative risk and benefit of new drug therapies, in real-time, through an international prospective surveillance system."

2.What impact will legalization of recreational cannabis use have on specific and potentially vulnerable sub-groups of the population?
3.How have other countries regulated recreational cannabis use, and how do different regulatory strategies influence use and mitigate potentially adverse outcomes?

Across North America, increases in vaping have exceeded all other documented changes in substance use behaviours among youth in the past four decades. The potentially harmful consequences of youth e-cigarette use have been cited by many organizations (American Academy of Pediatrics, Canadian Cancer Society, Canadian Paediatric Society) and include downstream smoking behaviour, nicotine dependence, and disrupted brain development and lung function. These concerns have intensified amidst a recent surge in e-cigarette popularity among younger individuals, particularly associated with the entry into the market of high nicotine content devices which appeal to youth (e.g., JUUL). Despite the public health community's long-term gains in reducing youth tobacco use, Big Tobacco (which has shares in most large e-cigarette companies) is now using regulatory loopholes to create and market vaping products to addict a new generation of youth to nicotine. Effective interventions, regulations, and public health approaches are urgently needed to address this critical public health issue.

We will conduct two systematic reviews and one scoping review concerning strategies to prevent use and reduce harms associated with youth e-cigarette use. We will perform database and grey literature searches with pre-defined search strategies and inclusion criteria for each review. Using an integrated knowledge translation approach, we have assembled an experienced research team with substantial clinical, methodological, library science, knowledge translation, and public health expertise.

Existing Canadian data can be used to address these knowledge gaps. 

This project will make use of routinely collected hospital, administrative and public health data in Ontario to investigate the long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infections in pregnancy on child health and development. We will establish a large dataset of mother and infant pairs with and without documented COVID-19 in pregnancy. Within this dataset, we will investigate the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy and child risk of hospitalization, emergency department visits, and infection-related health care use. We will also assess the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy and child risk of hearing and sight deficits, speech and language delays, and neurodevelopmental disorders. In our analyses, we will account for the timing of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy, disease severity, presence of symptoms, postnatal infections, and maternal and child vaccinations. 

With this approach, we will have the breadth and depth of detail necessary to address critical questions about the impacts of COVID-19 on fetal development and child wellbeing and the protective role of COVID-19 vaccines for reducing risk of adverse health outcomes. We will use our findings to help inform maternity and child health care providers, health agencies and Canadian families about the potential long-term risks associated with COVID-19 in pregnancy, and support early screening and intervention of at-risk children to give them the best possible starts in life."

     Our research addresses this knowledge gap by examining socioeconomic differences in adolescent health in 43 countries. We will examine how socioeconomic differences in health are shaped by economic, political and social contexts. Our focus is on health behaviours and emotional, physical and social health problems that contribute to chronic disease through the lifespan.
     Through our involvement in the WHO-Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study, our research will explore international differences and nested environmental influences on the health of over 1 million adolescents who were surveyed between 1994 and 2014. Our goal is to identify social influences that narrow social class differences in adolescent health, focusing on family, peer and school supports. We also want to identify policies that help close the gap in adolescent health through the dynamic interplay of nested social contexts.
     Ultimately, our goal is to create evidence-based policy recommendations on ways to promote health equality in youths. Our research addresses the need to better understand how health is shaped and constrained by the settings in which we live and grow."

Our research examines the contribution of parental depression and alcohol misuse to the onset of emotional, behavioral and 
social problems in their children. We will use data that were collected from a cohort of parents and children in the National 
Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY). 

Our research will address three research questions: 
1. Do parental depression and alcohol misuse have added or interactive effects on the onset of child outcome? In other 
words, does the co-existence (or ""comorbidity) of these problems in parents have a greater impact on children's mental 
health than would be predicted by each problem alone?
2. Are these effects consistent from early childhood to late adolescence?
3. Are these effects explained by changes to the child's social environment (e.g., parent-child hostility, poor parental 
monitoring, or family dysfunction)?  

Our research will also explore developmental changes these mediators across stages of child development. An accelerated 
longitudinal design will enable us to follow a cross-section of age groups over a period of 12 years in a way that allows us to 
study change from ages 4 to 23. 

This research will give us a better understanding the how mental illness and alcohol problems are passed down from 
parents to children. Our findings will enhance treatment interventions and community-based policies and programs that

The REM provides an unprecedented opportunity to study a major public transport investment in the Canadian context and monitor the project impacts before, during, and after the construction. Research objectives include measuring changes in travel behaviour, physical activity levels, health outcomes, and housing affordability using mixed methods. The lessons of this research are particularly timely as federal and provincial governments across Canada are pledging to support similar projects as part of their efforts to combat climate change, improve access to health-promoting amenities, and address disparities in mobility among Canadians. This study builds on the success of a Collaborative Health Research Project (CHRP), which is currently conducted by the same research team and funded by CIHR and NSERC to collect behavioural and health outcomes from our panel of nearly 9000 individuals. To our knowledge, no comprehensive longitudinal study has been planned or conducted to fully assess the REM's possibly profound impacts on travel behaviour and public health before, during, and after the construction. This research will shed light on the impacts of large public investments in terms of gender, socio-economic status, age, and other social considerations, while providing recommendations to help improve equity and quality-of-life outcomes.

The social information processing response to intranasal oxytocin as a potential marker of social vulnerability and risk for depression,"['Ellenbogen, Mark A']","['Harkness, Kate L', 'Johnson, Aaron P']","['Depression', 'Eye Tracking', 'Inhibition', 'Interpersonal Functioning', 'Neuropeptides', 'Oxytocin', 'Social Cognition', 'Theory Of Mind']",276713.0,305916,"Interpersonal functioning is integral to mental and physical health. Research on the biopsychosocial basis of affiliation offers important insight into the pathophysiology of mental disorders associated with social dysfunction, such as major depression. One neuropeptide (small protein-like molecules used by brain neurons to communicate with each other), oxytocin, is widely believed to have a central role in promoting affiliative behavior. However, recent studies in humans, using a nasal spray administration, have reported mixed findings with respect to the purported positive social effects of oxytocin. We propose that the response to the administration of an oxytocin nasal spray can be used to assess for abnormalities in the oxytocin system in persons at risk for depression. More specifically, we will attempt, for the first time, to link oxytocin-induced changes in how people perceive and interpret emotional pictures to future changes in their interpersonal relations and clinical symptoms. The study will track social behavior in previously-depressed and never-depressed healthy young adults for 18 months, and will assess whether the cognitive response to oxytocin can predict interpersonal difficulties and symptoms of depression six to 18 months later. The proposed research is important because it is the first study to explicitly assess the clinical relevance of studying challenges to this important neurobiological system. It represents a novel approach to studying interpersonal vulnerability, and has important implications for understanding depression. If the response to an oxytocin challenge signifies vulnerability for interpersonal problems and depression, the procedure could be used in the context of identifying people who would benefit from preventative interventions."

New developments in the measurement of wellbeing - led by Canadians for Canadians - has changed this landscape.  The Canadian Index of Wellbeing (located at the University of Waterloo) delivers a broader depth of understanding that, when partnered with GDP, gives citizens and decision-makers the full package of information they need to plan for a healthy, sustainable future.  

The objective of this Café Scientifique is for expert health researchers to share how the wellbeing of Canadians is tracked and measured using the CIW to ensure better health and quality of life, with Canadians from all sectors of society. Audience members will have the opportunity to contribute their views on current research and future directions. The Café Scientifique will be open to members of the general public who have an interest in health and well-being and the importance of the links between economic and other aspects of population health. This topic is of tremendous interest among general publics - influenced by substantial recent media coverage around a range of indices related to: happiness, wellbeing, health, quality of life, and the relationships between them.

An audience member email distribution list will be developed as a result of the Café. The list will form the basis of a communication strategy between the researchers and audience members, including a report of the Café, and notifications of similar upcoming community-based events and participatory research opportunities. This strategy will encourage audience member and health researcher engagement and communication, and knowledge sharing opportunities into the future.  The vision is to establish an engaged citizenry that will help us measure, monitor and enhance the long-term health and well-being of the Canadian population."

The Sandbox Project was created to respond to the state of children's health in Canada.  The project vision is to make Canada the healthiest place on earth for children and youth to grow and thrive. This project has three components: knowledge synthesis, knowledge dissemination, and knowledge mobilization.
As part of the knowledge synthesis component, proposed activities include: 1) a national environmental scan of the level and scope of evidence for the relationship between the environment and children's health; and 2) an international environmental scan of relevant policies being implemented to support this goal. As part of the knowledge dissemination component, the project investigators will engage a knowledge broker to translate the technical reports into policy briefs on the state of children's environmental health, both nationally and internationally. The objective of the knowledge mobilization component is to bring together, at a one-day meeting, members of the Environmental Health Working Group and end users of knowledge (receptor groups) to share this knowledge to develop a long-term research agenda for Canada.  The Environmental Health Working Group will facilitate the meeting to share policy briefs and to engage key stakeholders in developing a work plan for the Working Group for 2012-2016.

The four key objectives are: to evaluate the intended and unintended impacts (both positive and negative) of cannabis policies in Ontario on the following cannabis policy outcomes: (1) Consumption of cannabis (patterns and cannabis use disorder) and other psychoactive substances, cannabis related harm to others, and impacts on mental health; (2) Impact on the health care and treatment systems;  (3) Cannabis-impaired driving and injuries; (4) Understand how policy implementation may mitigate the negative consequences or enhance the positive consequences of cannabis use. Each objective will examine subgroup differences, including a sex/gender analysis.
Our objectives have been derived in close collaboration with our decision makers from the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care. Leveraging existing provincial resources with additional new sources of data, our team will comprehensively assess cannabis policy impacts based on the 10 core indicators of public health impact of cannabis 5 previously identified (Fischer et al., 2018) supplemented by additional indicators identified by key stakeholders. Our findings will be disseminated using open science practices. We will work closely with the Health Canada funded Champions Circle for Cannabis Knowledge Exchange Hub to ensure that the findings are disseminated to key stakeholders across the province."

People Who Use Drugs (PWUD) have intersecting health and social vulnerabilities that elevate their risk for COVID-19 infection, complications and mortality. It is therefore critical that PWUD are vaccinated to reduce their risks. However, research has suggested that vaccine acceptability ratings are lower than the general population (Iverson et al., 2021) with safety concerns being the most common reason for vaccine hesitancy (Dietze et al., 2021).
Objectives:
The purpose of this study is to: (1) identify drivers of vaccine hesitancy and approaches to improve vaccine confidence and; (2) to develop national tailored knowledge mobilization and translation products that are for and by PWUD to promote vaccination based on the findings from Objective 1. We will work closely with PWUD and service providers who work with this population to develop these materials.
Methods:
The study will recruit 100 participants from an existing national sample of PWUD who previously participated in telephone/video interviews about the impact of COVID-19 in May-June 2020. Semi-structured interviews will be used to identify barriers to receiving vaccinations and ways to address barriers. An advisory committee of PWUD, service providers working with PWUD, and the research team will use responses from the interviews to co-create a multi-pronged approach to address vaccine hesitancy among PWUD. The strategy will include the following components: (1) Developing and disseminating vaccine information resources for PWUD; and (2) Providing training tools to service providers working with PWUD to improve conversations about vaccinations."

In Canada, households with children are more likely to experience food insecurity, and school food programs that are universally available to all children can support the development of healthy eating patterns across groups of varying socioeconomic status. There is a significant gap in rigourous community-engaged academic research on the impact of school meal programs, especially universal ones. The purpose of this population health intervention research is to study the impacts of a two-year universal, curriculum-integrated healthy school lunch program in elementary schools in Saskatoon on food consumption, dietary quality and food and nutrition-related knowledge, attitudes and practices. This study will take place in two intervention elementary schools matched with two control schools.

However, despite the disproportionate burden of HIV amongst WLWH and the evident gender disparities, there remains a substantial evidence gap on the health impacts of incarceration among WLWH. With the current shift in leadership for the provision of healthcare within BC's provincial correctional centres, this research will evaluate and explore the impact of incarceration on HIV health outcomes for WLWH throughout the transition. The research will draw on empirical survey data gathered from a larger longitudinal cohort study of WLWH in Vancouver, and will employ advanced epidemiology modelling techniques to make use of longitudinal data and examine the relationship between incarceration and HIV health outcomes for WLWH. This work will be complimented by in-depth interviews with WLWH who have recently been incarcerated as well as peer mentors and service providers within the correctional healthcare system. Given the high rates of HIV among incarcerated women in Canada as well as globally, there is a critical need to translate these findings into health policy and practice.

The Impact of Drug Exposure Misclassification on Study Estimates of Clinical Outcomes in Administrative Drug Databases,"['Eurich, Dean']","['Johnson, Jeffrey A', 'Mcalister, Finlay A', 'Simpson, Scot H']","['Health Outcomes', 'Pharmacotherapy', 'Policy', 'Population Health']",143425.0,238108,"All provincial governments collect information on drugs reimbursed through the provincial drug insurance plan. There is increasing use of this data to study the safety and effectiveness of drugs. These studies rely on accurate drug data in the databases in order to provide meaningful results. Most provinces only collect drug information if the drug is partially or fully covered under the provincial drug insurance plan. These drug policies that limit the insurance coverage of drugs affect not only patients but also researchers who use provincial prescription databases to study drug effects.  

We aim to study the effects of specific drug policies which affect a number of drugs used by Canadians including those to treat diabetes, heart disease, and stomach disorders.  All of these drugs are subject to a specific type of drug policy, which requires people to meet specific criteria before the drug will be covered by the insurance plan.  Many people do not meet these ""criteria"" and have to rely on private insurance or ""pay out of pocket"" to acquire the drug.  As a result, since the provincial insurance plan is not paying for the drug, most do not record the use of the drug within their insurance databases.  This creates inaccurate drug information and may cause results from studies to be misleading.  

In Saskatchewan, two databases exist - one that records all drugs used in the province and a second database that only collects drugs that are covered by the insurance plan. As a result, using these databases (the insurance databases vs the complete databases), we will test whether the missing information in the provincial drug insurance databases has the potential to altered and mislead study results.  

This study will inform those who conduct drug research studies using provincial health care databases of the impact of specific drug coverage policies on the accuracy of their study results."
Reorganizing the Approach to Diabetes through the Application of Registries (RADAR),"['Eurich, Dean', 'Johnson, Jeffrey A', 'Majumdar, Sumit R']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal', 'Diabetes', 'Health Care Delivery', 'Innovative Systems', 'Quality Improvement']",717750.0,334605,"First Nation (FN) seniors are high risk for diabetes morbidity/mortality and this is compounded by suboptimal care in isolated FN communities. Limited community nursing capacity and a lack of electronic registries/records leads to a reactive, disorganized approach to care. This situation is directly responsible for the poor diabetes related outcomes observed in FN seniors. Health Canada's 2010-2015 Aboriginal Diabetes Initiative calls for innovative, culturally relevant approaches aimed at increasing community wellness and reducing the burden of diabetes through the use of local knowledge. The Canadian Diabetes Association specifically mentions the importance of using systems to identify diabetics and have a systematic follow-up process. 

The RADAR study fits exactly with these priorities by using health technology information systems and a centralized care coordinator to strengthen FN community capacity. RADAR will establish system-wide, scalable infrastructure (an integrated diabetes registry/records system) that will support front-line community nurses in transforming care for FN seniors with diabetes. 

The proposed model has two major components to improve the care of FN senior diabetics: 1) Implementation of a common diabetes registry and health records system (eHIPP technology); 2) Care coordinator to support front-line providers for measurement, monitoring and streamlined, coordinated referral and follow-up with use of the technology. 

We hypothesize that the RADAR model will result in an overall improvement in the quality of clinical care of FN seniors living with diabetes on reserve. We also hypothesize that the RADAR model will be effective, efficient and transferable at the organizational level within these communities and will have a broader public health impact on the population of those with diabetes. Importantly, all outcomes will be assessed from the lens of the FN communities to ensure model is culturally appropriate from their perspective."
Studying the Impact of Legal Cannabis Access on Use of Opiate Prescriptions in Patients with Chronic Pain: Cross Jurisdictional Analysis,"['Eurich, Dean']","['Dyck, Jason R', 'Hanlon, John G', 'Hyshka, Elaine']","['Cannabis', 'Health Outcomes', 'Hospitalizations']",,392319,"Although legal access to medical cannabis has been available in Canada for many years, our society has yet to fully understand the important health impacts surrounding the use of medical cannabis.

The urgency of obtaining this information is emphasized by the proposal to legalize cannabis in Canada and the subsequent projected increase in cannabis users to as high as 7 million by 2021. Thus, without understanding the risks or benefits of cannabis consumption for such a large number of Canadians, we will not know the range of potential health outcomes of these individuals until too late. As a result, researchers must initiate immediate strategies to understand the benefits and risks associated with cannabis use in a real-world context. 

One area where cannabis is expected to have some potential impact relates to pain management. The use of narcotics in Canada has reached epidemic proportions with disastrous outcomes on society. Medical cannabis may allow people who are using narcotics chronically for pain to either reduce their use or stop all together. However, the evidence to support medical cannabis in this role is currently lacking.

To assist with this, our team of experts will expand their work with one of the largest known databases of patients seeking cannabis as a medical therapy in order to understand the benefits and the risks associated with cannabis use in patients already receiving narcotics on a chronic basis. We will use this information to determine if medical cannabis influences either the amount of narcotics used by patients or if it can also assist in allowing patients to stop using narcotics. This information has the potential to have a substantial impact on the overall health of Canadians using cannabis and narcotics."

One idea is to grow human cells in a dish, expose them to chemicals, measure detailed biological data, and predict whether real-life concentrations of that chemical could be toxic in humans. However, it is difficult to translate impacts in isolated cells to impacts in complex organisms and while these new methods do work to some extent, each fails to capture many toxicity outcomes for many chemicals. My goal is to determine if this problem can be solved by growing the cells more like real organs, or by collecting more diverse data. One data type that seems promising is image-based profiling, where pictures taken with high-powered microscopes are analyzed to quantify the size, shape, and texture of components inside of thousands of individual cells. I will analyze imaging data from increasingly complex cell models exposed to compounds known to cause liver toxicity to determine which toxicity outcomes are detected in basic cell models versus co-cultures (where two or more types of cells are grown together; 60 compounds), organoids (where cells are grown in 3D instead of 2D; ~500 compounds), and organ-on-a-chip models (where microfluidics are used to simulate the inside of an organ; ~500 compounds). For a larger group of compounds (~1600), I will analyze image data from the basic cell models, along with the expression of ~3000 genes and the abundance of ~200 proteins, allowing me to determine how well different data types detect different types of toxicity outcomes. While these questions have long been of interest, the technology is only now becoming mature enough to investigate them at scale. The findings of this research could inform testing methods used around the world for decades to come."

Using this sample, we will investigate whether TDV is predictive of negative effects on health and well-being 5 years after victimization; primary outcome measures will include depression, substance use, suicidal behaviors, unhealthy weight control behaviors and sexual risk behaviors. We will also investigate whether negative effects vary by timing or type of victimization, if effects persist 10 years after victimization, and if any 10-year effects are explained by the experience of re-victimization in young adulthood.  To supplement the Add Health analyses, we will also conduct interviews with teens in New York state, in order to determine when (i.e., under what conditions) TDV victimization is considered most harmful. This will be the first study to investigate long-term outcomes of TDV victimization for males and females in a nationally representative sample, and will provide the most comprehensive data to date on adverse outcomes related to victimization. Results from this research can be used to improve secondary TDV prevention programs (i.e., programs that intervene after the problem has occurred), services that can directly impact the health and well-being of teens."
Integrating Science and Politics for Public Health,"['Fafard, Patrick']","['Clavier, Carole', 'Fierlbeck, Katherine', 'Mcintosh, Thomas A']","['Health Equity', 'Obesity', 'Politics', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Policy']",19995.0,383728,"Many in the public health community continue to work towards the goal where public health policy is based on scientific evidence or at least informed by such evidence. They and others continue to invest in efforts to translate or move such evidence into policy. At the same time, there are continuing concerns about politics or ideology as barriers to achieving this goal. In contrast, there are accounts of public health policy making that simply assert that everything, and in particular health, is intrinsically and profoundly political. On this view, policy choices are all based on political negotiations.  This project is premised on the claim that, we need to move beyond simplistic caricatures of rational scientists battling strategic politicians or claims that scientific evidence is largely irrelevant to the making of public health policy. Instead we need a fulsome account of public health policy that reconciles the role of scientific evidence with the essential political considerations of democratic states. This grant is meant to design a larger research project that will explore conventional and newer mechanisms through which scientific research informs policy. The goal is to be able to develop policy and program responses to pressing public health challenges that are both democratically legitimate and informed by the best available scientific evidence."
Institutional design for an effective chief public health officer: a comparative case study,"['Fafard, Patrick']",['N/A'],"['Chief Public Health Officer', 'Medical Officer Of Health', 'Public Administration', 'Public Health Governance']",18778.0,365802,"In Canada and in many countries around the world there is a senior public health official tasked with the responsibility of overseeing public and population health. In some jurisdictions, the role is styled as the Chief Public Health Officer or CPHO (e.g., Canada; Nova Scotia). In others, the person is called the Chief Medical Officer of Health (e.g., Ontario; Alberta; United Kingdom; Australia). In most Canadian cities and towns, the role is described as the Medical Officer of Health (MOH).  For this project, we use the general term CPHO to cover the range of titles.

The CPHO typically has a mandate to provide advice to the Minister of Health (or to city council) and to the government more generally on a range of issues relating to public and population health. In many cases the role includes responsibility for a suite of public health programs. Often, the CPHO has an advocacy role that typically involves, at minimum, the production of reports.  In some jurisdictions, the CPHO is tightly integrated into the Department of Health (or the equivalent) and has senior management responsibilities for programs. In others, she/he has a more limited advisory or advocacy role. 

To date there has been almost no research on the CPHO role, how it varies and why, and with what effect on public and population health. This project is designed to discover the benefits, costs, risks and trade-offs of different options for structuring CPHO positions in different contexts. The project is designed as a comparative case study with a review of documents, legislative analysis, and interviews. The proposed research is timely since the Government of Canada and the governments of several Caribbean countries are looking to restructure these positions. Much the same is true at the provincial level in Canada as governments move away from regionalized health system and are faced with the question of how best to organize the delivery of public health policies and programs."

The emergence of a novel coronavirus has vividly demonstrated the need for clear, timely, and accessible information from trusted and authoritative public figures. In many countries, the virus has been accompanied by the spread of false information, racism, and panic. These factors heighten the risks of the virus for individuals and communities and complicate the challenges public health leaders face in containing it.  

The proposed research will systematically analyze the ways in which public health leaders in Canada and four other countries with similar public health systems are addressing the biological and social risks of the novel coronavirus in their public messaging across a range of platforms, including social media. Using text analysis of official communications and one-on-one interviews with public health leaders, we will analyze and compare how government spokespeople, including Chief Public Health Officers and Ministers of Health, are communicating medical advice, addressing misinformation, and tackling racism. We will also examine whether and how they identify different impacts of the virus based on sex and gender. The project will additionally collect public polling data to investigate the extent to which these public health communications are received, understood, and trusted by citizens in different countries. As a result of this project, we will have a better understanding of who speaks for the government during an outbreak, the kind of information they share, and how their messages are understood by the public."

One-size-fits-all public health policies (PHPs) do not sufficiently address inequities. It is essential that PHPs be developed and implemented with health equity in mind. As we prepare for a post-pandemic recovery and for future health emergencies, it is important for us to look back and assess how and why PHPs were developed and implemented in Ontario.
In Objective 1 of the study, we will answer ""what happened"" by categorizing all PHPs pertaining to vaccinations and isolation supports in Ontario and querying whether and how they considered health equity.
In Objective 2 of the study, we will determine ""why"" public health policies were developed or implemented using (or not using) a health equity lens.
In Objective 3, we will determine ""what we could have done differently"" by using mathematical models to compare the potential impacts of different PHP combinations.
In Objective 4, we will learn ""what it would take to do things differently"" by asking public health actors to describe the barriers and enablers to developing and implementing PHPs that prioritize the needs of those most at-risk of infection and negative health outcomes.
Our team includes government and public health decision makers from the federal, provincial, and local/regional levels. Our team also includes representatives of health-equity focused organizations, who supported implementation of public health policies at the provincial and local/regional levels."

In our own work, all of the mothers we interviewed reported unwanted thoughts of harm coming to their infant, and half reported unwanted thoughts of harming their infant.  Thoughts of harming one's infant can be very upsetting, and occur even among women who have no history of violence, and who hold a deep desire to protect and care for their infant. As very little research on postpartum thoughts of harm has been conducted, professionals are unsure about how to respond to them. Inappropriate responses can have serious consequences. If the thoughts mean that a woman is at risk of harming her infant, then acting to protect the infant is necessary. However, if the thoughts are a common and normal part of early parenting, taking dramatic steps to protect the child may make the mother feel unnecessarily afraid that she is a threat to her infant.  Among vulnerable women, this may make it more likely that she develop emotional difficulties such as anxiety or depression. The purpose of this research is to learn more about new mothers' unwanted thoughts of infant-related harm: how common these thoughts are, how mothers experience and respond to them, how they relate to maternal mental health, and whether they predict child harm. To find this out, we are recruiting a large, representative sample of pregnant women in British Columbia.  Women will be assessed from late in pregnancy through to 3-months postpartum.  We will assess the occurrence, content, and experience of thoughts of harm as well as how women respond to them.  We will assess their relation to postpartum maternal anxiety and depression, and the possible connection to child harm.  We hope that our research will help new mothers who experience unwanted thoughts of harm related to their infant, and make it easier for care providers to respond appropriately to them."

Addressing these factors and their influence on health outcomes requires an approach to health policy that works across sectors beyond 'health'. The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified differences in social, economic conditions, and illustrates how addressing these differences requires a whole-of-society and whole-of-government response Health in All Policies (HiAP) is one such approach, where different government sectors work together around health.
The Intersectoral Partnerships and Initiatives team (IPI) within the Public Health Agency of Canada(PHAC) is looking to benefit from research about how best to take up key lessons from HiAP into its work. Addressing this challenge will strategically inform IPI's current and future partnerships, and support its efforts to improve the circumstances in which we live, work, grow, and play the most effective ways possible. Using data and evidence available on HIAP, the project will develop evidence-based tools and materials for the Intersectoral Partnerships and Initiatives team to use in facilitating more effective collaboration and more strategic partnerships with non-health sector government departments. The project will also mobilize learnings within government and across sectors; both directly (i.e., through presentations to different public health and allied audiences about the review and its findings), and indirectly (i.e., through adopting and encouraging the use of my findings and tools in my day-to-day work as an HSI fellow and policy analyst on the IPI team)."

Analyzing this data helps determine if the severity of the problem of oral health inequalities has improved, worsened, or remained the same over time. Additionally, this research will help identify vulnerable sub-groups and characteristics in the Canadian population that are at higher risk for poor oral health. Ultimately, these results may help policymakers better understand the severity of the problem, urgency for action, and potential for resolution."

The racism that Black Canadians face also intersects with other causes of poor health related to the social determinants of health (SDOH). Because Black Canadians have poorer health and unequal access to care, they have specific needs that the healthcare system must address. Providing healthcare through community health centres (CHCs) is a solution. CHCs can be beneficial because they are rooted in communities and focus on the SDOH. However, there is little information about how Black service users feel about receiving care from CHCs and whether they successfully address the SDOH, including ABR. This applied research project seeks to understand Black patients' feelings about the healthcare they receive from CHCs and the best ways to incorporate the SDOH into care. The project aims to i) glean the current best practices for addressing ABR and incorporating the SDOH into primary care, ii) explore how ABR and other forms of oppression determine unique access needs for Black service users of CHCs, and iii) develop an actionable model to improve how CHCs address ABR and the SDOH in care. The project will include three phases and will use a qualitative study design. In the first phase, I will conduct a scoping review to see how other countries incorporate the SDOH into care. Then, I will facilitate three focus groups and 18 interviews with stakeholders of CHCs to understand Black patients' healthcare experiences and perceptions of how best to address the SDOH in primary care. During the last phase, I will bring these stakeholders together to develop a strategy CHCs in Ontario can implement. This project is relevant to healthcare systems as it will inform how CHCs can improve healthcare delivery to Black service users related to the SDOH. Findings will also influence social policy, increase access to healthcare and improve health outcomes."

There have been some studies regarding the prevalence of food insecurity in post-secondary students, but little research has examined the food security, financial, psychological and physical health status of the students who use campus food banks.  In addition, there has been little investigation into gender differences with regards to food bank usage.  The study that is being proposed aims to examine the following factors among students who use the University of Alberta Campus Food Bank (CFB):  food security status; financial status; self-perceived mental and physical well-being; perceived effects of nutrition on academic success; and the relationship between gender and the aforementioned factors.  It is hypothesized that students using the CFB will have low food security, low financial status, and poor self-perceived well-being.  This study will elucidate how nutrition affects academics from the students' perspectives and if there is an association between food bank use and gender.  The data in the study will be collected from students who use the CFB, using structured surveys over a 12-month period.  After this period, the results will be analyzed with specific attention to patterns in the members' responses."

Ces conflits de normes engendrent des incertitudes ou des dilemmes pratiques qui sont parfois renvoyés aux éthiciens cliniques ou aux comités de bioéthique. Face aux défis éthiques vécus dans un contexte de prestation de soins, les modèles d'aide à la décision dont disposent actuellement les éthiciens et les cliniciens sont relativement nombreux, mais ils comportent des lacunes évidentes, notamment lorsqu'il s'agit d'aborder des problèmes à plusieurs niveaux (micro, meso et macro). Leur champ d'application est limité par leur incapacité à traiter une variété d'informations et à formaliser le processus de décision. À l'intérieur de ces modèles, la rationalité d'une décision repose trop souvent sur l' « intuition » des acteurs, plutôt que sur une démarche systématique, rigoureuse et facilement reproductible. L'objectif principal de cet atelier est donc de convier plusieurs experts reconnus dans le domaine de la prise de décision éthique afin de tester la limite des modèles existants et de proposer de nouveaux modèles ou des modifications à ceux-ci.

I propose a CDA of: scholarly texts (e.g.: scientific journal articles), media texts (e.g.: advertisement), and texts from interviews with bariatric surgeons. To determine the effects of discourses present within these texts, I will conduct interviews with over weight youth. A search of databases will be done to locate articles on youth weight loss surgery and the analysis will map the scientific discourses on this issue and its intersection with other bodily (e.g., discourses of obesity) and social discourses (e.g., discourses of gender). Interviews with bariatric surgeons will explore their perceptions and experiences with youth weight loss surgery as well as how they promote their services in the media. A Google text and image search will be conducted to map the textual and visual representations of youth weight loss surgery in digital media as well as the discourses they re-articulate. Interviews with overweight youth
referred for weight management will explore their perceptions of youth weight loss surgery and their constructions and experiences of their bodies and weight management. The expected outcomes are to provide knowledge on how youth weight loss surgery is represented within scientific/medical communities and digital media, and the consequences on youth. The results can raise awareness of professionals who interact with overweight youth and provide ways to improve current discourses surrounding youth weight loss surgery in the goal to improve their health."

Furthermore, the associated grief of those families affected is disenfranchised. As global health institutions and professional organizations start to prioritize the reduction of stigma around stillbirth and ensure the availability of bereavement care, Canada must also make strides in this direction.  The lack of attention to stillbirth in Canada has left health providers serving bereaved families with limited local research to guide their practice. Furthermore, while initiatives to support families affected by pregnancy and infant loss exist in some Canadian cities, these efforts remain localized and without a specific focus on stillbirth.  Following the example of parent groups in other countries who have been successful in effecting comprehensive change in stillbirth research and bereavement care, Still Life Canada: Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Education, Research and Support Society (SLC), founded by a group of bereaved families, is committed to improving support for those affected by stillbirth in Canada not only through education, but also through promoting stillbirth research. Therefore, in collaboration with SLC, a workshop/meeting is planned that will create a safe place for bereaved parents to gather, support each other, share stories, and prioritize common themes with the research team and frontline health care professionals.  The outcomes of this gathering will be used to guide bereavement programs, education of providers, policy and future research.  Although the workshop/meeting will initially focus on attendees from British Columbia, the findings will be disseminated not just provincially, but also to interested and invested stakeholders nationally at a subsequent meeting with health care professionals, educators, researchers, policy makers and community groups."

In greater Vancouver, rapid urban development, recent policy initiatives such as the creation of supportive housing for at-risk youth, and legislative changes in criminal policies around sex work and drug use (e.g., the possible decriminalization of sex work in Canada, mandatory minimums for drug sentences), have the potential to transform young people's experiences of safety, risk and harm in the places in which they live and work. The proposed ethnographic study will explore how these various changes impact young people's health over time. A key focus will be the effect of these changes on where and how young people conduct sex work (e.g., online, indoors, outdoors), and the relationship between these places and HIV and drug-related risks. I will also explore how young people's gender (their ascribed roles and relative power as men and women and sexual minorities) shapes experiences of different kinds of violence in the places where they live and work. Over a three-year study period, I will conduct participant-observation in the places frequented by young people, as well as formal and informal in-depth interviews with both young men and young women who use drugs and do sex work. In addition, I will use visual methods (e.g., the creation of photo essays, maps) to better understand young people's perspectives on risk, harm and safety in relation to different places. The results from this research will be important in informing the development of health policy and interventions that address the complex environments that shape HIV and drug-related risks, harm and safety among young people who use drugs and do sex work."

These problems persist despite the recent establishment of an array of youth services, including various harm reduction programs. While there is growing recognition that contextual factors play a central role in determining high-risk drug using behavior, there exist few in-depth investigations of drug using contexts or 'scenes' that focus on the perspectives of young drug users. Such an approach is critical to the development of meaningful policy and program interventions that seek to address the severe and preventable suffering among drug using youth.  The proposed study will employ qualitative ethnographic methodology to explore young people's understandings of the structural, social and physical landscape of the downtown Vancouver drug scene, and how this environment shapes experiences of safety and risk among drug using youth. Although new lines of inquiry are likely to emerge as the research progresses, the primary objectives of this study are: 1) to examine how young drug users are initiated into and come to understand the downtown Vancouver drug scene; 2) to examine how this landscape shapes experiences of risk (including HIV risk behavior, drug-related harms, and physical violence) among young people, and alternatively, how it facilitates situations of safety; and 3) to examine the effects of spatial exclusion as a result of urban revitalization and gentrification on experiences and understandings of safety and risk. By exploring each of these objectives, this study aims to identify those aspects of this 'risk environment' that mediate harm among young drug users, and are therefore relevant to policy and program intervention."

Many of these young people have expressed a desire to share their photo essays and narrated stories with a broader audience. A multimedia photo essay exhibit, which includes visual as well as narrative and audio content drawn from in-depth interviews, represents a valuable opportunity to showcase young people's work, as well as some of the key findings of Dr. Fast's larger ethnographic study.

Caregivers (e.g., biological, adoptive, and chosen family members, romantic partners, Elders) often play a central role in helping young people to navigate the recovery process, which frequently includes periods of reductions in substance use, substance use cessation, and renewed use.

Growing recognition of substance use disorders as ""chronic and relapsing"" can be helpful and de-stigmatizing for some YPWUD, because it can shift blame away from the individual when relapse occurs. However, research has demonstrated how this view can also lead to a sense that desired futures ""free"" from substance use are permanently closed off. Both abstinence- and chronicity-oriented approaches to recovery may be harmful for YPWUD. However, we do not yet know what alternative recovery supports might look like.

The proposed qualitative research study will employ longitudinal interviews and ethnographic fieldwork with young people (ages 14 to 24), caregivers, and providers, and community-based participatory research methods. We will work collaboratively with study participants to begin re-imagining recovery and youth-focused recovery supports, developing recommendations for best practices. A longitudinal approach to interviewing and fieldwork will permit us to examine evolving recovery ""trajectories,"" as well as the changing recovery landscape in Metro Vancouver. Working in partnership with our team's Youth Health Advisory Council (YHAC; a group of 8 youth researchers), we will generate and share study findings via creative approaches (podcast and video episodes) that center the voices and imaginations of study participants."

Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to examine incidence of prediabetes across different ethnic groups, stratifying by high and low walkability, accounting for sociodemographic, environment, and immigrant predictors. Our cohort included 274,013 immigrants (mean age 40 years) from Sub-Saharan Africa/Caribbean, South Asia, Latin America, and Western Europe. Overall, the incidence of prediabetes remained elevated among all non-Europeans groups. However, these effects were more marked in neighbourhoods that were less walkable and reduced in more walkable neighbourhoods. For example, Sub-Saharan African/Caribbeans living in low walkability areas had a twofold higher incidence of prediabetes but only 1.2 times higher in high walkability areas. Additionally, Latin Americans living in low walkability areas had a 1.5-fold higher incidence, compared with Western Europeans (referent population), but this association was not significant in high walkability areas. These patterns persisted for adults aged 20-64, but not for those aged 65+. Neighbourhood walkability may amplify the risk of prediabetes development among immigrant populations of different ethnicities, which is an important finding for guiding future policy and research directions for diabetes prevention."
Health outcomes in children of mothers who received influenza vaccination during pregnancy,"['Fell, Deshayne B']","['Ortiz, Justin', 'Benchimol, Eric I', 'Chakraborty, Pranesh K', 'Dodds, Linda', 'Hawken, Steven', 'Kwong, Jeffrey C', 'Macdonald, Nora (Noni) E', 'Sprague, Ann', 'Top, Karina A', 'Walker, Mark C', 'Wen, Shi Wu', 'Wilson, Kumanan']","['Immunization', 'Influenza', 'Maternal And Child Health', 'Population Health']",75000.0,363386,"Influenza -- also known as the flu -- is an infectious illness caused by a virus that affects the nose, throat and lungs. Most people who get the flu become mildly ill and recover quickly; but others, for example people with asthma or heart disease, may develop a more serious illness. Pregnant women are also more susceptible to serious illness and complications related to the flu, and for this reason, they are advised to get the influenza vaccination (a flu shot) each year. Despite this advice, Canadian research indicates that less than half of pregnant women actually received a flu shot in recent flu seasons. 

One reason that pregnant women might decide not to get a flu shot is due to concern about safety for their children. Many research studies done over the past several years to examine newborns whose mothers received a flu shot during pregnancy have found not only that it is safe, but also that it helps to prevent the flu in young infants who are born during the flu season. However, there is limited information on possible health benefits or concerns during the early childhood years. Our study will examine important health outcomes among children up to six years of age in order to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the long-term safety of influenza vaccination during pregnancy. Our findings will provide valuable information to pregnant women and their families, as well as to health care providers working to ensure that mothers and their children are in the best possible health."

pregnancy, which provides protection to the babies before they are fully vaccinated themselves in the early months of life. However, even in countries where pertussis vaccination is recommended and provided for free, not all pregnant women become vaccinated possibly due to ongoing concern about the safety of vaccination during pregnancy for their children.

Existing mental health services are inadequate in addressing this mental health crisis, particularly given the general ineffectiveness of mainstream approaches to mental health in Indigenous communities. Numerous studies and reports are calling for community-driven approaches to wellness and psychotherapy that support Indigenous communities in culturally relevant ways, yet many communities do not have the resources to support such approaches. In response to this literature and the immediate needs of communities in central Alberta, community stakeholders from the Rocky Mountain House region of Alberta are requesting support bringing in Indigenous psychotherapy alongside traditional wellness practices. The current study will explore community members' experiences of Indigenous Focusing-Oriented Therapy as they complete the program, and will further explore the development, implementation, and impact of community-driven cultural wellness programs in addressing the COVID-19 mental health crisis in the Rocky Mountain House region. Research conversations and focus groups will explore the impact of IFOT and cultural wellness programs on the COVID-19 mental health crisis in these communities. Findings will inform development of community-based wellness responses to the COVID-19 mental health crisis that incorporate both traditional approaches to wellness and Indigenous psychotherapy. Themes will be used to develop a framework that other Indigenous communities may draw on in creating effective community-based health initiatives. This research directly supports community-based capacity to respond to mental health crises, and will provide a foundation for further research to investigate the effectiveness of IFOT and cultural programs in addressing the mental health needs of Indigenous communities."

I use tobacco smoking as a lens to ask the following research question: how do Inuit youth appropriate or challenge the idea of authenticity in light of the Nunavut Government's assertion that ""Tobacco Was Never Part of Inuit Culture"" (Government of Nunavut, 2015)? Beginning with a close consideration of research ethics and my positionality in the field as a settler researcher, this paper critically engages with current settler research field methodologies. Instead, I examine Inuit research methods published by Healey and Tagak (2014), and discuss their practical application. I will present this research methodology in order to solicit feedback for the project."
Examining zero-fee postsecondary education as a health promotion tool in rural Alberta,"['Ferdinands, Alexa R']",['N/A'],"['Community-Based Participatory Research', 'Education', 'Health Promotion', 'Mixed Methods', 'Rural']",165000.0,472063,"Education is a well-acknowledged social determinant of health. However, postsecondary education completion rates are lower in Drayton Valley (46%), a rural oil and gas town in Alberta, than the national average in Canada (55%). Increasing postsecondary education completion rates could help to reduce some health consequences (e.g., stress, anxiety) of living through the boom-bust cycles of oil and gas, especially for financially strained residents and their families. Recognizing the importance of education in promoting community health and well-being, Drayton Valley began a zero-fee postsecondary education (ZFPE) initiative in 2019. This initiative enables residents, regardless of their financial circumstances, pursue education and training in town. Through Town partnerships with Alberta postsecondary institutions, various ZFPE programs (e.g., healthcare aide) are being offered. However, the health and social impacts of ZFPE remain unexplored.
In the Drayton Valley context, we will ask 1) how can ZFPE improve students' health outcomes? and 2) how can ZFPE shift social norms regarding postsecondary education?
Over the next 3 years, I will lead a team of research assistants to answer these questions using mixed methods, including interviews, focus groups, and surveys. Recruitment and data collection will be facilitated via pre-established relationships with Town partners. To understand ZFPE impacts, we will examine change over time in ZFPE students' health outcomes like perceived stress. We will also learn from high school students, staff, and parents about their knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs concerning postsecondary education. We will use this information to explore whether and how ZFPE can shift social norms around pursuing postsecondary education in Drayton Valley. 
Overall, findings will inform the use of ZFPE as a novel health promotion tool (currently, the only one of its kind in Canada) for use in other rural communities nationwide and internationally."
Time to Stop 'Weighting' and Start Doing: Exploring the Impact of a School-based Weight Bias Intervention,"['Ferdinands, Alexa R']",['N/A'],"['Childhood Obesity', 'Health Promotion', 'Mixed Methods', 'School-Based Intervention', 'Weight Bias']",150000.0,376643,"Weight bias is the tendency to unfairly judge a person because of his or her weight. It has many serious physical, mental, and social health outcomes, such as depression, disordered eating patterns, and avoidance of physical activity. Indeed, such negative outcomes can lead to further weight gain. In Canada, one in four children has overweight or obesity. These children face weight bias in all aspects of their lives, including at school, where weight is the most common cause of bullying. Research on ways to reduce weight bias in children is scarce. However, one promising strategy is to address weight bias in school policies and curricula. This strategy is timely given the recent focus on creating safe and caring learning environments in schools.

Partnering with the Edmonton, Alberta school community, I will lead a study to develop, implement, and assess the impact of a tailored, school-based program in reducing weight bias in Grades 1-3 students, school staff, and parents. Proposed program elements include student, school staff, and parent education and anti-weight bias policy. I will develop resources, such as lesson plans, for the program, which will be implemented for eight months in an elementary school. To assess program impact, I will examine weight bias in students, school staff, and parents before and after the program implementation period. I will also explore school staff experiences in delivering the program, in order to improve its content and design.

This research is needed to create effective strategies to reduce weight bias in schools, a public health issue affecting many Canadian children. By presenting findings to key stakeholders (e.g., Alberta Education), I hope to influence policy change to address weight bias in schools and foster positive social environments that promote children's health and well-being. This program has the potential to be scaled up for students in Grades K-12 across Canada."

We will design a workshop series centered around the creation of podcasts by community members to share their perspectives and experiences. This will be done in collaboration with knowledge users, researchers, and an expert in podcasting who will be hired for the project. We will then pilot the workshop series with 20 GBQM and the podcasts will be analyzed, building new knowledge about chemsex among GBQM. Finally, we will disseminate the podcasts broadly to encourage and facilitate nuanced conversations about chemsex and HIV/STBBIs prevention within the GBQM community and among health care professionals and policymakers."

Our idea: We will conduct research to inform the development of an online suicide prevention training (gatekeeper training) for SGM that will then be piloted and evaluated. Our approach: Our 5-year study includes 4 phases: Phase 1: To inform the development of a suicide prevention training for SGM we will a) conduct a systematic review to describe successful strategies for online suicide prevention trainings, b) interview 90 SGM individuals who have provided or received peer support in the context of suicide to understand their needs and desires in terms of an online suicide prevention training, and c) interview 30 suicide prevention and SGM health experts to identify the key components of a SGM specific suicide training. Phase 2: We will integrate the knowledge and insights gained in phase 1 to design, with stakeholders and potential users, an online suicide prevention training specific to SGM. Phase 3: We will pilot the training and use a pre-post design to evaluate the training outcomes. Focus groups will also be conducted to evaluate the satisfaction of those taking the training. Phase 4:  we will disseminate and mobilize our results widely to stimulate the promotion of suicide prevention with SGM. IMPACT: Our novel study among SGM is urgent considering the high rates of suicidality among SGM. Our design to inform the development of the intervention is comprehensive and will offer a solid foundation to build an evidence-based training while simultaneously stimulating the development of additional interventions."
Developing resilience to obesogenic food environments through food literacy,"['Fernandez, Melissa A']",['N/A'],"['Child And Adolescent Health', 'Cross-Sectional Survey', 'Environmental Scan', 'Food Environments', 'Food Literacy', 'Food Skills', 'Mixed Methods', 'Nutrition', 'Participatory Action Research']",165000.0,376099,"More Canadians now die from diseases caused by poor diet than from smoking-related illnesses, and diets low in fruit and vegetable intake cost Canadians 3.3 billion dollars a year. The food environment profoundly influences diet and is associated with diseases such as obesity and diabetes. This environment has evolved so that children and adolescents are constantly fed cues to consume unhealthy foods. Nutrition ""knowledge"" may come from social media or advertisements and slick marketing may shape food preferences. All of these factors affect current and future dietary practices. Food literacy is the foundation of healthy dietary practices and provides youth with an opportunity to build resilience to unhealthy food environments. Yet, we know very little about how food literacy is acquired and the level of literacy needed to make healthy dietary decisions. The proposed research will address these knowledge gaps. The purpose of this study is to examine the connections between food literacy, food environments and health indicators among youth. To address the knowledge gaps, we will conduct 1) an environmental scan of food literacy learning opportunities for children and adolescents (consisting of a scoping review, interviews with practitioners followed by a survey) and 2) a cross-sectional survey on food literacy, food environments and health indicators among youth. Results will be translated to practitioners and policy makers through guidelines for enhancing food literacy to promote optimal health. Food literacy will equip youth with the abilities, knowledge and self-efficacy to make healthy food choices, which will reduce risk for diseases and decrease healthcare costs. This research will strengthen Health Canada's healthy eating strategy to improve healthy eating and protect vulnerable populations by understanding how to improve food literacy and make healthy dietary choices in unhealthy food environments."

Families have an opportunity to influence children's attitudes and behaviors related to food and eating through parenting style, behavior modeling and shared environment. While it is strongly believed that food skills and eating family meals are linked to healthier diets, there is very little data to support these beliefs. Nevertheless, population wide nutrition campaigns have promoted the importance of having strong food skills and sharing family meals. In 2013, Health Canada developed the Eat Well Campaign: Food Skills (EWC) to promote meal planning, preparation and family meals to Canadian parents. The EWC was comprehensive nutrition promotion campaign that was launched with the help of many partners from the food industry, the media and health organizations, but nothing is known about the impacts of this campaign on Canadians or how these partners were involved. The goals of this study are to 1) describe Health Canada's partners' experience working on a healthy eating campaign, 2) determine which parents were aware of the EWC, and if the campaign was successful in improving their food skills and participation in family meals and 3) examine the relationships between food skills, family meals and diet quality among Canadian parents. Interviews were conducted over the phone with Health Canada's partners to collect information about their participation in the EWC. Canadian parents from across the country were invited to complete four surveys that collected information on parents' demographics, exposure to the EWC, thoughts of the campaign, family eating behaviors and diet quality. The results from the study will help to answer questions about the links between diet and food skills, and whether or not a healthy eating campaign based on food skills had an impact on Canadians."
Facilitators and barriers that federal cross-sector partners experienced while implementing a national healthy eating campaign,"['Fernandez, Melissa A']",['N/A'],"['Barriers', 'Cross-Sector Partnerships', 'Facilitators', 'Ics Travel Awards', 'Implementation', 'Nutrition Promotion', 'Qualitative']",1328.0,343348,"Health Canada developed a social marketing campaign to promote food skills and nutrition to Canadian parents with young children. The Eat Well Campaign: Food Skills campaign was advertised to parents from 2013 to 2014 with the help of Health Canada's partners from the retail food industry, the media and health organizations. The purpose of this study was to describe the facilitators and barriers that Health Canada's partners experienced while working on the Eat Well Campaign. A sample of 21 partners participated in semi-structured interviews that were recorded and transcribed word-for-word. Word analysis software was used to analyse the interviews by dividing the text fragments that were tagged with codes. These codes were used to identify facilitators and barriers of working on the Eat Well Campaign. The five facilitating themes that emerged were related to resources, partners, Health Canada, the partnership and the intervention. Among these themes, the most facilitating subthemes were the nature of the campaign, good communication with Health Canada, good quality materials, good relationships with Health Canada and the understanding, flexible and implicated character of the partners. The emergent barriers varried greatly. The most significant barriers were related to time (tight timeline, information provided too late by HC and delays) and limited financial resources. Other important barriers included issues with the Eat Well Campaign messaging, the lack of visibility of the campaign, competing priorities with the campaing and Health Canada's approval process. In conclusion, when partners collaborate with agencies like Health Canada, they are likely to appreciate the opportunity to build a relationship with them. Minimizing barriers such as tight timelines and the approval process will make working with Health Canada on public health promotion activities easier, which will likely enhance the impacts of their collaborative initiatives."

Mobility scooters are the most popular form of powered mobility device and are used by nearly 100,000 Canadians, primarily older adults. Scooters are powered wheeled assistive mobility devices designed for people who have good upper body control but difficulty walking (Russell et al. 1997; LaPlante 2003). In 2006, scooter sales exceeded powered wheelchair sales by a ratio of 2:1 in Canada and 4:1 in the U.K. (Statistics Canada 2006). Scooter users face significant challenges maneuvering both indoors and outdoors. There is a particularly limited understanding of scooter performance outdoors in winter environments. Ice, snow, and slush pose serious challenges to safe independent mobility for these users. These conditions can cause slipping making it difficult to stop safely and maintain desired direction. They can also increase the potential for sliding and tipping accidents, especially when turning or traveling over sloped surfaces adjacent to curbs.  There are currently no standard tests for evaluating scooter performance in winter. Standard tests are necessary as they allow consumers and clinicians to make informed decisions on the selection of scooters. Standard tests are also necessary to provide manufacturers with minimum performance criteria and a test method to substantiate outdoor performance claims. We propose 4 studies which will result in the development of standard tests of winter performance for mobility scooters, an evaluation of a range of currently available scooters, and target areas for overcoming the mobility problems faced by the large and growing population of elderly scooter users in winter. Toronto Rehab's new laboratories make it possible to safely study scooter performance in a variety of controlled and reproducible challenging winter environments, as proposed in this study. Pilot testing has shown the feasibility of this approach."

Research reveals considerable overlap between the risk factors for OB and EDs. Yet, collaboration between the two fields remains strained largely due to differences in philosophies and training. Discourses have been initiated in the form of discussion papers and knowledge exchange events about how to break down the silos between the two fields. To date, no study has gathered empirical data on how practitioners, researchers, policy makers, and the general public perceive these health issues. The Beyond Obesity and Disordered Eating in Youth (BODY) study is a qualitative project that sheds light on the different meanings that individuals attribute to the ""body shape and weight trouble"". Data have been collected across Canada through interviews conducted with 35 researchers/practitioners who work in either EDs or OB (for a total of 70 in-depth interviews) and five focus groups conducted with 26 youth (aged 16-26). The proposed paper will unpack the basic assumptions, discourses, and practices alive in the eating disorder and obesity prevention ""camps."" In particular, I will focus on: (1) How and why two ""camps"" exist; (2) The existent ""myths"" alive between them and there consequences; and (3) How practitioners morally position themselves in the two ""camps"" debate and how this influence current prevention work. Finally, I will introduce a new ethical framework, called Corporeal Ethics, which aims to achieve both gender equity and equality in current prevention practices by being more in harmony with the bodily reality and experiences of youth."

It is estimated that each year around 250,000 immigrants arrive in Canada and, according to the 2006 Statistics Canada Census, two-thirds of the country's population growth was due to net international migration. The scale of this migration has been of considerable health policy interest for some time, with several studies finding that immigrants often face multiple barriers when accessing health care services, mainly in the areas of language, location, cost, community awareness and cultural competency. Cultural competency has been defined as a set of congruent behaviours, attitudes and policies that come together as a system, agency or among professionals and enable them to work effectively in cross-cultural situations. In the health care context, cultural competency has been linked to improved patient satisfaction with care, better understanding of medical instruction and positive changes in the health status of the population. The purpose of this research thesis project is to understand how cultural competency in the communication relationship between the providers and immigrant patients acts as an enabler or barrier to health. This is particularly timely, given that, with few exceptions, most studies have focused solely on the service provider's perspective and experience of caring for diverse patient populations. A culturally diverse population will be sampled to ascertain how different cultural groups negotiate cross-culturally with their health care practitioner and the larger Canadian primary health care system. A series of interviews will be conducted over a six month period to identify the frequency and relevance of the barriers experienced by the participants. The information obtained on cultural competence will be used to help provide high-quality primary health care to Canada's growing and diverse population."

However, given the normal challenges of childhood and adolescence and stress of having a chronic physical condition managing multimorbidity in youth is difficult, but critical. We will determine how and why some youth develop multimorbidity, while others do not, because this knowledge is essential for establishing interventions to improve outcomes. Building on our successful feasibility study, we will document the course of mental health symptoms over time, as well as identify individual, family, and community predictors of mental disorder among 504 youth with chronic physical conditions. We will also examine whether the effects of these predictors are amplified or act through other psychosocial and biological variables such as poverty or physical activity. Furthermore, we will assess the extent to which multimorbidity increases the amount or alters patterns of psychiatric services usage among youth. We will enroll youth aged 2-17 years with a variety of chronic physical conditions (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy) receiving outpatient care at McMaster Children's Hospital and follow them for 24 months. We will also enroll a subset of age-matched healthy sibling controls. We will use provincial health care data to confirm psychiatric diagnoses and service use. Advanced statistical modeling will be used to estimate trajectories of health outcomes. With rare exceptions, previous studies were cross-sectional and none examined the extent to which youth multimorbidity impacts the amount of psychiatric services youth access. Preventing youth multimorbidity is essential to improve youth trajectories, strengthen families, and in turn, improve care and reduce costs."
COVID-19 Effects on Mental Health and Service Provision Effects on Children and Families: The MY LIFE Experience,"['Ferro, Mark']","['Gorter, Jan Willem', 'Lipman, Ellen L', 'Reaume, Shannon V', 'Meyer, Samantha', 'Yessis, Jennifer L']","['Acute Psychological Distress', 'Family-Centred Care', 'Mixed Methods', 'Physical-Mental Comorbidity']",165000.0,432566,"Children with co-occurring physical and mental illness, or multimorbidity, have poorer quality of life and use more health services. The parents of children with multimorbidity also experience poor mental health. These burdens are likely amplified by the COVID-19 and subsequent countermeasures to reduce transmission such as school closures, cancelled medical appointments, and physical distancing. Understanding the extent to which COVID-19 has affected the mental health of these vulnerable children and their families is needed to support these individuals during COVID-19 and plan for future crises. Further, the advent of virtual mental health care such as video conferencing has given rise to new challenges. Best practices suggest that health care for children should be family-centred, focusing on the needs of the child in the context of their family environment. But, it is unknown if the delivery of virtual health care is perceived by children with multimorbidity and their parents as family-centred and how virtual health care in the era of COVID-19 impacts mental health. We will engage families already recruited in our ongoing longitudinal study child multimorbidity to investigate the changes in the mental health of children and parents in the time prior to, during, and after COVID-19 countermeasures; examine if virtual mental health care, in response to COVID-19, is family-centred, and understand child and parent perceptions of health care needs for individual and family mental health. Our study includes 263 families who will complete mail surveys and participate in online qualitative interviews that will ask about mental health care needs in the context of COVID-19. Because our sample of families is already engaged with our research team, we can quickly obtain and summarize research findings that can be used by health professionals, families, and policy makers to allocate resources to best support the mental health of children and their families during COVID-19."

This level of burden has tremendous public health implications given that these children report compromised quality of life that extends throughout life, have parents and families that experience elevated stress, and use considerably more health services resulting in increased health system costs for society. Unfortunately, very little research has comprehensively examined co-occurring physical and mental illness in children. Thus, using a contemporary representative sample of Canadian children, our study will estimate the proportion of children with physical-mental comorbidity; identify predictors and outcomes of child physical-mental comorbidity; and, investigate how child physical-mental comorbidity impacts the use of mental health services. These objectives will be addressed using cross-sectional data from 92,170 children aged <18 years and their primary-caregiving parent who were participants in the 2019 Canadian Health Survey on Children and Youth (CHSCY). Findings will help us develop programs and services to promote mental health in children with physical illness, prevent the onset of physical-mental comorbidity, and provide appropriate treatment to children with physical-mental comorbidity and their families. Ultimately, our research will support the health and well-being of children with physical illness and aim to improve integrated care for physical-mental comorbidity in childhood. Because data from the CHSCY were collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, they provide a robust baseline for future studies to examine how the mental health of children with and without physical illnesses may change post-pandemic."

Findings from the first 24 months of MY LIFE showed that 25% to 40% of children with a chronic physical illness (e.g., asthma, epilepsy) also had a mental illness (e.g., depression, anxiety), otherwise known as multimorbidity. Child age, sex, and disability level, as well as caregiver mental health and family socioeconomic status were associated with increased risk of multimorbidity. Some studies show that some children with physical illness do well and have good mental health; however, little is known about their health as these individuals change from children with a new illness to young adults living with their condition(s). Working with our Family Advisory Board which comprises youth and caregivers with lived experience, the goal of this proposal is to understand the long-term mental health outcomes of individuals in MY LIFE-now, youth aged 7 to 20 years-by investigating whose mental health improves over time, remains the same, and declines, and under what circumstances. We will learn whether new patterns of multimorbidity emerge as children mature during adolescence and young adulthood, which factors predict mental illness over time, and contrast use of mental health services for children who are now young adults. Including siblings allows us to control for shared family environments in the context of multimorbidity, and opportunities to link our data with provincial health records ensures that our estimates of service use are accurate, particularly during key life events (e.g., starting college/university) and to understand how changes in services use correlate with mental health. Ultimately, this study will generate the information needed to prevent mental health declines in youth with physical illness."

Our early results showed that 30% to 40% of children living with a long-term physical illness, like asthma or epilepsy, also had a mental illness, like depression or anxiety. We call this multimorbidity. We found that a child's age, sex, and level of disability, their caregiver's mental health and the family's income level were related to whether a child or youth would experience multimorbidity. Some research shows that some children and youth who have a long-term physical illness have good mental health, but we don't know what happens as children and youth get older and become young adults. Working with young people and family members with lived experience, our research goal is to understand the long-term mental health of children and youth who are part of the MY LIFE study and who are now aged 8 to 21 years. We will look at whose mental health improves over time, remains the same, and declines, and what things affect these changes. We will look at whether new patterns of multimorbidity start as children get older, what things about their lives are related to their mental illness over time, and look at how their use of mental health services changes as they get older. We will also include the brothers and sisters of the children and youth participating in our study to allow us to make comparisons to children and youth who are in the same family. We will link our data with health services data collected by the provincial government as this gives us good quality information about service use. This study will create new knowledge needed to help support mental health in children and youth living with physical illness."

Oncofertility among adolescent and young adult cancer survivors in Alberta: a mixed methods study,"['Fidler-Benaoudia, Miranda M']","['Barr, Ronald D', 'Crawford, Susan', 'Fiest, Kirsten M', 'Foong, Shu', 'Greenblatt, Ellen M', 'Maxwell, Cynthia V', 'McKillop, Sarah', 'Metcalfe, Amy L', 'Pole, Jason D', 'Przybylski, Peter', 'Roberts, Jeffrey E', 'Walker, Lauren']","['Adolescent And Young Adult Cancer', 'Fertility', 'Late Effects', 'Mixed Methods', 'Oncofertility', 'Survivorship']",612000.0,420133,"Each year, approximately 7,600 adolescents and young adults (AYAs; aged 15-39 years) are diagnosed with cancer in Canada. Since people are having children later in life now, more AYA cancer patients have not started a family at the time of diagnosis. As a result, fertility is the second biggest concern among AYA cancer patients because previous research has found that radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatments can cause infertility.

Although fertility counseling before cancer treatment is recommended as a part of standard AYA cancer care, it is unclear how often it is being used. Also, no one has explored how many AYA cancer patients have cancer-related fertility appointments or use fertility services before or after cancer treatment. 

Thus, this proposal's aim is to understand the impact of cancer and its treatment during adolescence and young adulthood on fertility by using a mixed methods study to explore cancer-related fertility care in Alberta. Specifically, among AYA cancer patients from Alberta that were diagnosed from 2010-2019, our first objective is to assess:
-referrals to fertility services;
-appointment attendance at a fertility clinic;
-fertility procedures (and what kind); and
-fertility-related financial costs.
For Objective 2, we will use a mail-out to invite AYA cancer survivors to complete an electronic questionnaire that will collect information on fertility and sexual health factors, as well as demographics. This questionnaire will then be used to identify participants for focus groups (Objective 3) that will explore psychological and social factors that influence reproductive experiences and choices, as well as the impact of cancer on family building among survivors and their partners.

The results of this study will help us understand how AYA cancer patients' fertility is impacted by cancer, and may lead to clinical or policy recommendations in Alberta and beyond."
AYA-PACT: Adolescents and Young Adults becoming Physically Active after Cancer Trial,"['Fidler-Benaoudia, Miranda M', 'Friedenreich, Christine M']","['Barr, Ronald D', 'Courneya, Kerry S', 'Duhamel, Todd A', 'Logie, Natalie', 'McKillop, Sarah', 'Mcneil, Jessica N', 'Parrilla Lopez (Santana), Maria Jose', 'Schulte, Fiona S', 'Sigal, Ronald J', 'Thorpe, Kevin E']","['Adolescent And Young Adult', 'Cancer', 'Late Effects', 'Physical Activity', 'Physical Health', 'Psychosocial Heatlh', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Survivorship']",952425.0,433219,"Background: 
There is a need for adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer research because the number of new cancers in young people is increasing and the survivor population is growing. Interventions that try to reduce problems that affect people after cancer are particularly important since its treatments can have negative effects on survivors' physical and mental health even decades after diagnosis.

Aim: 
Given the many positive effects of physical activity (e.g. improved fitness and quality of life), our study aims to encourage AYA cancer survivors to be more physically active as they shift from treatment to survivorship care. The main goal of this study is to see if a home-based, mobile health (mHealth) physical activity intervention can increase physical activity levels by at least 90 minutes/week compared to baseline in AYA cancer survivors.

Methods: 
We will conduct a two-center randomized controlled trial of 320 AYA cancer survivors living in Alberta and within 12 months of completing treatment. At the start of the study, participants will complete fitness testing and questionnaires. Participants will then be randomly put into either a control or intervention group. The control group will receive educational information only. The intervention group will also receive a personalized physical activity plan, an activity tracker watch, access to a private, online survivor community, motivational text messages and check-in calls/e-mails. Fitness testing and questionnaires will be repeated at 6 and 12 months to see if the intervention increased physical activity levels and improved health outcomes among the participants in the intervention group compared to controls. A final measurement at 24 months will test long-term use.

Impact: 
This study could provide AYA cancer survivors with a simple and affordable mHealth intervention that benefits their physical and mental health. If our intervention works in Alberta, we aim to test its effectiveness nationally."

These individuals fall between childhood and adult cancer care programs, and have complex needs because they were diagnosed with cancer during critical developmental, social, and reproductive years. A primary concern among AYAs with cancer is fertility. Because more women are having children later in life, many AYA patients will not have had a child when they are diagnosed with cancer. Previous research has found that cancer therapies can lead to high-risk pregnancies or infertility, and thus the possibility of having future children after cancer is uncertain for these survivors. 

To date, limited information is available to guide women and doctors about pregnancy after cancer at a young age. In this study, we will look at the impact of cancer on subsequent pregnancy complications and outcomes. Using a Canadian cohort of AYA cancer survivors, we will assess: 
1.the rate of abortions, stillbirths, and live births,
2.the degree of complications in mothers and newborns, and 
3.whether risks of these complications and outcomes change with time from diagnosis or treatment period. 

These points will also be explored using more detailed data from Alberta to establish the effect of radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment, and develop recommendations for doctors. For all outcomes, we will compare AYA cancer survivors to the general population so that the results can be translated easily and clearly. 

The results of this study will add to the current understanding of pregnancy after cancer by providing evidence to support a hands-on approach to fertility counselling at diagnosis, as well as greater monitoring of pregnancies and deliveries in this vulnerable group."

Worldwide, over 100 million women use birth control pills.  One known side effect of taking birth control pills is an increased chance of having blood clots compared with not taking these pills.  Recent safety reviews conducted by Health Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have found that the newest type of birth control pills, which contains the hormone drosperinone, has been linked to the increased formation of potentially life-threatening blood clots (called venous thrombosis) compared with other types of birth control pills.  However, these reviews primarily focused on the venous side of the circulatory system.  While the FDA did look at the arterial side of the circulatory system, which includes both the heart and the brain, the results of their analysis conflict with those of other studies.  With only conflicting data available and millions of women taking these pills worldwide, additional studies are urgently needed to determine if these pills are safe.  If they increase the risk of arterial blood clots such as heart attacks or strokes, we may be greatly underestimating the harmful effects of these pills.  For this reason, we will use data from a United Kingdom database called the General Practice Research Database to study this important drug safety question.  Using this database, we will identify all women who took birth control pills between 2000 and 2012.  Once these women are identified, we will compare the number of women who had heart attacks and strokes while taking each of the different types of birth control pills.  This two-year study will provide a complete picture of the safety profile of these birth control pills.  In doing so, it will provide regulatory agencies such as Health Canada, doctors, and patients with the information required to make informed decisions regarding the risks and benefits of these pills."

It is sold under the trade name Champix.  Previous studies have shown that it is the most effective pill used to help people stop smoking.  However, there is now some evidence that varenicline may have harmful effects on people's hearts and that it might increase the chances of having a heart attack.  Government agencies like Health Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are currently studying the safety of varenicline.  Unfortunately, available information about its safety is limited.  For this reason, more studies are needed to determine if varenicline causes heart problems in people who are trying to stop smoking.  The proposed study will examine the safety of varenicline using information from the General Practice Research Database, or GPRD.  The GPRD is a database that contains the medical records for more than 11 million people in the United Kingdom.  We will use the GPRD to identify two groups of patients: those who took varenicline and those who took bupropion.  We will then compare the number of people in each group that had a heart attack in the 3 months after they started taking the pill.  We will also check if varenicline increases the chances of dying or being hospitalized for a stroke, heart failure, or heart operations.  To perform these comparisons, we will use a new type of statistical analysis called high-dimensional propensity scores.  This study will take 2 years to complete.  If varenicline increases the chances of having heart problems, patients and doctors need to know about these potential side effects.  On the other hand, if varenicline is safe, they need to know so that it can be prescribed to help people stop smoking.  Either way, this study will have important clinical and public health implications."
Trends in Smoking and Smoking-Related Behaviors: The Minnesota Heart Survey,"['Filion, Kristian B']",['N/A'],"['Biomarkers', 'Cardiovascular Disease', 'Public Health', 'Smoking', 'Surveillance']",50000.0,203093,"The harmful cardiovascular effects of cigarette smoking are well established.  To reduce the number of people who smoke, many therapies have been developed.  Population-level changes have also taken place, including increased taxation, stricter advertising laws, and restricted smoking in public places. And while the proportion of people who smoke has decreased, the effects of these changes in the general population are not well studied. This is especially true among children and the elderly. Study of the smoking practices among children and adolescents is needed to better predict its future burden on our society. Study of the elderly is important with the aging population. The investigation of contemporary smoking and smoking-related behaviors (such as how many times people try to quit, how they quit, and why they quit) is essential to address these questions. 

Recently, a number of biological indicators, or biomarkers, have been identified that may allow for the early identification of patients at high risk of having a cardiovascular event such as a heart attack.  Although both smoking and these biomarkers are predictors of cardiovascular events, it remains unknown if smoking modifies the ability of these biomarkers to predict future events.

The Minnesota Heart Survey is an ongoing survey of cardiovascular risk factors in the Minneapolis/Saint Paul metropolitan area.  It is currently in its 29th year and recently completed its 6th survey.  Participants were randomly selected from the community.  Participation involved a face-to-face interview at home, followed by a clinic visit.  This project will examine trends in smoking and smoking-related behaviors.  We will pay particular attention to these trends among children, adolescents, and the elderly.  Finally, using blood samples that were taken during the clinic visit, we will examine if smoking changes the predictive ability of these biomarkers."

It often disappears after the baby is born.  However, gestational diabetes increases the chances of later developing type 2 diabetes, an important risk factor for heart disease.

We will address this question using information from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, or CPRD.  The CPRD is a United Kingdom-based database.  It contains medical records for over 12 million patients seen at over 425 general practitioner practices.  We will include all pregnant women in the CPRD between 1990 and 2012.  We will compare the number of women who develop heart disease among those with gestational diabetes to that among pregnant women without gestational diabetes.  In addition, we will determine how much of the increased risk of heart disease can be explained by the development of type 2 diabetes.  Finally, we will examine if considering gestational diabetes in addition to traditional heart disease risk factors such cholesterol, blood pressure, and obesity improves our ability to predict which women will get heart disease."

While they have several benefits, their safety is controversial.  Current evidence regarding their effects on the kidneys is conflicting.  The results of some clinical trials suggest that these drugs may have harmful effects on the kidneys but those of other trials suggest that they do not.  Given these conflicting data, there is an urgent need to examine this potential side effect. It is particularly important to do so using real-world data from patients seen as part of everyday clinical practice. Our objective is to compare the risks of hospitalization for acute kidney injury and other adverse kidney outcomes with incretin-based drugs to those of combinations of oral antidiabetic drugs.  To accomplish this objective, we will use data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. This database contains the medical records of 691 general practitioner practices in the United Kingdom. Using this database, we will identify all newly-treated patients with type 2 diabetes.  We will then compare the rates of adverse kidney outcomes among patients taking incretin-based drugs to those of patients taking combinations of oral antidiabetic drugs.  Outcomes we will examine are hospitalization for acute kidney injury, dialysis, death from kidney disease, and doubling of creatinine level (a marker of kidney disease). Kidney disease is common in patients with type 2 diabetes and is associated with poor long-term outcomes.  The study of the effects of drugs used to treat diabetes on the kidneys is therefore essential.

If we find that incretin-based drugs are harmful for patients' kidneys, we will alert relevant knowledge users to this important side effect. In contrast, if we find that they are not, our study will provide reassurance regarding their safety. Thus, regardless of its results, this study will have important policy, clinical, and public health implications."

Over the past several years, the use of opioids has increased dramatically. However, opioids are addictive and can result in abuse and fatal overdoses.  Concerns of opioid abuse and opioid-related deaths have resulted in the increasing use of tramadol. Tramadol is an opioid drug that is effective at relieving pain but it has a lower risk of addiction and abuse than other opioids. It decreases pain, in part, by increasing the body's serotonin levels.  However, increased serotonin levels may also increase the risk of having heart problems.  With no high quality studies examining the effect of tramadol on the risk of having heart problems, there is an urgent need to do so. 

Our study will use a database from the United Kingdom called the Clinical Practice Research Datalink to answer this question. This database has the electronic medical records for over 14 million patients. We will compare the chances of having heart problems between patients who use tramadol and those who use the opioid codeine. The main outcome that we will study will be heart attacks. Other outcomes that we will study will be chest pain, surgery to open blocked arteries in the heart, strokes, irregular heartbeats, and death. 

If we find that tramadol increases the risk of having heart problems, we will alert Health Canada, doctors, and patients to this risk. In contrast, if they do not, our study will provide reassurance regarding the safety of this drug. Given the increasing use of tramadol in Canada, this study will have important policy, clinical, and public health implications."

Nonetheless, the risk of CVD remains poorly understood in women. Over the last ten years, the rates of pregnancy complications such as hypertension in pregnancy and gestational diabetes have steadily increased. Previous studies have shown that women with a history of complications of pregnancy are at higher risk of future CVD. However, tools currently used by physicians to predict CVD risk do not consider complications of pregnancy and the corresponding earlier onset of CVD risk factors. Furthermore, these tools were developed over 20 years ago in older adult populations that are not representative of the general population or current clinical practice. There is therefore a need to develop a method to predict CVD that accounts for complications in pregnancy.
 
We will develop two predictive models to determine the 5-year risk of CVD (including stroke, heart attack, or blocked arteries) among women who have recently given birth. The first model, which will be developed using a database from the United Kingdom called the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, will include extensive clinical information to answer this question. The second model, which will be developed using the British Columbia Perinatal Data Registry, will be a simplified model that will be more easily used in routine clinical practice. These models will allow for contemporary assessment of CVD risk in women and assess the value of pregnancy-related information when determining CVD risk. 
  
This study will provide physicians with the information needed to better predict CVD risk in women and to identify which women would benefit from the closer monitoring and the early initiation of CVD prevention. Given the clinical and economic consequences of CVD in women and the availability of effective interventions to prevent CVD, the results of this study will have substantial clinical and population health implications."

It is well established as an important risk factor for heart attacks, strokes, and other heart diseases. It affects approximately 23% of Canadian adults. There is an ongoing debate regarding the most beneficial approach to treat patients with hypertension, with some recent treatment guidelines advocating for a more aggressive approach (defined by a lower target BP level) while others maintaining a more conservative one.  There is clear evidence supporting the use of an aggressive approach among patients at high risk of heart disease.  However, little evidence is available regarding those at low risk.  To address this knowledge gap and facilitate the practice of personalized medicine, we will investigate varied BP control plans using real-world data extracted from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. This database contains the medical records of over 13 million patients seen by general practitioners in the United Kingdom.  We will include all patients who started any drug used to treat hypertension between 1998 and 2019. We will first describe the treatment patterns over time and identify potential factors that may lead to a treatment change. We will investigate whether following a lower target BP decreases the rate of heart diseases compared with a higher target BP among patients at low risk of heart diseases. Finally, a personalized BP control plan will be investigated using sophisticated statistical approaches. Heart disease remains the leading cause of death worldwide. Through its use of big data and a personalized medicine approach, this study will identify the optimal approach to the management of hypertension for the prevention of heart diseases in patients at low risk, a large yet understudied population.  In doing so, it will prevent heart attacks, strokes, and other heart disease, and it improve the health of patients in Canada and elsewhere with hypertension."
The Safety of Antipsychotic Drugs Among Children and Youth With Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder,"['Filion, Kristian B']","['Henderson, Melanie', 'Lefebvre, Claire', 'Masarwa, Reem', 'Platt, Robert W', 'Renoux, Christel']","['Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder', 'Cardiac Safety', 'Children', 'Cohort Study', 'Comparative Safety', 'Diabetes', 'Drug Safety', 'Obesity', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Population Health']",175951.0,443941,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental health disorder characterized by hyperactive and impulsive behaviors. Treatments include cognitive behavioral therapy and prescription drugs (e.g., Ritalin), which are prescribed when behavioral therapies are not sufficient to improve symptoms.  Antipsychotic drugs are not approved for use among children with behavioral problems such as ADHD. However, antipsychotic drugs are increasingly being prescribed to children with such conditions despite the minimal evidence available regarding their safety when used in this setting.  Recently, safety concerns have emerged regarding possible harmful effects, including potential increased risks of metabolic disease (overweight or obesity), diabetes, cardiac arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms), and cardiac death (dying due to heart problems).

Clinical trials conducted in children mainly addressed whether antipsychotic drugs are effective. Their safety has only been examined in a limited number of studies conducted in real-world settings.   These studies examined the risks of weight gain, diabetes, and death among children prescribed antipsychotic drugs for ADHD.  However, these studies had important methodological flaws. In addition, the use of antipsychotic drugs for ADHD is typically at much lower doses than for other conditions and in conjunction with approved ADHD drugs. High quality studies that use real-world data are needed to evaluate the safety of antipsychotic drugs among children with ADHD. To address this knowledge gap, we will use data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a large clinical database. We will compare the risks of overweight or obesity, diabetes, high cholesterol levels, and heart problems among children with ADHD prescribed antipsychotics versus approved ADHD drugs. This study will provide regulatory agencies with important information on the safety of ""off-label"" use antipsychotic drugs in this vulnerable population."

It can lead to harmful short-term (e.g., preterm birth) and long-term outcomes (e.g., heart disease) for both the mother and child. Proper control of a woman' blood sugar level is crucial in preventing these complications. Drugs are given to women who are not able to meet their target blood sugar levels through lifestyle interventions. Although insulin is the recommended treatment for gestational diabetes, it is inconvenient because it requires increased medical visits, injections, and intensive self-monitoring of one's blood sugar level. Insulin also is known to cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Metformin, a drug used to treat diabetes that is taken orally, may represent an alternative treatment. However, there are safety concerns surrounding its use during pregnancy that require further investigation. There is currently no clear consensus regarding the effectiveness and safety of using metformin for gestational diabetes due to the limitations of the available evidence in this area. 

We will address this knowledge gap by conducting a study using the electronic health records of pregnant women with gestational diabetes in the United Kingdom using a database called the Clinical Practice Research Datalink. We will compare the occurrence of pregnancy outcomes with metformin to that with insulin. We will also study outcomes among the offspring.  We will use rigorous statistical techniques to obtain valid treatment effects. This study will generate real-world evidence to help inform decisions made by government agencies, guideline writing committees, clinicians, and pregnant women. In doing so, it will improve the health of pregnant women with gestational diabetes and their offspring. With a growing number of women with gestational diabetes worldwide, this study will have important clinical and population health implications."
Comparative Effectiveness and Safety of Long-acting Insulins and Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) Insulin among Patients with Type 2 Diabetes,"['Filion, Kristian B']","['Brunetti, Vanessa C', 'Platt, Robert W', 'Yu, Oriana Hoi Yun']","['Cardiovascular Events', 'Cohort Study', 'Comparative Effectiveness', 'Drug Safety', 'Hypoglycemia', 'Insulin', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Population Health', 'Type 2 Diabetes']",137700.0,435226,"Type 2 diabetes is characterized by elevated blood sugar levels.  Treatments include lifestyle modification (e.g., diet, exercise), use of oral drugs, and then insulin when other treatments fail to control blood sugar levels. However, insulin can cause potential side effects, including severe low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Newer insulins that have a more gradual effect and control blood sugar levels for a longer time entered the market over the last two decades (long-acting insulins).  These insulins are believed to have a lower risk of hypoglycemia compared to the older insulin types that stay in the body for a shorter time (intermediate-acting insulins). 

Benefits of long-acting insulins were observed in clinical trials with respect to hypoglycemia.  However, these trials were conducted in highly-selected patients that are different from those seen in everyday clinical practice. Some studies have examined the effect of these newer insulins on the occurrence of heart-related events and hypoglycemia using data from patients seen in routine clinical practice, but they had important flaws and did not compare all available long-acting insulins. Higher quality studies that use real-world clinical data are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of long-acting insulins. To do this, we will use data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD).  We will first compare the effectiveness of long-acting insulins and intermediate-acting insulins (called NPH insulin) at preventing heart attacks, strokes, and dying of heart problems. We will then compare the risk of severe low blood sugar in patients using these different types of insulin. This study will provide regulatory agencies, clinicians, and patients with important information on the use of these insulins for the management of type 2 diabetes."
Comparative Effectiveness of Long-acting Insulins and Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH) Insulin for the Prevention of Micro- and Macrovascular Complications Among Patients with Type 1 Diabetes,"['Filion, Kristian B']","['Brophy, James M', 'Douros, Antonios', 'Platt, Robert W', 'salmasi, shahrzad', 'Yu, Oriana Hoi Yun']","['Cardiovascular Events', 'Cohort Study', 'Comparative Effectiveness', 'Insulin', 'Nephropathy', 'Neuropathy', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Population Health', 'Retinopathy', 'Type 1 Diabetes']",213818.0,467664,"Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is a chronic condition that stops the body from producing insulin, an important protein responsible for the regulation of blood sugar levels. It affects 9 million people worldwide. Patients with T1DM commonly develop many complications that affect the health of their eyes, kidneys, nerves, and heart. These complications reduce the life expectancy of patients with T1DM by 8 to 13 years. T1DM is managed by lifelong injection of insulin multiple times per day. In recent years, a new type of synthetic insulin (long-acting insulins) entered the market.  They offer longer insulin coverage, lower variability in blood sugar levels, better blood sugar control, and a lower chance of dangerous drops in blood sugar levels compared to neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, albeit at a much higher price. The main goal of insulin therapy, however, is the prevention of diabetic complications. To date, no studies have investigated if long-acting insulins are better at reducing the rates of T1DM complications compared to NPH. Such information will be pivotal to inform clinical decision-making and to ensure that use of the more expensive long-acting insulins is justified. We will compare the rates of long-term complications between patients who use long-acting insulin and those who use NPH insulin using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) linked to hospitalization and vital statistics data. The CPRD is a database that contains detailed clinical record of over 19 million patients in the United Kingdom. 

Findings of this study will add to our understanding of the long-term benefits of long-acting insulins versus NPH. If long-acting insulins are found to be better in protecting patients against complications compared to NPH, clinical guidelines and policies governing their access and coverage will be changed to provide them to more patients.  In doing so, this study will improve the health of patients with T1DM in Canada and globally."
"Interactions between food security, traditional food consumption, nutrients, contaminant exposure and anemia among Canadian Inuit","['Fillion, Myriam']",['N/A'],"['Anemia', 'Ecosystem Approach To Human Health', 'Food Security', 'International Polar Year Inuit Health Survey', 'Inuit', 'Lead', 'Mercury', 'Nutrition']",92000.0,284339,"Inuit in the Canadian Arctic disproportionately experience food insecurity compared to the general Canadian population. Moreover, this food insecurity is associated with poorer nutrient status and health. The Inuit are going through a nutrition transition, reflected by a decrease in traditional foods consumption and an increase in the consumption of market foods. While traditional foods are important sources of energy, protein and nutrients, environmental contaminants (eg. heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants) have been identified in these foods and in human blood. Nutrient deficiencies and heavy metal exposure have been associated with anemia, an important public health concern among Inuit. A recent study suggested that the dietary sources of heavy metals may also be major sources of iron. This project will investigate the interactions between food security, traditional food consumption, nutrients and contaminants, as well as their impacts on anemia in the Canadian Inuit. This project will explore regional, community and household vulnerability to food insecurity, describe mercury and lead exposure and nutritional status according to the food security status, and describe the prevalence of anemia and its determinants, looking at nutrients and lead exposure. The data is from the International Polar Year Inuit Health Survey, a cross-sectional survey of Inuit adults living in the Arctic. This research will further our knowledge on the dynamics between the environmental and socio-economic determinants of food security, traditional food consumption, nutrients and contaminants exposure, and provide further knowledge on how these interrelations are associated with anemia. The results will contribute to the development of strategies to reduce food insecurity, maximize nutrient intake and minimize exposure to contaminants, in order to guide stakeholders and governments in their discussion of policies and programs to improve health in the Arctic."
Food insecurity is compounded by increased mercury and lead exposure among Inuit in the Canadian Arctic,"['Fillion, Myriam']",['N/A'],"['Ecosystem Approach To Human Health', 'Food Security', 'International Polar Year Inuit Health Survey', 'Inuit', 'Lead', 'Mercury', 'Nutrition']",1000.0,288170,"Background: Food insecurity is high in the Canadian Arctic, and related to poor nutrient status among adult Inuit. Food safety issues such as exposure to the environmental contaminants mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) is another concern but the relation between food security and contaminant exposure is unknown.

Objective: To study the relationship between exposure to Hg and Pb and food security status among Canadian Inuit adults.

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 2 595 Inuit adults from 36 communities from Inuvialuit Settlement Region, Nunavut and Nunatsiavut. Data on household composition, traditional food harvesting and consumption, socio-economic indicators was collected. Food security was assessed using the 18-item USDA questionnaire. Blood Hg (B-Hg) and Pb (B-Pb) levels were measured. ANOVA and multiple regressions were used to explore the relations between exposures and food security.

Results: B-Hg and B-Pb were higher in participants living in food insecure households and answering positively to the question ""In the last 12 months, were there times when the food for you and your family just did not last, and there was no money to buy more?"". When controlling for age, sex, smoking, drinking, country food preference and the presence of an active hunter, there was a positive association between B-Hg and B-Pb and increasing household food insecurity. 

Discussion: As food insecurity, poor nutrient status and exposure to contaminants are public health concerns in the Canadian Inuit, there is a need to understand the interdependent dynamics behind these issues in order to promote food security and safety."

The effects of sea surface temperature changes on Dengue fever in Peru,"['Findlater, Aidan R']",['N/A'],"['Epidemiology', 'Global Health', 'Infectious Disease', 'Time-Spatial Analysis']",17500.0,200332,"New and emerging diseases pose substantial risks to global population health. Even relatively small outbreaks may have significant repercussions. For example, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, infected slightly more than eight thousand people worldwide, yet the estimated cost to the Canadian economy alone was as high as CAD$2 billion.

Prevention of emerging disease outbreaks has mostly focussed on using surveillance systems to identify outbreaks before they cause damage to our health or economies. However, given that there remain gaps in all surveillance networks, a better understanding of the conditions that give rise to emerging diseases could allow public health agencies to allocate greater resources to or increase surveillance of potential hotspots. Furthermore, it may also suggest ways to mitigate outbreaks by altering the underlying conditions. These approaches have great potential for the control of emerging diseases.

Climate change is one factor that has been linked with the emergence of outbreaks and the spread of infectious diseases. In particular, the El Niño Southern Oscillation has been linked with changes in Cholera and vector-borne diseases. To further our understanding of this, we propose to investigate the relationship between changes in coastal sea surface temperature (SST) and reported Dengue fever cases. We have collected 40 years of SST data recorded at nine Peruvian marine stations along the coast. A second data set has been created that includes reports of Dengue fever cases in Peru since 1993. For this project we will focus on SST changes and reported Dengue fever cases from 2002-2007. Working with colleagues in the Departments of Geography and Biostatistics, we propose to explore relationships between changes in SSTs and changes in Dengue fever cases. Depending on the success of these analyses, the investigation will be expanded to include a longer timeframe of multiple El Niño cycles and other vector-borne diseases."
Economies of Care in Canada: Indigenous Child Wellness in the Settler State,"['Finestone, Erika']",['N/A'],"['Child Welfare', 'Customary Childcare', 'Indigenous Child And Family Wellness', 'Social Determinants Of Health']",1000.0,331173,"Despite the 1985 recognition of ""Customary Care"" (CC) as an Aboriginal right, there are more Indigenous children in out-of-home care now than at the height of the residential school period (Trocmé, Knoke, & Blackstock 2004). Though forms of community-based childcare like CC are increasingly being promoted by social workers as a best practice (Carriere-Laboucane 1997), the continued overrepresentation of Indigenous children in out-of-home care in Canada signals a need to integrate culturally grounded permanency planning into provincial child welfare service delivery programs (de Finney 2012). My doctoral research responds to this need through an ethnographic study of CC in Victoria and its surrounding First Nations. I aim to identify gaps in Western and Indigenous understandings of care that may be contributing to Indigenous child apprehension. I argue that though child apprehension is often framed as being in the ""best interests"" of Indigenous children, it fails to account for the cultural, spiritual, and psychosocial wellness of Indigenous communities as crucial considerations for healthy permanency planning (Carrière & de Finney 2015). My research will explore how the practice of child removal may actually impede upon the early childhood development of those placed in out-of-home care, with severe consequences for the long term health of Indigenous families and communities who are losing their children. My doctoral research will serve as a contribution to a growing field of knowledge emphasizing the importance of building more culturally nuanced understandings of health and wellness as it pertains to Indigenous children and families in settler states (Stevenson 2014; Simpson 2011). This knowledge can be used in the development and implementation of Indigenous child welfare policies, and service delivery models, that seek to improve the individual and community health of Indigenous peoples in Canada through more holistic and integrative permanency planning."

There is also a lack of culturally appropriate tools and methods for identifying and measuring health and social characteritics from an Indigenous perspective.  More mental health and addictions information that is based in local culture and is representative of these communities is needed.  This research project will build on a proven community-based method called Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) to get Aboriginal families to participate in a cohort study.  RDS is a unique tool because it relies on people to recruit their own peers into the study and generates unbiased population health information.  In particular, data on mental health conditions and the use of illicit drugs will provide much needed knowledge on how frequent and serious these issues are, particularly in off-reserve Aboriginal communities.  The information gathered through this research will help ongoing Aboriginal community services and program evaluations and will contribute to the overall deficiency in available public health information on Aboriginal people in Canada."
Paved with good intentions: Gentrification and the health and equity impacts of urban change,"['Firth, Caislin']",['N/A'],"['Built Environment', 'Gentrification', 'Health Equity', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Neighbourhoods', 'Urban Design']",1500.0,418142,"Urban renewal offers huge potential for improving population health in cities, but can also carry unintended consequences for health equity. While the lack of investments in disadvantaged neighbourhoods may perpetuate health inequities, so can gentrification processes. Limited evidence and ongoing debate about the definitions, perceptions, measurement, and consequences of gentrification create confusion for planners and policy makers trying to reimagine cities while optimizing health and equity. Given national interest in advancing solutions-oriented research on healthy cities and major government investments in urban infrastructure, the need to unpack the complex relationship between urban change, gentrification, and population health is a central challenge for both research and policy. 

Gentrification is of great interest to policy makers and population health researchers striving to improve urban environments while avoiding negative consequences like resident displacement. Currently, evidence on the definition, causes, and consequences of gentrification is mixed, limiting the ability of cities to maximize the health and equity benefits of urban renewal. 

This timely symposium will bring clarity to the gentrification debate by showcasing the latest research and thinking from a population health perspective. This interactive symposium will: 1) explore how diverse perspectives shape the meaning and measurement of gentrification, 2) propose a conceptual framework to illustrate how and for whom gentrification impacts health and wellbeing, and 3) engage participants in the design of a mixed-methods study to examine the mechanisms between urban interventions, gentrification, and population health. The symposium will conclude with a facilitated discussion to explore how gentrification is unfolding in Canadian cities and how urban revitalization strategies can be implemented in a way that is both impactful and equitable."

Due to increased substance abuse and injection drug use (IDU), FN populations are at a greater risk for the transmission of blood-borne viruses (BBV), such as HIV and Hepatitis C, and drug overdose. In recent years, prescription opioid (PO), and specifically Oxycontin, misuse and related harms have become a very serious and extensive problem in FN communities. In several Nishnawbe Aski Nation (NAN) communities in northern Ontario, over half of both adult and adolescent populations were estimated to be misusing Oxycontin in 2011, which led the Assembly of Chiefs to declare a public health emergency. In an attempt to reduce PO abuse across the province, the Ontario government delisted Oxycontin in March 2012.  This is very concerning given the limited treatment options for Oxycontin misusers in NAN communities and the risks for BBV transmission and drug overdose that may be further amplified by (largely undesired) effects of this policy intervention. The goal of this study is to explore changes in drug use and risk behaviours related to HIV transmission among drug users in NAN communities following the Oxycontin delisting in March 2012. Using community-based research (CBR) methods, this study will take place in 3 NAN communities with large PO misuse populations. Interviews will be conducted with regular Oxycontin users and key informants in each community. Interviews will focus on shifts in BBV risk behaviors since the delisting of Oxycontin. Results will be finalized in collaboration with all members of the project team and with community partners. Findings from the study will be provided to NAN communities and shared with key policy, program and practice stakeholders in order to improve much needed substance abuse and HIV interventions in this high-risk population."

In these contexts, several key POA control or policy interventions are currently being implemented or developed in Canada, which provide a unique and urgent opportunity to systematically assess their impacts on population. Systematically evaluating these interventions is crucial, since interventions to restrict POA-related harms and problems - e.g., by more strictly monitoring or reducing POA-use in SCP care - may result in severe 'collateral harms', e.g., by undermining or compromising SCP care availability or quality. This study will assess three current policy intervention initiatives by measuring their impact, both over-time and across jurisdictions (e.g., provinces) in Canada, on the basis of multiple data indicators and sources. The investigators will furthermore work with a group of three preeminent 'knowledge translation' collaborators from the crucially related policy fields of pain care, population health and substance use in order to develop and initiate appropriate knowledge translation of findings into these key policy and programming fields."

The current state of knowledge basically frames NMPOU users principally as another class of 'drug abusers' or 'addicts', and current impending policy development initiatives mainly focus on restricting access to prescription opioid-supported care to individuals with histories of or risk for drug abuse. Recent epidemiological evidence from general and special populations however suggests that NMPOU users - in comparison to non- or other drug users - may distinctly be characterized by important co-morbidity problems, specifically mental health disorder and pain. If these associations consistently and validly exist, these co-morbidities may crucially influence NMPOU behavior, and interventions to reduce NMPOU and related harms would need to focus on effectively addressing these co-morbidities (rather than restricting prescription opioid access or care, which may amplify rather than reduce key causes of NMPOU and related problems). On this basis, this project will conduct a series of systematic reviews to rigorously examine the hypothesized associations between NMPOU and mental health and pain, respectively. Together with a knowledge user group (KUG) of representatives from key government sectors and affected professional fields and agencies, recommendations will be developed from the research results and systematically disseminated into relevant areas of policy, programming and practice."

Multimorbidity is common in older adults and is associated with increased risk of death, poor quality of life, reduced functionality, and hospitalization.  Multimorbidity also imposes synergistic effects, increasing risks beyond those attributed to individual conditions. Studies have found that risk (variously measured) increases consistently with the number of co-occurring chronic conditions. Concerns about the differential impact of specific disease combinations and the desire to inform clinical practice has led to research on disease clusters. Research looking at disease clusters has shown that the greatest risks are not necessarily associated with the most common clusters and are often seen in clusters including mental disorders. The important role of mental health in relation to disability was also shown in a recent study which found the highest disability was associated with disease clusters that included depressive symptoms. Other studies exploring multimorbidity and disability have known limitations, including the omission of mental disorders, use of multimorbidity indices having limited clinical relevance, and inclusion of only certain age groups. Our study addresses these limitations and looks at multimorbidity in a large sample of Canadian adults age 45 and older. It explores the association between disability and multimorbidity that includes mental disorders and physical chronic conditions. Our focus on mental health and disability is supported by the evidence that the highest burden is often seen in disease clusters that include mental disorders. Moreover, the results hold promise for informing the design of the most effective interventions. A recent review showed that multimorbidity interventions targeting mental health and functional ability outperformed interventions using general multimorbidity strategies."

To date, however, evidence on risk prediction using these methods for population health applications is limited and it is unclear how AI approaches could be used to benefit health protection, promotion, prevention and health equity. The objectives of the proposed program of work are to: 1) develop an AI strategy for PHO, the host organization; 2) develop two new risk prediction models for dementia and multiple chronic disease using AI methods; and 3) support public health units in building AI capacity. It is important for Canada to build capacity for AI, as there is significant potential for these methods to support population health surveillance and disease prevention."

Quebec, for example, recently revisited this issue with its own Select Committee on Dying with Dignity in 2009-2010. There are five medical practices in end-of-life care that remain ethically controversial among various stakeholders that include bioethicists, health care providers, policy makers, and individuals from vulnerable and marginalized communities. These practices are: withholding of treatment, withdrawal of treatment, terminal sedation, euthanasia, and physician-assisted suicide. The fact that various governments continue to repeatedly consult the public on these issues suggests that we still lack a comprehensive understanding of Canadians' moral beliefs on these practices and the values that underpin those beliefs. This lack of understanding has resulted in discrepant, and at times contested, end-of-life treatment and policies throughout Canada, creating ethical dilemmas for various stakeholders and undermining the accessibility provision of Canada Health Act. This three-year research project is designed: 1) to describe and analyse the diverse moral beliefs of Canadians through an examination of media reporting of these issues from 1995 to present; 2) to gain an ethical understanding of key stakeholders' reasons for holding particular positions on these issues through in-depth interviews; 3) to present a comprehensive analysis of these issues to policy makers so that they may engage the public more effectively in the future. We are a team of social scientists and bioethicists trained and knowledgeable in end-of-life care issues and qualitative research methods. Our analysis will inform the development of meaningful end-of-life care policy for Canadians and contribute to improving clinical end-of-life care for patients."

Because people with Chlamydia often don't know they have it, people get tested for this infection and treated if they test positive.  However, even though testing programs have grown greatly over the past 20 years, Chlamydia rates still seem to be going up, rather than down.  This increase could be real (and related to unexpected effects of antibiotic treatment, or changes in behaviour), or it could simply be a result of us finding more infections because we're looking for them.  We propose to analyze information on Chlamydia reports, laboratory testing rates, and rates of Chlamydia complications, in order to figure out whether or not rates of Chlamydia infection are truly rising in three major Ontario jurisdictions: Hamilton, Toronto, and York Region.  If they are truly rising, we will try to find out why using statistical models.  We will also use this information to create mathematical simulations that can be used to better understand how Chlamydia is being spread, and to pinpoint the best and most efficient ways to reduce the spread of Chlamydia, using the limited health resources at our disposal."

The conference will be held at Western University, is national in scope as per the CCAA's mandate, and will host up to 200 delegates over two days. The first day will offer a selection of theory and practical workshops, disseminating current research evidence on effective physical activity programming for older adults. A keynote address is delivered by either a leading researcher in the field or a motivational speaker. We are awaiting confirmation from Dr. Mike Evans of the University of Toronto, who created 23 ½ hours, a ground-breaking video about the single best thing we can do for our health. Presentations from physical activity and aging experts/practitioners will share their work over the course of the day, including the PhD student who wins the request for proposals to share their research. The second day of the conference will begin with a panel of older adults speaking to how exercise has improved their lives. Subsequent activities will focus on the practical application of the research knowledge shared on day one. Successful and evidence-based programs will be showcased and participants will learn through experiential and interactive opportunities. Conference participants will represent Canada and include CCAA course trainers and facilitators, fitness instructors, other fitness-related practitioners, policy-makers, students, and individuals from public and private organizations, as well as older adults interested in physical activity and health promotion.  This event will provide opportunities for delegates to network during the course of the conference and build relationships that will extend beyond the two-day conference.  It is expected that over 175 delegates from across Canada will attend."
Baseline Emotion Regulatory Capacity and Dialectical Behaviour Therapy Skills Training in Borderline Personality Disorder: A Multi-Method Investigation,"['Fitzpatrick, Skye S']",['N/A'],"['Borderline Personality Disorder', 'Dialectical Behaviour Therapy', 'Emotion Regulation', 'Psychophysiology', 'Self-Injury', 'Suicide']",105000.0,283911,"Suicide and self-injury are serious issues in Canada, and rates of suicidal behaviours are disproportionately high in Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). BPD involves instability of self-image, relationships, emotions, behaviour, and cognitions. There is clear need to effectively treat, and reduce the suicidal behaviours, in BPD. Individuals with BPD display difficulties with emotion regulation, and suicidal or self-injurious behaviour in BPD is conceptualized as an attempt to regulate emotions. Effective treatments for BPD such as Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) focus on increasing healthy emotion regulation. However, these therapies are long (i.e., at least one year) and labour-intensive (i.e., involve both individual and group therapy components). Canadians would thus benefit from research examining the individual characteristics that render those with BPD as more or less likely to benefit from a shortened, group-therapy only version of DBT (i.e., 20-week DBT skills groups). The proposed study will collaborate with an ongoing study at the Centre for Addictions and Mental Health (CAMH) assessing the effectiveness of a 20-week DBT skills group (as an adjunct to treatment as usual) compared to a waitlist control in the treatment of chronically suicidal and non-suicidal self-injurious behaviours in BPD individuals. The proposed study will examine whether baseline difficulties with emotion regulation (i.e., decreased ability to change or regulate emotional responses as indicated by self-report and bodily changes in an experimental task) predict the reduction of suicidal and self-injurious behaviours in BPD individuals in a 20-week DBT skills group. The findings in the proposed study will indicate if baseline difficulties with emotion regulation can be used to select effective and efficient treatments for some individuals with BPD, thereby reducing the burden of long and labour-intensive treatments for patients, health care providers, and Canadian taxpayers."
CIHR III Spring 2024 New Investigator Forum,"['Fitzpatrick, Tiffany']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1125.0,492599,"My research program focuses on the epidemiology and equitable prevention of viral respiratory diseases at a population-level. Particularly, my research primarily seeks to inform policies and programs aiming to equitably prevent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in childhood. Upon completing my PhD in Epidemiology (Specialization: Public Health Policy) in 2020, I undertook two postdoctoral fellowships - one focused on the spatial modelling of RSV at the Yale School of Public Health Public Health Modeling Unit and a second on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines with the Canadian Center for Vaccinology. In summer 2022, I transitioned into an independent research position, as a Scientist with Public Health Ontario with a status-only faculty appointment at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health. Through this position, I have been able to begin to develop an independent program of research in the area of viral respiratory disease prevention, with the aim of providing relevant information for decision-making (e.g., emerging RSV prophylaxis and vaccine products, healthcare capacity planning). My interests are highly relevant with III's four strategic goals as I am driven to support vaccine-preventable disease research which is relevant for decision-making, policy, and practice; in addition to regularly negaging policy makers, program planners, and clinicians, my current work examining the acceptablity of emerging RSV vaccine products has also sought to directly include partnerships with parents and community members from higher risk communities (e.g., Inuit communities in Nunavut). Moreover, my research program spans multiple disciplines, leverages a social determinants of health and health equity lens, and incorporates novel methodologies (e.g., advanced statistical and mathematical models)."
Does early-life respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection increase the risk of asthma? Using population-based health administrative data to address two missing pieces of the puzzle,"['Fitzpatrick, Tiffany', 'Buchan, Sarah', 'Fell, Deshayne B']","['Dimitris, Michelle C', 'Hawken, Steven', 'Kwong, Jeffrey C', 'McNally, James D']","['Asthma', 'Child Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus']",74971.0,470839,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of respiratory illness among children <5 years, annually causing >33 million respiratory infection episodes and 3 million hospitalizations globally. While ubiquitous to childhood-infecting nearly all children by 3 years of age-no RSV vaccine currently exists. Multiple promising candidates are under development; however, Palivizumab is the only option currently available for RSV prophylaxis, which has stringent eligibility criteria due to its high cost and monthly dosing requirements (i.e., only infants at high-risk of severe disease are eligible).
In addition to its acute impacts, early-life RSV illness has been repeatedly shown to be followed by increased risk of chronic respiratory conditions in childhood, such as recurrent wheeze and asthma. 

Challenges in determining the causal role of RSV in these pathways has limited our ability to disentangle two prevailing theories: (1) RSV infection and asthma share common causes (e.g. atopic predisposition); and (2) severe RSV infection causes asthma (via altered airway and immune responses). A clearer understanding of the long-term health sequalae of RSV, including asthma, is crucial to informing cost-effectiveness and effectiveness studies evaluating emerging RSV vaccine and long-acting prophylaxis candidates.

Building upon our study team's earlier work in these areas, our proposal seeks to address two missing pieces in the RSV-asthma causality puzzle by providing: 1. an estimate of the effectiveness of Palivizumab programs in decreasing asthma incidence; and 2. a precise, population-based quantification of the risk of asthma due to severe early-life RSV illness, compared to siblings without an early-life history of severe RSV, to account for complex gene-environment factors."

Youth want both sides of the story presented to them in an unbiased manner to make informed decisions about using cannabis and other substances. When youth are engaged in meaningful discussions about cannabis they are more informed, which can support them in their decisions-making. We are proposing the development and dissemination of a knowledge mobilization tool based on these research findings. This tool will be in the form of a Canadian Cannabis Talk Guide and will educate and inform those serving youth how to have protective, unbiased, informed and non-judgmental conversations with youth about cannabis. It will also provide accurate information on the substance to inform their decision-making process. We will work with Canadian youth and youth allies to develop the tool, tailor the messages and ensure dissemination mediums are appropriate to reach our intended audiences."
"Exploring Experiences with HIV/AIDS, Addiction Services and Research among Urban Aboriginal People Who Use Drugs in British Columbia","['Fleming, Kim']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal', 'Addiction Services', 'Community-Based', 'Health', 'Hiv Prevention And Treatment', 'Illicit Drug Use', 'Qualitative', 'Research']",17500.0,289300,"The HIV/AIDS epidemic continues to be significantly impacted by illicit drug use. In Vancouver, recent studies have shown that Aboriginal people who use drugs (APWUD) experience higher rates of HIV infection and poorer HIV treatment outcomes. APWUD are less likely to access HIV-focused prevention and treatment programs and addiction treatment services. In comparison to other British Columbians living with HIV/AIDS, individuals of Aboriginal ancestry are also more likely to die of HIV-related causes without ever having received antiretroviral therapy. Although these gaps have been well documented, the individual successes, strengths and barriers, related to HIV and addiction service access among APWUD have not been thoroughly investigated. In addition, though APWUD experience elevated HIV infection rates, they report lower rates of HIV-related risk behaviours. It appears therefore, that current research methods are failing APWUD, and there is a need for new community-based research (CBR) approaches and action focused on HIV/AIDS and specific to APWUD.

The Western Aboriginal Harm Reduction Society (WAHRS), created in 2002, is a grassroots organization run by APWUD. WAHRS seeks to celebrate their inherent strengths as indigenous peoples, recover a holistic traditional philosophy, create sound communities, develop networks and coalitions, and improve the quality of life for people who are Aboriginal and use illicit drugs. WAHRS has a longstanding partnership with the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS (BC CfE). Together, through this proposal, we aim to explore the strengths and barriers to HIV and addictions services for APWUD and uncover means to develop culturally safe and relevant community-based responses to HIV and illicit drug use."
Place and home among people living with HIV who use drugs: A qualitative study,"['Fleming, Taylor']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2500.0,400480,"Research shows that sense-of-home can influence health of people living with HIV (PLHIV). However, impacts of home-making on HIV treatment among marginally-housed PLHIV who use drugs are poorly understood. We examined this relationship in Vancouver, Canada. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 31 PLHIV who use drugs, focusing on housing conditions, drug use, and HIV management. Interviews were analyzed thematically and interpreted by drawing on concepts of home. Ability to control housing environments contributed to perceptions of home by fostering feelings of safety and allowing for creation of personalized space. Participants identified the importance of housing stability and quality in maintaining health, including HIV care. However, negative experiences of home, informed by structural-level factors that undermined autonomy, negatively impacted treatment adherence. Findings indicate that sense of place may enable ability to manage HIV care, and is promoted through feelings of security within, and control over, housing environments."
Social-structural influences on access and adherence to antiretroviral therapy among people living with HIV/AIDS who use drugs: A qualitative meta-synthesis,"['Fleming, Taylor']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2500.0,382927,"Social and structural factors such as drug law enforcement and economic marginalization have previously been identified as critical determinants of access and adherence to HIV treatment among people living with HIV (PLHIV) who use drugs. This qualitative meta-synthesis aims to better understand the ways in which these social and structural forces intersect to impact HIV treatment access and adherence globally for PLHIV who use drugs. We conducted a systematic literature search of peer-reviewed qualitative literature on HIV treatment and access among PLHIV who use drugs. To be included in this meta-synthesis articles must focus on HIV treatment and access, include a sample >50% of PLHIV who use drugs, and have been published since 1998. A total of 33 articles met this inclusion criteria, and were analyzed by three team members. Our analysis found that access and adherence to HIV treatment are negatively impacted by: (1) drug criminalization and resulting law enforcement strategies (e.g. policing near clinics); (2) interpersonal stigma associated with drug use that undermined doctor-patient relationships; and (3) structural vulnerabilities (e.g. homelessness, incarceration) acting as barriers to treatment. These findings demonstrate that complementary drug policy reforms (e.g., drug decriminalization) and structural interventions (e.g., expansion of social housing) are necessary to optimize HIV-treatment outcomes among PLHIV who use drugs. These complementary approaches may prove necessary to achieve 90-90-90 targets among PLHIV who use drugs."
Responding ethically and effectively to overdose risk environments in low-income housing: A community-based participatory research study,"['Fleming, Taylor']",['N/A'],"['Ethnographic Observation', 'Harm Reduction', 'Overdose Prevention', 'Qualitative Methods']",105000.0,404146,"North America is in the midst of a growing overdose crisis, inciting declarations of public health emergencies across the continent. The overdose crisis, which can primarily be attributed to the proliferation of fentanyl and related analogues, has been particularly severe in British Columbia, Canada, where four people die each day of overdose, and 87% of overdose deaths occur in housing. In response, innovative housing-based interventions are being implemented in housing environments, although research to date has yet to examine the ways in which housing environments act as overdose risk environments, and the role of such emerging housing-based interventions to address risk of overdose. The project I am requesting funding for will employ the principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR) to address this research gap. Through qualitative interviews, ethnographic fieldwork, and meaningful engagement of the community through collaboration with drug-user organization my proposed research project will address the following objectives: (1) To examine how contextual forces in housing environments shape high-risk injection practices; (2) To examine the implementation and impact of housing-based harm reduction interventions; and (3) To document innovative approaches to employing CBPR methods during a public health emergency. This research will generate urgently needed evidence to better inform policies and interventions to address the overdose crisis in BC and across North America, and will further understanding of housing as an overdose risk environment."
Understanding polysubstance use and overdose risk: Harnessing community-based and ethnographic approaches to advance health equity for people experiencing homelessness,"['Fleming, Taylor']",['N/A'],"['Drug Use', 'Ethnography', 'Housing And Homelessness', 'Qualitative Research', 'Urban Health']",100000.0,493074,"Most overdose deaths in cities now involve fentanyl-stimulant co-use, and people experiencing homelessness among those most impacted. In San Francisco, rising overdose rates have catalyzed expansions to harm reduction and drug treatment services. However, there have also been sharp increases in street-based homelessness which have been met with responses (e.g., mass displacement, increased policing) with potential to deepen health inequities. This creates a paradox that research has yet to reconcile; public health is trying to adapt to the new challenges of polysubstance-related harms, yet efforts may be undermined in the current climate towards street-based homelessness. To address this gap, this project will examine fentanyl-stimulant co- use patterns among people experiencing street-based homelessness and situate these dynamics against evolving street-based homelessness responses to better understand polysubstance-involved overdose outcomes. For this ethnographic study, I will conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with 60 people experiencing street-based homelessness who co-use fentanyl and stimulants. I will complete ethnographic fieldwork (150-200 hrs) including observation at recruitment sites and longitudinal ethnographic observation (n=20). Local stakeholders with relevant expertise will inform sampling decisions and advise on recruitment sites. I will also conduct interviews with 15 stakeholders (e.g., housing advocates, service providers) with local drug use and housing expertise. I will draw on critical and intersectional approaches to consider how vulnerabilities to harms are differentially produced. Addressing this research gap is critical to optimize responses to the overdose crisis and mitigate risks associated with polysubstance use and homelessness. Through strategic stakeholder engagement, the evidence generated from this project will be used to develop recommendations that are scalable and adaptable to other North American cities."

The health of the Montreal Inuit does not exist in isolation but is a product of complex interactions between northern and southern communities, lifestyles, and social determinants. The proposed mixed-methods study will survey the Inuit population of Montreal, undertake a population health survey with a segment of the population, and characterize the social, political and cultural contexts in which health is manifested. 

The proposed project will provide a separate yet parallel study to the upcoming Qanuilirpitaa 2017 (Q2017) regional health survey in Nunavik. Q2017 will provide the most comprehensive overview of Inuit physical, mental, social and community health ever undertaken. The survey is lead by Inuit regional health organizations in partnership with government agencies, community and university partners and will be undertaken in the 14 communities of Nunavik. For a variety of jurisdictional reasons, the urban Inuit population is excluded from the research design of Q2017. The proposed survey will address this gap. The tools used will be a modified selection of those used in Q2017. This project is thus complementary to Q2017 and involves many of the same partners and academic contributors. In undertaking this research we intend to better understand Inuit health in all Quebec and foster action to reduce disparities.

Our research team has established projects and working relationships with clinicians, service providers, community leaders and Inuit organizations in the North and South, all of whom will work as partners to develop an action research agenda grounded in the results of the survey."

(2) To explore digital storytelling as a strategy for increasing Aboriginal youth activism in HIV prevention. (3) To develop and disseminate community-specific ""by youth for youth"" HIV prevention and support materials. 

METHODS: Stage 1: We will invite Aboriginal youth from across Canada to apply to ""tell their stories"" about HIV leadership, activism and engagement. We will select youth (n=20; ages 16-25) to ensure representation from all regions of the country. These youth will be welcomed to a week-long workshop at which they will be taught digital story-telling skills and provided assistance to create short (3-5 minute) films that tell their unique stories (in their own words and languages) about how and why they became involved and engaged in HIV prevention.   Following the creation of these stories, each youth will be interviewed about their film and why they became HIV leaders and activists. Stage 2: Each youth leader/film maker will be asked to organize a screening of their film in their own community with other youth, elders and community members. Following the film, a facilitated discussion will ensue about the impact of HIV on Aboriginal communities, why it is so difficult to talk about, and what might inspire others to become leaders. 

ANALYSIS: We will analyze all of the digital stories collected, and all of the interviews and facilitated discussions. 

DISSEMINATION: In addition to disseminating findings through traditional academic media, youth productions will also be shared online. We will create community-friendly packages with a copy of the DVD that has all the stories, a manual and a discussion guide for others seeking to screen the stories."

(3) Are there differential impacts related to gender, sexuality, Indigeneity, newcomer status or race? (4) In what ways could the resource and outreach activities be enhanced to (even) better reach target audiences and amplify impacts? We will partner with our established youth advisory, peer researchers and community partners across Canada to gather date from: (a) 1000 youth users of the Sexfluent website through an online survey to learn more about who access the site, how they found it, their feedback, its potential impact on behaviors and recruit participants for in-depth focus group discussions and (b) 80 young people through 8 targeted focus groups with priority youth populations. Focus groups will use fun and interactive activities to orient youth to the website and its features and query around its relevance and potential for diverse groups. Peer researchers will be involved in all aspects of the study including refining data collection instruments, gathering data, analysis and KTE. Results will be used to enhance Sexfluent programming. They will be shared widely to improve online HIV and STBBI outreach across Canada and around the world."
Les trajectoires addictives et d'utilisation de services: l'expérience des hommes ayant des relations sexuelles avec d'autres hommes (HARSAH).,"['Flores-Aranda, Jorge M']",['N/A'],"['Comportements', 'Harsah', 'Recherche Communautaire', 'Services De Santé', 'Toxicomanie', 'Vih']",70000.0,223961,"Les hommes ayant des relations sexuelles avec d'autres hommes (HARSAH) consommeraient davantage de substances que leurs pairs hétérosexuels et leur consommation aurait augmenté au cours des dernières années. La consommation abusive de substances dans cette population semble associée à certains déterminants liés à leur vécu homosexuel, notamment: la difficulté d'acceptation de son orientation sexuelle, le vécu de la discrimination, l'importante présence d'alcool et de drogues dans plusieurs endroits de socialisation gais, etc. Le statut sérologique semble être un autre déterminant de la consommation problématique, qui est plus importante chez les HARSAH séropositifs. De plus, les HARSAH initieraient des thérapies en toxicomanie plus tardivement que les hommes hétérosexuels et ces thérapies ne seraient pas toujours adaptées à leur contexte de consommation, à leurs expériences de vie, ou à leur statut sérologique. En outre, on sait que les prévalences du VIH chez les HARSAH au Canada et à Montréal seraient respectivement de 15,3% et de 12,5% et que la consommation de drogues serait associée à certains comportements sexuels à risque. En raison de ces nombreux enjeux, cette recherche vise à: 1) Décrire l'expérience au cours de la trajectoire addictive des HARSAH et comprendre comment celle ci s'inscrit dans leur vécu homosexuel; 2) Identifier les besoins de santé spécifiques découlant de cette interaction (addiction/vécu homosexuel), notamment en rapport avec le VIH; 3) Documenter l'expérience des HARASH, séropositifs et séronégatifs, en rapport avec leur utilisation des services et examiner dans quelle mesure les services répondent à leurs besoins de leur point de vue. En plus de l'avancement au plan des connaissances, ce projet permettra d'obtenir des données scientifiques sur la trajectoire de consommation problématique de substances des HARSAH afin de développer ou d'adapter des interventions appropriées."

Cela peut s'expliquer, entre autres, par le fait que certains HARSAH consomment de substances psychoactives dans un contexte sexuel. Ce contexte de consommation peut les amener à avoir un double risque d'infection : pratiques sexuelles non sécuritaires et pratiques de consommation pouvant faciliter la transmission d'infections. D'autres groupes populationnels vivent également cette problématique. Conscients de cette situation, plusieurs chercheurs et acteurs communautaires ont mis en place des interventions novatrices pour rejoindre ces populations, notamment des interventions en ligne. Jusqu'à maintenant, les quelques études qui ont évalué l'efficacité de ces types d'intervention observent des diminutions soit de la consommation, soit des conduites à risque. Or, peu d'études se sont penchées particulièrement sur les HARSAH et une seule a évalué à la fois l'effet des interventions en ligne sur la consommation et sur les conduites sexuelles.

Most injuries are known to display distinct patterns so are believed to be potentially predictable and preventable. In the case of intentional injures, i.e., suicidal behaviour, maltreatment or abuse injuries, as opposed to unintentional injuries, i.e., exercise injuries, the prediction of such patterns is not as straightforward and cannot be addressed by a single-cause based solution in the same way that cycling head injuries can be prevented by wearing a cycling helmet. Intentional injuries turn on more intrapsychic and interpersonal matters that are multiply determined so they are not amenable to a single-cause based solution. This study will add an attachment style behavioural measure -a measure that provides a sample of the injured children's daily relational context, to a linguistic factor set identified in an earlier study -factors that are believed to be intrinsically linked with the mental representation of an injury event, to assist primary care physicians in their determination of injury intent as they assess bodily damage. The goal of this study is to inform intentional injury prevention and intervention efforts as psychological injuries can often outlast physical injuries, and in some cases significant psychological sequelae can have a pervasive and ongoing deleterious impact on children's attachment style, development, wellbeing, self-regulation, and social competence, and can also include the intergenerational transmission of interpersonal aggression and abuse."

In the case of intentional injures, as opposed to unintentional injuries, the prediction of such patterns is not as straightforward. Intentional injuries turn on more intrapsychic and interpersonal matters. To address this difference, data was drawn from the Canadian Hospitals Injury Reporting and Prevention Program to identify whether intentional and unintentional injuries were reported differently. A pilot-project involving children who were injured in 2004, and whose injuries led to a hospital visit, successfully identified category differentiating linguistic indicators. A subsequent analysis extended the pilot's findings with 2001 to 2003 data and included data on: a) the effectiveness of an evolving glossary of injury event linguistic indicators associated with the standard hospital injury intent codes; b) an inter-rater reliability check that helped identify that raters blind to the hospital intent code can sort injury cases into matching categories; and c) a factor analysis of the linguistic indicators per injury type. This poster will broaden the earlier findings by including data from an exploratory behavioural analysis that includes a preliminary categorical inventory of the proxemics observed between the injured child and the concerned other (parent or caregiver)."

Communities and northern health systems will have to adapt. The research team assembled here has been working with Inuit communities and policy makers for over a decade, examining what climate change means for health. This has recently included the identification and prioritization of potential adaptation interventions. Here we plan to take the next step and develop, implement, and evaluate pilot interventions in case study communities. Specifically, the project will examine how to document, preserve, and promote Inuit traditional knowledge (IK) for adapting to the health effects of climate change. Previous research has indicated the importance of IK for managing the health effects of climate change, yet there is widespread concern that this knowledge is being lost as elders pass away. 
The project will begin by identifying and characterizing how IK can help enhance health in-light of a rapidly changing climate. Working with 6 communities, the research will document IK on health prevention, preparedness, and promotion, with attention directed to maintaining physical, mental, and social well-being in-light of a rapidly changing climate. Secondly, we will explore ways to preserve, promote, and make accessible this knowledge for adaptation to climate change. Potential tools and platforms for doing this will be identified in collaboration with communities and may involve web-based knowledge banks, radio dramas, social media, and digital storytelling. Knowledge promotion interventions will be implemented and promoted and will be evaluated using a number of methods including before and after surveys, and focus groups and interviews to explore the success of messaging. The project will finish by examining the extent to which promotion of traditional approaches could form part of territorial and federal adaptation programming."
A systematic mixed-methods literature review and policy analysis examining if and how the Canadian public health system is adapting to climate change,"['Ford, James D', 'Ogden, Nicholas H', 'Berrang Ford, Lea']","['Berry, Peter D', 'Heymann, Sally J', 'Kosatsky, Tom']","['Climate Change Adaptation', 'Climate Change Impacts On Health', 'Emerging Health Risks', 'Participatory Research', 'Policy Analysis', 'Systematic Literature Review']",100000.0,193057,"It is now beyond scientific doubt - Canada's climate is changing and we can expect some of the most dramatic changes globally to occur here in Canada. Many health outcomes are climate sensitive, and climate change will thus have implications for the health of Canadians. Warmer temperatures, for example, will increase heat related deaths among vulnerable populations, create conditions for the spread of vector borne diseases - including Lyme disease and even the re-emergence of malaria - and increase the incidence of food and waterborne diseases. Health studies also highlight the likelihood of increased morbidity and mortality related to a more frequent occurrence of extreme weather events (including heavy rainfall and freezing rain). So, what can Canada do to be better prepared for climate change impacts, many of which are now inevitable? One way is through adaptation, which involves public health systems intervening to prevent, reduce, and manage climate-related health risks. Adaptation initiatives are likely to be already occurring as part of regular health programming at federal, provincial / territorial, and municipal levels. However, we have little idea of what actions are being undertaken across Canada, where they are being undertaken, what they involve, what is limiting action of adaptation, or even if adaptations are addressing the risks which scientists view as most important. This project is working with decision makers at multiple levels of public health to address this knowledge deficit. By identifying, reviewing, and synthesizing what we know about climate change adaptation in the public health sector, our work is directly feeding into planning initiatives to improve and develop adaptation planning. Ultimately - as a number of high profile international assessments have highlighted - the strength of our economies and the health of our populations depending on acting now on adaptation."

The global response to the risks posed has been to focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This is imperative yet the science shows that we will not be able to avoid climate change, with the World Health Organization estimating that the direct health impacts alone will cost $2-4bn/yr by 2030 globally. For this reason, finding ways to adapt our health systems and behavior to reduce the risks of climate change is imperative, and is reflected in the increasing urgency with which governments at various levels in Canada and internationally are beginning to prioritize adaptation. 
   Yet what can we do to adapt? How can we reduce the risks posed by climate change? What evidence is there on what will work? Unfortunately we have few answers to these questions, particularly for Indigenous populations including Canada's Inuit who are living in a region experiencing the most dramatic climate change anywhere. Indeed, the health community has long neglected climate change as a risk and is only beginning to recognize the magnitude of the problem. Canadian research is at the vanguard of such developments, and Dr Ford's team have spent over a decade working with Indigenous communities examining the risks posed by climate change to health and identifying risk factors. The project proposed here will take this to the next step, evaluating specific interventions for reducing the health impacts of climate change for 4 Indigenous populations: Inuit of Canada, Shawi & Shipibo in the Amazon, and Batwa of Central Africa. The project builds upon ongoing research projects held by Dr Ford from the IDRC & tri-councils, has strong buy-in at multiple levels of health governance, and will work with decision maker partners to systematically and rigorous evaluate and prioritize potential health adaptations."
Nutritional Supplement Use by Older Adults with Complex Medication Needs; Potential for Adverse Drug-Nutrient Interactions.,"['Ford, Katherine L']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,364884,"As I am applying for the Summer Program In Aging, I will not be presenting my research but I have provided, below, an abstract of my current research as it relates to aging. 

Nutritional supplements have been available to consumers for decades but have become increasingly popular in recent years. When used in appropriate quantities, supplements can improve nutritional status; although, one concern for supplement use is the possibility of adverse medication-supplement interactions. This is especially concerning in populations who have higher medication usage, such as adults over the age of 50. Few studies of medication use in older adults assessed the impact of dietary supplement use on medication functionality and overall nutrition status and there is no significant research into the specifics of potentially adverse supplement-medication interactions. The Medication Assessment Centre (MAC) at the University of Saskatoon is a unique and evolving centre that offers in-depth medication assessments for clients. The purpose of this research project is to assess nutritional supplement use and dietary intakes of older adults with complex medication use. More specifically, investigate the potential for adverse medication-supplement interactions and develop a clinical tool (protein calculator) that will screen for poor intake of dietary protein. This study will be done in two parts. Part 1 will be development of a protein calculator tool. In Part 2, patients with chronic medication use will be assessed for dietary intakes and dietary supplement use. Currently, there are limited resources available in Canada to calculate protein intake. A 'protein calculator' will offer awareness and improved nutritional status and can result in less adverse medication-supplement interactions."

This expertise is particularly important in chronic diseases such as organ failure and organ transplantation where illness is part of patients' and caregivers' lives. In recent years, the importance of involving patients and caregivers in healthcare services has been increasingly recognized because it increases patients' sense of empowerment and adherence to treatment and also allows healthcare providers to offer services that are relevant to their patients. Engaging patients is not only important in medical care, but also in research. Indeed, engaging patients in setting research priorities increases the relevance and the quality of research, facilitates recruitment, enhances public trust and allows a better dissemination of results.

The Canadian National Transplant Research Program (CNTRP) is a multidisciplinary research team looking at different issues related to organ and tissue donation and transplantation. In order to pursue research projects that are relevant for the Canadian transplant community (patients, caregivers, donors, researchers), it is of paramount importance to involve different stakeholders in setting the future research priorities of the CNTRP. The aims of this project are to(i) identify the future research priorities for the CNTRP, via a survey and a national workshop involving patients, caregivers, healthcare professionals and researchers, and (ii) set the groundwork for involving patients at the different stages of the research process in the future."

In Canada, the federal government reaffirmed at the outset of the pandemic that abortion care is an essential health service. As a result, a number of facilities around the country adopted new and innovative models of abortion service delivery, including telemedicine services and no-touch/no-test protocols, to reduce the risk of COVID-19 exposure while maintaining the availability of care. However, other facilities and clinicians were unable to provide continuous care. The economic and social disruptions caused by the pandemic also influenced pregnant people's decision-making and timely access to abortion services. Drawing from health services data, case studies with providers, and interviews with people who sought or obtained an abortion, our goal is to document the impact of COVID-19 on abortion care in Canada, identify innovations in service delivery, and explore how racism, colonialism, and linguistic hierarchies shaped access to care, reflected and/or perpetuated health disparities, and inspired resilience. In partnership with clinicians and advocates, this mixed-methods initiative aims to promote access to equitable and high-quality abortion services during the ongoing pandemic as well as help ensure the continued availability of abortion care in the face of future public health emergencies."

However, the tobacco industry also spends several billions of dollars each year trying to make smoking seem more appealing and socially acceptable. Findings from social psychology research identifies several biases that are susceptible to be manipulated by the tobacco industry advertising. These biases have been demonstrated to have a distorting effect on people's decisions in other behavioural domains. This project examines whether the decision to smoke is entirely rational, or whether other forces distort the perceptions on which the decision to smoke is made. Drawing concepts from social psychology, we will examine the role that unrealistic optimism and emotional associations have on risk perceptions. A causal model of those influences on smoking behaviour is proposed."

Children living with HIV experience stigma among their peers at school. Previous research with this population in Uganda showed that stigma comes in the form of verbal and physical abuse from teachers and peers (bullying), leading to social isolation, school drop-out, depression and feelings of suicide. Little information is known about how to reduce this HIV-related stigma. Efforts to help these stigmatized children to live a healthy and vibrant life are of tremendous importance. Our proposed study addresses the need to reduce stigma in school-going (10-18 years) children by utilizing an arts-based program in twelve rural schools in the Omoro District of Northern Uganda (Acholi people). Traditional Northern Ugandan storytelling, proverbs, and songs whose messages and moral teachings demonstrate what society expects of children and transfer these teachings from Elder to child, form the foundation of the arts-based intervention. These traditional activities will help to instill the Acholi's long-held values and beliefs that promote peace and conflict resolution. Additionally, this intervention will create an opportunity to revitalize and sustain intergenerational knowledge transfer that has been diminished due to the impact of the civil war. Utilizing traditional knowledge as an arts-based program could provide an effective context-specific intervention to improve knowledge, attitudes, and behaviour of these children as well as a strategy to change policy at the school level and impact the broader community."

My research program aims to create spaces and places for Indigenous voice and knowledge to guide data collection, storage and use in health research, and to ensure Indigenous people receive high quality healthcare. As a First Nations woman, my program of research is grounded by Indigenous world views and driven by a desire to close health equity and healthcare quality gaps among Indigenous people in Canada. I have planned four related projects that will take place within research centres of excellence at the Rady Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Manitoba: 

1) I will build on past qualitative research with Indigenous people where I spoke with them about Manitoba's plan to collect race, ethnicity, and Indigenous identifier (REI) data in the healthcare system. Now that the plan is being put into action, I will ask about their experiences and impacts of having REI data collected. 
2) I will work with researchers using the REI datasets and other data housed in the Manitoba Population Research Data Repository. I will bring Indigenous voices and views to the way the data are used in research and find ways to minimize biases associated with them.
3) I will develop a national network of Indigenous researchers who are studying data governance and data sovereignty to exchange new knowledge.
4) I will work with clinicians and researchers to use and evaluate the Indigenous Healthcare Quality Framework I previously designed. This framework centres Indigenous patients and caregivers, and emphasizes communication through all aspects of the health system and healthcare experiences.

Through this work, I aim to highlight health inequities, disrupt racism, and improve health and healthcare quality for Indigenous people."
ADHD In a Nutshell,"['Francisco, Ana P']",['N/A'],"['Adhd', 'Information', 'Psychoeducation']",750.0,414004,"Media can be a powerful tool for educational information. Our video aims to present evidence-based information about Attentional-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder, also known as ADHD, in a format that will be easily accessible to the public. Between 5 to 11% of children and adolescents will suffer from ADHD. Disseminating more information about this disorder it is a powerful educational tool. If a child/adolescent, or even their parents, are able to understand and explain their symptoms, it may be easier to deal with the day-to-day challenges that arise when living with ADHD.  
The goal of this video is to demonstrate that ADHD is not just related to inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity but it is also related to additional deficits including problems with emotional regulation, organization skills, and attention regulation. Moreover, we would like to clarify what ADHD is not. Once parents and teachers understand that it is not an intentional behavior issue, they may manage better the ADHD symptoms. 
ADHD symptoms can cause difficulties at school, at home, and with friends. There is also an increased risk of developing depression and anxiety during life. Parent's and teachers' comprehension can be very important for the child or adolescent that has ADHD, making their ambient healthier. A higher understanding of ADHD may not only increase awareness about this disorder, but may help with earlier diagnosis and treatment, and more rapid improvement in symptoms. Also, earlier treatments can prevent escalation of problems and negative consequences, which can have a positive effect not only for the children and youth life but also in their families' life. In summary, knowing more about ADHD can be helpful for children, youth and families."
Using symbols to communicate nutrition and health claims on pre-packaged foods Canada: Examination of current practices to monitor and inform policy,"['Franco Arellano, Beatriz']",['N/A'],"['Applications In Claims Regulation And Public Health', 'Branded Food Product Database', 'Food Environments', 'Food Supply', 'Health Claims', 'Nutrition', 'Nutrition Claims', 'Nutrition Marketing', 'Nutritional Quality', 'Symbols And Pictorial Claims']",105000.0,365477,"With increasing rates of diet-related diseases, such as obesity and diabetes, food labelling (particularly nutrition claims, which are statements that suggest or imply that a food has particular nutritional properties) has become a public health strategy enabling consumers to make healthier foods choices. In Canada, mandatory nutrition labelling on pre-packaged products was passed in 2003. Although food labelling legislation around nutrition claims provides clearly defined wording, which also applies to the use of images, it is not yet well understood how symbols may nudge consumers. The main aim of this work is further understand how often symbolic nutrition claims are used in the Canadian food supply, if they are providing consumers with reliable information regarding the nutritional quality of foods, and if these claims (as words or symbols) are helping consumers to make healthier food choices. This research specifically will: 1. quantify trends in nutrition marketing and claims on pre-packaged foods sold in Canada within a three and seven-year period when compared to the 2010 baseline; 2. assess the 'healthfulness' of foods carrying claims as symbols or text format; 3. evaluate the use of these claims and the performance of Canadian labelling regulations governing the use of nutrition claims when compared to international best practices; and 4. evaluate the impact of symbolic claims on consumers' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. This study takes an innovative, comprehensive, global and national approach to demonstrate the level of consumers' exposure to symbolic nutrition and health claims, the nutritional quality of food with claims, and will identify gaps in Canadian regulations in comparison to global progress. This research will generate scientific public health data to answer specific questions related to symbolic claims used on foods, an important and growing area of food marketing that has not been well studied."
Occupational exposure to low doses of ionizing radiation and incidence of dementia among Nuclear Energy Workers in the Canadian National Dose Registry.,"['Frangione, Brianna']",['N/A'],"['Dementia', 'External Cohort Comparisons', 'Internal Cohort Comparisons', 'Ionizing Radiation', 'National Dose Registry', 'Nuclear Energy Workers', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Poisson Regression']",105000.0,497338,"Low-dose ionizing radiation (<100 mSv) is a ubiquitous environmental exposure that has been studied in numerous exposed populations. Few studies have been conducted on workers exposed to chronic low-dose ionizing radiation in the nuclear industry, and almost all of them have assessed the effects on cancer incidence and mortality. Epidemiological studies of low-dose ionizing radiation exposures have shown these exposures may increase the risk of neurodegenerative conditions, including dementia. To date, there have been relatively few studies of occupational exposure to radiation and the risk of dementia, and these studies have relied on the measurement of dementia using death certificates. The use of death certificates to identify individuals with dementia is a significant limitation, as dementia is not usually identified as the principal underlying cause of death. We propose carrying out the first epidemiological study of occupational exposure to ionizing radiation and incident dementia in a cohort of approximately 45,000 Ontario Nuclear Energy Workers from the Canadian National Dose Registry (NDR) and their linkage with the ICES (Institute of Clinical and Evaluative Sciences) repository. We will compare the overall rates of dementia in the exposed cohort to the general Ontario population to determine if there is an excess risk due to radiation exposure. We will also compare the rates of dementia within the exposed cohort based on increasing dose exposures to evaluate if there are any dose-response relationships. We will report the associations stratified by age and sex. The findings of this study will inform the scientific community about possible increased risks of dementia concerning occupational exposure to ionizing radiation."
"My Neighbourhood, My Mobility, My Health: A Prospective Study of Older Adults' as they Strive to 'Age in Place'","['Franke, Thea']",['N/A'],"['Aging In Place', 'Built Environment', 'Constructivist Grounded Theory', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Longitudinal Qualitative Research', 'Mobility', 'Older Adults', 'Social Environment']",105000.0,327877,"Limited mobility predicts mortality and is a consistent risk factor for disability, social isolation, and cognitive impairment. It is estimated between 60% and 85% of adults globally are not sufficiently active. As health and function decline with ageing, older adults' ability to engage with challenging built environments (e.g., long distances to amenities) is reduced and subsequently, mobility, health and opportunities for social engagement are compromised. It therefore is not surprising to learn that older adults repeatedly report feeling trapped in their own homes and approximately one third of older people leave their homes on average only twice a week. Thus, elements of the built environment (e.g., sidewalks, street lights, benches, public washrooms) are essential elements that support older adults' outdoor mobility. Optimal mobility is evidently an important element of healthy aging. Yet, older adult's perception of their mobility, mobility preservation and how that changes as they age are not well understood. The main objective of my doctoral research will be to improve our understanding of how OAs experience their health and mobility in their communities and what built environment and social environment factors impede, empower, engage and/or support their mobility as they age. I will accomplish this by interviewing community dwelling older adults, as well as collecting physical activity, mobility and built and social environment data on their neighbourhoods over a period of four years. I will work with our interdisciplinary (CIHR funded) research team's strong network of decision maker groups, including health care providers, city planners, policy makers and older adults to create accessible and novel tools that will be used to inform decision making (i.e. promote, implement and design environmental and lifestyle factors that are relevant to older adults mobility needs), and ultimately contribute to their independence, health and mobility."

Interventions to promote housing stability and health for homeless persons have shown promising results. However, the evidence of ‘next steps’ for the recently homeless, in terms of integration into their broader communities, remains unknown. We argue that research into integration processes for homeless populations is a key domain of evidence to support health and housing projects already in place, and to mitigate the risk of recidivism. We propose to conduct a scoping review to provide an overview of the size and scope of the published and grey literature to date on the measurement of community integration (CI) of homeless persons (Goal), specifically by (Objectives): 1) identifying conceptual models and operational definitions of CI of homeless persons; 2) identifying how CI of homeless persons has been measured; 3) identifying gaps in the measurement of CI of homeless persons; and 4) identifying factors that have been reported to influence CI of homeless persons.Project Outputsinclude: an overview of the conceptualization and measurement of CI of homeless persons and suggested future directions for research; and the development of a working conceptual model of CI of homeless persons.We will apply the only model developed so far on CI for a homeless population (with psychiatric disabilities in supportive independent housing) (Wong and Solomon, 2002) and draw on conceptual and methodological knowledge in the more established area of research on CI in disabilities and rehabilitation. We will search for papers on conceptual models, measurement, or interventions related to CI of homeless persons. Screening criteria relate to type of paper, participants/population, interventions, outcomes and language. We will search for published and grey literature in electronic databases, from governments and key organizations, by hand searching key journals and conferences, and using snowball techniques.We will extract data (direct quotes/summaries) from papers related to background information (e.g., purpose,), study information (e.g., measures of CI), and the study population. Data will be numerical (e.g., year), categorical (e.g., study design), and textual (e.g., definition of CI). A flow chart will summarize the results of the search and screening. Coding categories (developed collaboratively) will be used to code the data. We will summarize the coding results, write narrative descriptions to provide an overview and suggest future directions, and design a visual conceptual model of CI of homeless persons.We will use an integrated knowledge translation (KT) approach whereby the entire team will contribute to all aspects of the study (e.g., searching), including the development of a (KT) plan to reach researchers, policy makers, practitioners, and the general public.The proposed scoping review is a first step in collating emerging knowledge on the measurement of CI of homeless persons. Our overview will inform potential new areas of primary and secondary research Our working conceptual model will contribute to building the theory of CI of homeless persons. Ultimately, our scoping review is part of an overall research agenda to inform policy and practice to improvehealthandquality-of-lifeoutcomes for homeless persons so that they can become engaged in the broader community instead of being marginalized and isolated."

This is important given women are one of the fastest growing subpopulation of homeless persons today. Moreover, violence is identified to be a key cause and consequence of homelessness among women. Evidence suggests that women who are homeless often experience many forms of violence over the lifespan including childhood abuse, domestic violence, street-victimization and exploitation (e.g., street predators, drug/survival sex-trade), discrimination and stigma, and histories of colonization among Indigenous women, for example. However, the nature and extent of violence and its impacts among women who are homeless has yet to be synthesized and embedded in prevention and intervention policies and practices. Thus, we propose to conduct a systematic review of the published literature to date to assess the prevalence, nature and severity of violence experienced by homeless women over the life course to understand violence in this population. The review will be guided by trauma- and violence-informed frameworks and include mixed-methods research to shed light on the key risk, protective and broader socio-structural factors that shape victimization and its effects in this population. The primary purpose of this review is to establish the foundational knowledge base needed to inform a conceptual model for gender- and trauma-responsive policy and practice, and guide future research directions. Our team is uniquely positioned to directly apply the results via key government and community stakeholders and national networks actively working to eradicate homelessness and gender-based violence across Canada."

Influence of the built environment on activity levels and cardiovascular health in the elderly.,"['Fraser, Katelyn']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Arterial Stiffness', 'Cardiovascular Physiology', 'Physical Activity']",17500.0,224462,"As the population ages, the number of people with age-related diseases (e.g. cardiovascular disease) will increase. Health care strategies will have to focus on prevention as a way of reducing the risk of these diseases or else the associated costs will be a huge burden on the social economy. Regular physical activity improves the quality of life and reduces the risk of many chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease. Despite its known benefits, many older Canadians are not getting enough physical activity. It is hypothesized that if older individuals can easily incorporate physical activity into their everyday life, they will be more likely to be physically active. In some communities, the physical layout of the neighbourhood or the built environment can create barriers to exercise. For example, a lack of sidewalks or cycling lanes, and long distances between the home and shops or fitness facilities, increase the likelihood of using a car rather than an active mode of transportation. A community that opts for a healthier, active design, such as more sidewalks and walking paths to amenities, sets the stage for its residents to be more active and maintain healthier lifestyles. A relationship between the built environment and cardiovascular health has not been shown in an elderly sample. The purpose of this study is to determine physical activity levels and cardiovascular health in an elderly Canadian sample in relation to their built environment. With this, we hope to create a basis for more population-based strategies that will increase physical activity and thus improve cardiovascular health in our aging population."

The economy of the Upper Saint John River Basin (USJRB) is based mostly on forest and transportation industries. While these economic activities bring benefits to the region, they can contribute to the emission of environmental contaminants, which can easily cross national borders and affect the health of the population on both sides. The World Health Organization estimates that 20% of cancer cases worldwide are attributable to environmental exposures. A recent survey showed that cancer rates are a concern for the Madawaska County citizens. Both sides of the River have high incidence of colorectal and lung cancers. However, there are no studies that provide the potential effects of the environmental contamination on the USJRB population health. The objective of this postdoctoral research is to develop a participatory and interdisciplinary project based on health and environmental concerns of the USJRB population. The research will document these concerns and identify influential regional stakeholders in environmental health in four phases: (1) A web-based survey to describe the social network of stakeholders in the USJRB; (2) Workshops with USJRB's communities (Madawaska County, Aroostook County and Madawaska Maliseet First Nation) to collect citizen's concerns about health and the environment; (3) Meetings with local stakeholders in order to co-construct an environmental health study in the USJRB, based on citizen's priorities, that will be submitted to the CIHR Project Grant competition in Spring 2020 and (4) the implementation of the study by collecting evidence based on selected priorities (research survey, environmental and biological material sampling, etc.).

Using these data, we reported in 2018 that 5.7% of Canadian adults ages 45-85 years old had visual impairment.  We were unable to determine the frequency of eye disease because the CLSA does not include a comprehensive eye exam by an ophthalmologist or optometrist so the data on eye diseases like cataract, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy are based entirely on self-report, which is known to have limited accuracy. Therefore, it would significantly enhance the CLSA data if eye disease could be determined from provincial health administrative records.  Furthermore, the CLSA has collected retinal image data although it has not yet been graded.  We propose to use automated software to grade these images for characteristics like retinal vessel width, which may indicate not only eye disease but also brain disease.  We will then use this information to better understand whether eye disease influences the risk of cognitive decline, stroke, and poor balance.  Our work will turn the CLSA from a good resource for vision research into a phenomenal resource, not only for Canadians but for the world."

The proposed PhD research and thesis will investigate health care system utilization of centenarians living Ontario.  Under the direct supervision of Dr. John Hirdes, Provincial level data from the Resident Assessment Instrument 2.0 (RAI 2.0) used in Ontario Complex Continuing Care Hospitals and data from the Resident Assessment Instrument - Home Care (RAI-HC) used in Ontario Community Care Access Centers will be assessed.  Data related to care service utilization, indicators of physical and mental health, as well as, levels of quality of life will be analyzed.   Conclusions of this study will assist in effective funding allocation through increased understanding of how centenarians access and use the health care system.  Recommendations will be made to ensure health care services will be effectively targeted to meet the needs of the oldest old and help to empower them. 
The care provided by informal caregivers reduces the demands on the health care system and can prevent or delay institutionalization or the need for more formal paid caregiving services.  In my previous research caregivers of centenarians tended to be older and in poorer health.  By building upon previous findings and investigating the determinants of centenarian caregiver health status, health care providers and policymakers will better understand how they affect institutionalization of care recipients.  With increased knowledge in this area, it may be possible to decrease the levels of caregiver burden and depression, as well as increase quality of life.  In turn, if resources are properly directed to meet the actual needs of burdened caregivers, institutionalization can be delayed or avoided completely, and the burdens of the aging society on the health care system may be partially alleviated."

Analysis of the Nak'azdli elder's survey, conducted in the spring of 2016, showed sharing cultural knowledge and traditions was a priority for Nak'azdli elders. Therefore the main goal of this research project was to facilitate opportunity in the Nak'azdli community to share their knowledge and culture using digital storytelling and to build connections between Nak'azdli elders, youth, and the larger community. Our team included the Nakalbun School, Nak'azdli Health Centre, Nak'azdli Elders Society, Nak'azdli Youth Council, and researchers from the University of Northern British Columbia, Simon Fraser University, and the University of Waterloo. Together we introduced a digital storytelling workshop at the Nakalbun Elementary School using technology as a means to facilitate knowledge-sharing between elders and youths. 

The Nak'azdli elder storyteller led the workshop with support from academic and community partners.  Over the course of ten 2-hour workshop sessions, the Nak'azdli elders and youths worked in small groups to produce a digital story highlighting a story from their culture. WeVideo, a cloud-based video editor, was used as it makes editing in a browser fun and simple. The WeVideo software enabled students and elders to drag images and videos into a timetable, record voices and sounds to coincide with an image, and add a music track to create their digital story. 

We will discuss how the workshop was tailored to meet the needs of the Nak'azdli community and how it combined cultural and traditional teachings while using modern technology to support broader communication. We will report on the feasibility to integrate digital story telling into the school curriculum and to support Elders working with youths in a meaningful way to bridge the intergenerational divide."

The objectives of this study are: 1) To provide novel information on the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on academic achievement among Ontario secondary students, and 2) To disseminate a novel, interactive, electronic platform for knowledge users (the Province of Ontario's Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO),educators, school board members), to share information on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on academic achievement. The platform will also be available to the general public. An integrated knowledge mobilization approach (iKMb) using population level data, in partnership with EQAO, will be conducted to achieve our research aims. As part of this approach, knowledge users will inform the project from start to finish. iKMb is the ideal approach in understanding and addressing the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on academic achievement; it gives the broader educational community the evidence to support the implementation of educational recommendations designed to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Ontario students. Since education is among the most important modifiable determinants of health, understanding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on academic achievement is an important step in mitigating the impacts of the pandemic on children's future health."
Playing by the rules: Legislating Health in All Policies,"['Freiler, Alix']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1270.0,345368,"Governments are increasingly using Health in All Policies (HiAP) approaches to improve health equity. However, the challenge of coordinating traditionally ""siloed"" policy sectors remains. As a result, governments have used a number of strategies to encourage sectors to work together towards improving health equity. Specific policy design may motivate non-health sector participation in HiAP activities. However, there is a gap in the literature examining the role of policy design in addressing complex policy issues, such as health inequities. We are interested in understanding the role legal HiAP mandates, such as those found in Quebec and Thailand, play in motivating sectors to participate in HiAP. In our multiple case study project, we examined HiAP cases from nine jurisdictions: Sweden, South Australia, Quebec, Ecuador, Norway, Scotland, California, Finland and Thailand. We interviewed stakeholders involved in the implementation of HiAP, including civil servants, politicians and academics. Analysis focused on explaining the mechanisms behind why and how sectors decide to participate in HiAP, with a focus on the contextual factors that make each case unique. We found that, although having legislation requiring sectoral participation in HiAP may be effective at having sectors work together, there are multiple strategies governments can employ to encourage participation. In addition, legislating intersectoral action does not necessarily result in strong sectoral participation, or a particularly motivated workforce, which may ultimately weaken the implementation of HiAP. This research helps to understand how and why policy design influences policy implementation, particularly for complex policy issues. While each case's context influences how HiAP work."
The role of sexual functioning in a biopsychosocial model of disability in inflammatory bowel disease: From research to knowledge translation,"['Fretz, Katherine']",['N/A'],"['Biospychosocial Model', 'Disability', 'Diversity', 'Inflammatory Bowel Disease', 'Lgbtq+', 'Sexual Difficulties']",105000.0,416784,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic illness with disabling repercussions. Sexual difficulties (SDs) are consistently reported by patients but are rarely addressed in disease management. Research on sexuality in IBD is limited. SDs are more prevalent among IBD patients compared to controls, and they relate to worse disease activity and disability. Yet, little is known about the progression from IBD disease activity to SDs to disability, or factors that may buffer this process. Objective 1 of my research is to empirically model this process in a large IBD sample. 

Another gap in the IBD literature is an examination of LGBTQ+ individuals' experiences, which is troubling given that minorities face health disparities and issues in the healthcare system. One study found that LGB IBD patients reported issues arising from the intersection of identities of being a sexual minority and having a chronic disease. Thus, LGBTQ+ individuals may face specific challenges related to SDs and accessing healthcare that warrant investigation. Objective 2 of my research is to query these issues using quantitative and qualitative methods in a diverse subsample. 

Objective 3 is to use the findings from above to implement a knowledge translation plan. Due to the lack of attention SDs and diversity receive in IBD disease management, educational resources will be created for patients and healthcare providers with information about such issues, tips on having respectful and inclusive conversations about sexuality, and resources for the management of SDs within the context of IBD. This educational program will be delivered online and through in-person workshops. 

This work will have important impacts on the IBD literature, healthcare services, providers, and patients by advancing knowledge and providing a framework for IBD disease management that considers SDs - a taboo albeit critical aspect of well-being - and diversity - an essential piece of effective and ethical patient care."

Unfortunately, breast cancer treatments often have physical and psychological side effects. Breast cancer survivors have a high risk for a recurrence, second cancers, heart disease, weight gain, bone loss, fatigue, anxiety and depression. Regular physical activity can improve the physical function of breast cancer survivors, help manage some short-term side effects of treatment and reduce the risk of recurrence. Many breast cancer survivors have high levels of sedentary behaviour (time spent sitting). To date, little is known about how sedentary behaviour or fitness may affect breast cancer outcomes. To date, physical activity has not been adopted into regular cancer care and no individualized guidelines are possible regarding the type and volume of PA necessary to improve survival after breast cancer.  

We initiated the Alberta Moving Beyond Breast Cancer cohort study in 2012 to address this knowledge gap. We recruited 1528 female, newly diagnosed breast cancer patients and are following them for an average of 12 years for all disease outcomes. Participants have completed several questionnaires, undergone physical fitness tests, been assessed for lymphedema (swelling in the arms), peripheral neuropathy (nerve pain in limbs), had their body composition measured (body fat, lean mass), given fasting blood samples and worn devices that objectively measure their physical activity and sedentary behaviour at breast cancer diagnosis and  at 1, 3, and 5 years. To complete our cohort study, we now need to: 1) measure biomarkers in the blood samples; 2) complete collecting the 5-year questionnaires, 3) analyze these data, and 4) publish results. Our analyses will examine how these lifestyle factors are associated with survival outcomes. This study will lead to improvements in both clinical guidelines and public health recommendations on physical activity for breast cancer survivors."

We expect the result to describe that particular problem. But what if the test also reveals a different, unrelated issue? What if it finds an increased risk of cancer or risk of developing an untreatable dementia?

This is the possible scenario with a test now being introduced: genomic sequencing.  This new technology can examine our entire genome (all the genetic material in our cells).  Let's say a person has multiple seizures or intellectual disability of no known origin. If a doctor suspects a genetic cause, the individual may be sent for genomic testing. BUT... each one of us carries a number of genes for problems that may or may not show up in our lifetimes. A mutation in these genes may put us at an increased risk of cancer, heart disease, dementia, or a variety of other problems. Or they might predispose to happy old age! These are the gnomes of genomic testing.

Right now, there are no guidelines regarding what the lab should tell the doctor or what the doctor should tell the patient about these unexpected results. They are ""incidental"" to the lab or doctor but may not seem so ""incidental"" to the patient. Would you want to know? A further complexity is that because genomic testing is so new, geneticists do not always know the significance of all findings. This knowledge will come in time, but what should we do with this information now?

Technology has got ahead of us. There has been little discussion among geneticists and no input from the general public regarding the implications of genomic testing. Now is the time for public involvement and guidance. Come and help us to discuss these difficult but fascinating societal issues."
"Head acceleration events in female high school: An attempt to ""take down"" concussion in wrestling","['Friesen, Kenzie']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,495170,"Background: Youth concussions are typically caused by sports and contribute to a significant public health burden. Despite the vast implications of youth brain injury, understanding the risk of concussion in sporting contexts is poor given the difficulty in monitoring concussive risk factors and events. 
Objective: To assess head biomechanics during high-school wrestling matches.
Methods: Twenty-nine female (ages 15-18) high-school wrestlers competed in 229 high school wrestling matches (2022-2023 season) while wearing instrumented mouthguards (iMGs) to measure head movement and head biomechanics. Head impacts were categorized based on video-analysis according to mat placement (centre/edge), offensiveness (offensive/defensive/neutral), and wrestling manoeuver (hand-fighting/headbutt/head snap/ground move/pin/takedown/throw/other). Peak biomechanics were examined and mean differences across position, offensiveness, and wrestling manoeuvre were estimated using multiple multilevel linear regression nesting athletes within teams.
Results: iMGs recorded a total of 1,315 video-verified head impacts. Mat location was not associated with head biomechanics. Offensiveness type was significantly associated with peak angular velocity: head impacts during neutral moves demonstrated significantly lower head accelerations relative to offensive moves. Wrestling maneuver displayed a significant relationship between peak linear acceleration and head-butting and takedowns relative to hand-fighting. Head-butting, ground moves, takedowns, and other manoeuvres were associated with increases in head linear velocity relative to hand-fighting. Finally, only ground moves and takedowns were associated with increases in peak angular velocity relative to hand-fighting.
Conclusion: Head impacts in high school youth wrestlers vary according to offensiveness and manoeuver, with high impact manoeuvres resulting in higher head accelerations."

The research will explore a hypothesis that for this particular group their uptake of HIV messaging is shaped and in some ways impeded by the ways that HIV risk in various discourses is linked to African countries and African people. The project builds on previous research partnerships with community organizations and community members that explored the social determinants of HIV and risk prevention for this at risk group of youth immigrants from HIV-endemic countries. Our research gave a clear indication that HIV is not an issue that is talked about in their communities and that one of the reasons has to do with the racialized stigma associated with HIV as a set of representations or discourses. Now moving forward in the multiyear research project, we aim to use qualitative research methods with community members as peer researchers to highlight the experiences and perspectives of African newcomer youth as active social actors in the negotiation of sexualities and sexual decision-making. To show how youths' sexual self-understandings are influenced by sexual health discourses, a second research strategy will use media analysis methods to gather data on the specific discourses, also by training a youth as a peer researcher.

This project is the outgrowth of a community-university partnership in Winnipeg, partly funded by a CIHR MPD Grant, that facilitated an exchange of knowledge about sexuality, sexual health and sexually transmitted infections with African newcomer youth grappling with cultural norms from their African heritage and Canadian society in the negotiation of safe sex practices. A clear message from these exchanges was that a public discourse around sex and sexuality was missing within these communities and that knowledge about culturally-sensitive strategies was sorely wanted in order to reduce their vulnerability to HIV infection related to linked factors of poverty, race, cultural gender and sexual norms, and stigma associated with sex and HIV. It was also clear that to be effective, intervention needs to engage the community at all levels of research and implementation including the research process, from design to data collection to youth-focused delivery of the messaging. Given the lack of information on youth and sexuality and HIV in ethnic minority immigrant populations in Canada, this project seeks to expand the scope of community-research partnerships to three cities in western Canada and the number of youth participants in order to develop a multi-year project using community-based research principles. The strength of the project lies in the multi-disciplinary regional team approach to CBR for HIV risk reduction targeted at and engaging marginalized and under-represented youth in African newcomer communities in identifying cultural factors that put them at risk.

A life course approach to mental health of older refugees: A community-based participatory research study,"['Frounfelker, Rochelle']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Mental Health', 'Refugees', 'Social Epidemiology']",90000.0,412318,"Background: The number of civilians forcibly displaced from their homes due to war and political violence reached over 60 million in 2015. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees estimates that older persons make up roughly 8.5% of the total population of displaced individuals. These individuals often receive limited attention from national and international aid providers although they are more likely to experience physical and psychological distress than younger refugees. After resettlement, older refugees experience challenges related to language barriers, family stress, social isolation, finding employment, and accessing health care. These experiences, in turn, are associated with poor mental health. Unfortunately, there are few evidence-based health-promotion interventions designed to meet the needs of older refugees. 
Objectives: The goal of this proposal is to identify risk and protective factors for mental health and well-being of aging refugees residing in North America and develop best practice guidelines for clinicians and other health care providers working with this at-risk population. 
Methods: Quantitative analysis of data from 200 older refugees will characterize the relationship between past exposure to pre-resettlement stressful life events, experience of current resettlement stressors, and severity of mental health symptoms. A collaborative partnership between refugee community stakeholders, researchers, and mental health providers will translate study findings into best practice guidelines for mental health care providers who work with older refugees.  
Implications and Public Health Significance: Findings from this proposal will increase our understanding of the impact of displacement on long-term mental health and inform clinical and policy interventions to improve mental health and successful aging of older refugees in Canada."

This talk describes the findings of an exploratory study conducted with GSP attendees and hosts/organisers in Victoria, BC. Several distinct sexual communities were identified, with variation among and within groups in terms of sexual consent and STI disclosure. Interviewees discussed at length the issues of harm reduction and consent, suggesting that these factors contribute to participants' GSP experiences regardless of their sexual community. These insights suggest that GSP could be an avenue to understanding how harm reduction practices could be integrated with the pursuit of sexual pleasure, information applicable in the context of sexuality education programs."

"Assessing facilitators and deterrents to meeting WHO Baby-Friendly Hospital guidelines: An institutional ethnography of infant feeding practices at St. John's General Hospital, St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador","['Fullerton, Laura M']",['N/A'],"['Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (Bfhi)', 'Breastfeeding', 'Document Analysis', 'Health Promotion', 'Infant And Young Child Feeding (Iycf)', 'Institutional Ethnography', 'Maternal-Child Health', 'Maternity Experiences Survey', 'Population And Public Health', 'Structured Interviews']",8750.0,234304,"The World Health Organization (WHO) and Pubic Health Agency of Canada recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life or longer to ensure optimal infant health and development.  Breastfeeding supports healthy immune function, infant nutrition, mother-child bonding, and protects against sudden infant death syndrome, opportunistic infections and future health complications.  Although benefits are well evidenced and recommendations are clear, Newfoundland and Labrador (NL) has the lowest rates of exclusive breastfeeding at six months in all of Canada.  The WHO has developed a Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) to promote optimal infant feeding practices in healthcare settings, however none of the 34 Baby-Friendly birthing facilities in Canada are located in NL.  Using an institutional ethnographic approach, this research will: 1) assess infant feeding practices at the St. John's General Hospital using BFHI guidelines, 2) identify facilitators and deterrents for optimal infant feeding healthcare delivery, 3) review policy and clinical guidelines for infant feeding practices at the provincial, health authority, and hospital level, and 4) assess patient healthcare experiences.  Research findings will be used to help bridge the outcome gap between internationally recognized best practices for infant feeding, and infant feeding practices in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador."
Using public policy to support public health providers and Indigenous leaders as change champions in initiating action on climate-related food insecurity and health in Canada's North,"['Funnell, Sarah', 'Muray, Mwali']","['Horsley, Tanya A', 'Dabone, Charles', 'Fitzgerald, Michael L', 'Giroux, Isabelle', 'Horn, Ojistoh K', 'Jull, Janet E', 'Kehoe MacLeod, Krystal J', 'Kenny, Tiff-Annie M', 'Konikoff, Lauren', 'Kristjansson, Elizabeth A', 'Neufeld, Hannah J', 'Patel, Kruti', 'Robidoux, Michael', 'Skinner, Kelly', 'Tanuseputro, Peter', 'Wang, Katelyn', 'Wesche, Sonia']","['Champions', 'Change Management', 'Climate Change', 'Food Insecurity', 'Indigenous Communities', 'Public Policy']",125000.0,485320,"Climate-related food insecurity (CRFI) is a significant threat to Indigenous Peoples due to high food prices, lack of traditional foods, and income constraints. CRFI is an issue of national concern. Many public policies addressing food insecurity in Canada are not well suited to Northern contexts. They do not address food system-related problems as being interconnected to climate change. Policy options in the North must take a rights-based approach and be focused on Indigenous-led solutions. Change Champions (CCs) can help policy become standard practice; however, there is a gap in understanding how CCs are being used to facilitate transformative action on CRFI in the North. This study explores how Indigenous community and public health CCs are being leveraged and resourced by policymakers to mobilize collaborative climate action to increase food security in the North. Using content analysis, interviews/sharing circles, and a co-design workshop, this project will: (1) Describe CCs among Indigenous community and public health leaders in the North, and how their roles, responsibilities, supports, and desired outcomes are portrayed in policy, (2) Seek to understand the experiences of CCs working to operationalize action on CRFI in the North (e.g., community health representatives, cooking circle leaders, health centre physicians or nurses, etc.), and (3) Identify strategic opportunities for intersectoral/cross-jurisdiction collaboration/knowledge exchange where Northern CCs co-design strategies to better leverage public policy as a tool to mobilize action on food insecurity. The research team will consolidate policy options for all government levels and share them using policy briefs, infographics, media briefings, and community-level workshops to inform education and programming on food security in the North. This diverse and multidisciplinary research team has a strong representation from Indigenous researchers, clinicians, and collaborators."

This crisis, which is more evident in Aboriginal (sic) populations, has long-term implications for the health and well-being of these communities"". Food insecurity in Inuit households ranges between 24% and nearly 70% at the regional scale and is as high as 85% in some communities. This is in comparison to a prevalence of food insecurity in the country that, while still on the rise in many jurisdictions, sits at 12%. This Letter of Intent proposes to consult and work with regional representatives in 3 Inuit regions of the Canadian North to develop a Team Grant application that will support Inuit regions in addressing the issue of climate change impacts on food security. The Team Grant will be overseen by an Inuit Advisory Committee and will focus on three primary areas: Objective #1: Knowledge user-directed analysis of existing and recently generated food security datasets at the regional and community scales to examine issues of scale, temporal change, and role and strength of climate sensitive determinants influencing Inuit food security status including previously excluded elements of regional and community food environments; Objective #2: Development and application of a common implementation analysis approach to document and evaluate the role of candidate pilot interventions for Inuit food security in response to climate change in each of the participating regions; and Objective #3: Qualitatively validate currently used food security tools in each region and explore tool adaptation via generation of more region-specific and culturally appropriate definitions/conceptualizations of Inuit food insecurity via an approach focused on community and regional participants' knowledge and experiences."
Cannabis and the opioid crisis: Scoping the literature to understand the relationship between cannabis and opioid use and related benefits and harms,"['Furlan, Andrea D', 'Porath, Amy J', 'Sauvé, Brittany', 'Taha, Sheena A', 'Carnide, Nancy']","['Abramovici, Hanan', 'Campo, Michael', 'Divine, Heather A', 'Douglas, Joyce', 'Dubey, Anita', 'Hopkins, Carol A', 'Pant, Sirjana', 'Rosenberg-Yunger, Zahava R', 'Cardoso, Siobhan', 'Irvin, Emma L', 'Mahood, Quenby', 'Mittal, Nimish', 'Murphy, Laura', 'Popal, Sudaba', 'Van Eerd, Dwayne', 'Ware, Mark A']","['Benefits', 'Cannabis', 'Harms', 'Opioid Crisis', 'Opioids', 'Scoping Review']",59645.0,378634,"Canada is facing an unprecedented opioid crisis. There is a movement to consider cannabis as a tool in the fight against the crisis. However, some are concerned cannabis may increase opioid use or exacerbate harms. The potential spillover effects from changing cannabis-related policies, attitudes toward cannabis, and cannabis use patterns on the opioid crisis, whether beneficial or adverse, cannot be disregarded and requires a systematic synthesis and mapping of the literature to understand the relationship between cannabis and opioid outcomes. 
We are proposing a scoping review of the literature to better understand what is known about the relationship between various indicators of cannabis exposure and opioid outcomes. We will summarize findings, identify primary themes and knowledge gaps, and propose key areas for future research. We will use the Canadian Drugs and Substances Strategy as a framework for our synthesis, mapping the findings to its four pillars (Prevention, Treatment, Harm Reduction, Enforcement). Further, we will identify whether certain factors influence the direction of the relationship. Our team will follow standard scoping review methods, including a systematic literature search, selection of relevant studies using standardized criteria, extraction of relevant information, and collating and summarizing results using quantitative and thematic analysis. 
Response to the crisis should not occur in a vacuum and requires information from this review to understand how policies being developed for opioids and cannabis may intersect. Completion of this project will provide a synthesis of the evidence around possible links between cannabis and opioid outcomes within each of the pillars of the strategy and may identify subgroups for strategic targeting of future research and policies. Findings will be relevant to policymakers, healthcare professionals, public health officials, law enforcement, persons with lived experience, and researchers."

Measures aimed at improving opioid prescribing have been ineffectual and harm reduction measures have been needed to suppress the surge in mortality across the country. Despite these interventions, overdose deaths continue to climb. There is an urgent need to identify new, innovative and impactful solutions that can be implemented alongside measures already in place. Owing to the complexity of the crisis, no one solution will suffice. 

Existing evidence syntheses are outdated and fragmented, focusing on specific strategies, many already being used. We propose to conduct a systematic review of the effectiveness of strategies, programs, policies, practices, and interventions in preventing and reducing opioid-related harms that are not widely implemented as part of the current response. We will consider approaches encompassing goals of prevention, treatment, harm reduction, and enforcement and examine whether there is evidence to support the effectiveness of strategies in high-risk subgroups. We will consider scientific and select grey literature from the last 10 years to capture evidence for more current approaches. 

The review process will include developing clear research questions; conducting a comprehensive and explicit literature search; identifying relevant studies; conducting a quality appraisal; extracting relevant data; synthesizing the evidence. We will engage Knowledge Users and Collaborators throughout to guide the review.

Results will inform a coordinated and evidence-based response to address the wide scope of the crisis. Understanding whether certain approaches demonstrate effectiveness in high-risk subgroups will be important for strategic targeting of policies and programs. Findings will be relevant to policymakers, healthcare professionals, public health officials, first responders, law enforcement, regulators, persons with lived experience, and the community."
Meeting End-of-Life Needs of Older gbMSM with an Inverted SES Model of Health Promotion,"['Furlotte, Kirk']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,382971,"Older gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM) face unique challenges in end-of-life (EOL) care. In addition to specific age-related health issues, gbMSM face obstacles in accessing and engaging in healthcare services due to discrimination and stigma from homophobia and heterosexism.
The primary research question for this study was: ""What are EOL care experiences and expectations of older gbMSM in Canada?"" The barriers and facilitators older gbMSM face in EOL planning and where those barriers/facilitators fit within a social ecological (SES) model were explored.
Focus groups were held at research sites nationally with older gbMSM as part of the Fostering End-of-Life Conversations, Community and Care among LGBT Older Adults study in 2014/2015. Each focus group was facilitated by two members of the research team using an established set of semi-structured questions.
Focus groups were held with 40 old gbMSM in five sites (Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Montreal, and Halifax). Transcripts were thematically analyzed guided by descriptive qualitative methodology; major themes and issues were mapped to an inverted SES model for health promotion.
Older gbMSM report exclusion and further marginalization from the larger LGBTQ+ community, the healthcare community, and even their own community of care/support network. Recognizing the unique needs of this population can help reduce barriers to healthcare access and reduce the healthcare inequities faced by this marginalized group.
Limited research has been conducted on holistic approaches to EOL for older gbMSM Canadians with little focus on health promotion. The inverted SES model focuses on policy first and works out to the individual. By hearing first voice of the affected, marginalized population, policies and procedures can be created, adapted, or updated to address their needs. This approach recognizes change needs to made 'top down,' bringing the voices of those impacted 'up.'"
"For young drivers, by young drivers: Road traffic injuries and fatalities as a serious threat to the wellbeing and quality of life of Canadian youth and promising practices for engaging young drivers and passengers in road safety programming and initiatives","['Fuselli, Pamela A']",['N/A'],"['Driving Behaviour', 'Equity In Road Safety', 'Online Collaboration', 'Road Safety', 'Youth Empowerment', 'Youth Engagement', 'Youth Partnership']",6000.0,485613,"Road crashes are the third-leading cause of death among young people aged 15 to 24 years old in Canada. Youth and young adults are also killed in road crashes at a higher rate than any other age group under 75 years old (Statistics Canada, 2020). Furthermore, young people account for 25 per cent of all road-related injuries and fatalities even though they only make up 13 per cent of licensed drivers in Canada. Road crashes are a serious threat to the wellbeing and quality of life of youth in Canada.
 
Co-led by the Canadian Youth Road Safety Council, the For Young Drivers, By Young Drivers project aims to effectively address the issue of road fatalities among youth by partnering with this demographic to: understand the facilitators, barriers and attitudes/perceptions that affect safe driving behaviours in young drivers; identify new opportunities and channels for increasing youth awareness of road safety issues, with a specific focus on technology and communications solutions and; build a framework and tools that will guide engagement of young drivers and their passengers.
 
Informed by published research and other successful youth outreach efforts, almost 300 youth across Canada were engaged via focus groups, peer-to-peer interviews, and surveys to understand their thoughts on how they think and feel about safe driving behaviours, how they behave, what influences their behaviours, who influences their behaviours and where they go for trusted information on road safety. A dozen experts in road safety and youth engagement were also interviewed. Key learnings were complied into a framework and tools to provide road safety stakeholders with promising practices for engaging young people in road safety programming."
