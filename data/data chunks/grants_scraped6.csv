Integrating Indigenous Ways of Knowing into overdose responses for urban Indigenous people who use drugs,"['Lavalley, Jennifer']",['N/A'],"['Ethnographic Observation', 'Harm Reduction', 'Indigenous Research', 'Qualitative Methods']",105000.0,399549,"The overdose epidemic remains one of the most pressing public health issues in Canada. In British Columba (BC), Indigenous people who use drugs (IPWUD) have been disproportionally affected by the overdose crisis. Further, it has become clear that overdose epidemic patterns are different among IPWUD. For example, while non-Indigenous men are overdosing at greater rates than non-Indigenous women, Indigenous women remain disproportionately impacted by the overdose crisis, and are experiencing non-fatal overdoses and overdose deaths at rates similar to Indigenous men. Diverse models of overdose-focused interventions are now being implemented in jurisdictions such as Vancouver's Downtown Eastside neighbourhood. However, research to date has failed to examine the overdose risk environment surrounding IPWUD living off reserve in inner cities. Given the ongoing harms experienced by off-reserve IPWUD, research is urgently needed to improve overdose-focused harm reduction and substance use programs for this population. This study addresses this gap by using ethnographic approaches that center Indigenous knowledges and ways of knowing to examine how social-structural and environmental conditions shape access to and outcomes from overdose-focused harm reduction and substance use treatment programs among IPWUD. Findings from this study will contribute to the overdose response for IPWUD by identifying policy and programmatic changes to improve the public health benefits of overdose response services."
Qanuinngitsiarutiksait.2: Developing tools for the wellness and safety of Inuit,"['Lavoie, Josée G', 'Clark, Wayne', 'Dederick, Jeneen']","['Anang, Polina', 'Goulet, Sara D', 'Kenny, Kathleen S', 'McDonnell, Leah', 'Nickel, Nathan C']","['Inuit', 'Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit', 'Jurisdiction', 'Wellness']",1954576.0,443856,"Every year, thousands of Inuit from Nunavut (NU) come to Manitoba (MB) to access healthcare, education and other services. Some stay only to attend appointments, others longer to access services not offered in NU. Some do not return home for multiple reasons, including personal choice, constraints or because of on-going needs (e.g. long-term care). Our Qanuinngitsiarutiksait.1 (Q.1, tools for the wellness and safety of Inuit) study documented patterns of service utilization, including important mental health care needs that remain unmet. 
Objectives: Q.2 will focus on Inuit concepts of wellness, to answer: 
1. How did Inuit address issues of trauma and community/interpersonal tensions in the past? 
2. How was/is family/community cohesion maintained in Inuit culture? And 
3. How can this knowledge be used to create a continuum of healing programs reflecting Inuit values? 
We will undertake an Isumataiit Sivuliuqtii[Elders]-driven participatory study, involving aajiiqatigiingniq, an Inuit consensus methodology, which has also been used as the foundation of an Inuit wellness framework. This work will guide the development of a series of interventions implemented and continuously improved in the course of the study, including 1. the creation and trialing of an Inuit-centric healing program to be offered in Winnipeg; 2. An adapted version of the program tailored to the needs of Inuit women and girls recruited into and exiting human trafficking; and 3. An adapted version of the program tailored to the needs of Inuit families whose children are involved with Child and Family Services (CFS) system, to facilitate reunification when appropriate. This knowledge will be used to develop Inuit wellness programming to be implemented in different sites in Winnipeg. This proposal addresses priorities identified by the Isumataiit Sivuliuqtii, and will produce knowledge that will be directly applied to programming to improve Inuit wellness."
"The association between COVID-19-related attitudes, concerns and behaviours in relation to public health policies: A behavioural science approach to optimising policy strategies to improve health, economic and quality of life outcomes (the iCARE Study).","['Lavoie, Kim', 'Bacon, Simon L']","['Aaron, Shawn D', 'Barnett, Tracie A', 'Bélanger-Gravel, Ariane', 'Bondy, Susan J', 'Booij, Linda', 'Bourbeau, Jean', 'Campbell, Tavis S', 'Carlson, Linda E', 'Corace, Kimberly M', 'Drouin, Olivier', 'Fleet, Richard P', 'Garber, Gary E', 'Gauvin, Lise', 'Gordon, Jennifer L', 'Gosselin Boucher, Vincent', 'Gupta, Samir', 'Herba, Catherine M', 'Kakinami, Lisa', 'Pelaez, Sandra', 'Pilote, Louise', 'Poirier, Paul', 'Presseau, Justin', 'Puterman, Eli M', 'Rash, Josh A', 'Stewart, Sherry H', 'Stojanovic, Jovana', 'Vallis, Micheal T']","['Behavioural Science', 'Epidemiology', 'Health And Economic Impacts Of Disease', 'Mental Health And Coping', 'Motivation And Behavior Change', 'Policy Communication Strategies', 'Policy Planning And Decision-Making', 'Primary Prevention', 'Public Policy Adherence', 'Social Determinants Of Health']",638775.0,442925,"The key to halting the rapid spread of COVID-19 and 'flattening the curve' is public adherence to drastic, rapidly evolving behaviour-based prevention policies that are being implemented around the world. However, adherence depends on: public awareness of prevention policies; the extent to which the public perceives these policies as relevant and important; and their capability to enact them, which may be influenced by various demographic, family, occupational, health, and environmental variables. Further, as things start to re-open, people's willingness to adhere to new government decisions and recommendations (e.g., re: school openings, store openings) will also be critical for transitioning through the phases of the pandemic and improving the economy. Unfortunately, policies have varied greatly between provinces and countries, contributing to uncertainty about government policy motives and confusion about which policies to follow. Understanding people's concerns about COVID-19, their perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes about public health policies, and how they impact what people are (and are not) willing to do will be important for informing policy strategy and communication, to ensure the best health and economic outcomes. The iCARE Study will capture key data on people's awareness, attitudes, and behaviours as they relate to the COVID-19 policies, as well as, the impacts that COVID-19 is having on people's physical and mental health, financial situation, and quality of life. Data from approximately 150,000 people around the world will be linked to case data, policy data, and Google mobility data to understand what government policies are (and are not) influencing behaviour and outcomes, and in whom these policies are most or least effective. This will allow us to inform governments on the efficacy of policy measures on both people's behavior, and on key health and quality of life outcomes."

It is therefore highly probable that behavioural prevention policies, including additional vaccine doses, mask wearing, and distancing, may need to be re-introduced. In fact, many governments (including Canada) are already preparing for how to manage the next wave of the pandemic.
This application is seeking to expand our capacity to supply the Canadian government and other partners with data and information to support ongoing pandemic response and preparedness. We are seeking additional funding to hire an additional data analyst and post-doctoral student to help us exploit the data we are collecting through our ongoing CIHR-funded iCARE study. iCARE's objective is to monitor population attitudes, intentions and behaviours in relation to engaging in COVID-19 prevention behaviours as measures become increasingly relaxed/lifted, and in relation to the potential re-introduction of preventive measures if/when this may become necessary. We are also assessing what factors are motivating people to re-engage in these behaviours, in general and among vulnerable groups (e.g., racial & ethnic minorities, women, those with mental/ physical health conditions). The existing infrastructure of the iCARE study will be leveraged so that we may continue to provide timely data to local and international governments to inform policy. We will collect data in Canada and a sample of key countries (i.e., Italy, Ireland, France, Australia, and Colombia) chosen based on their relative position to Canada on the pandemic curve, their diverse policy approaches and impacts, and their geographical and population diversity."
Study of the determinants of nurses' and physicians' intention to practice an act of euthanasia in a context of palliative care.,"['Lavoie, Mireille', 'Godin, Gaston']","['Blondeau, Danielle', 'Martineau, Isabelle', 'Roy, Louis']","['Applied Ethics', 'Euthanasia', 'Health Behaviours', 'Healthcare Practice', 'Intention', 'Palliative Care']",253446.0,215513,"Euthanasia is still a controversial topic in Canada to this day, highlighting the clash between fundamental values and impassioned debates. Some groups are exercising more and more pressure to legalize its practice. Closely linked to the context of palliative care, euthanasia generates support which is far from unanimous among the health professionals taking care of persons at the end of life. The practice is criticized because it represents an act aimed at deliberately causing death, something which runs counter to the philosophy of palliative care. When supported, it is because it helps to relieve ""inhuman"" suffering or to support the sick person's autonomy.
Thus, if euthanasia were to be legalized, what would that mean for the autonomy of the caregivers requested to apply it? Current researches still provides little explanation of their intentions when faced with carrying out an act of euthanasia. This is why our project aims at studying the determinants of intentions of nurses and physicians eventually invited to perform an act of euthanasia in palliative care. It could enlighten decision-makers as to its possible impact on the practices of health professionals and caregivers themselves. It includes four objectives: 1. Identify the determinants of nurses' intention to practice an act of euthanasia or not; 2. Identify the determinants of physicians' intention to practice an act of euthanasia or not; 3. Identify the significant differences between the determinants in the predictability model of nurses compared to that of physicians; and 4. Measure the impact of the presence or absence of the person's wishes on the intention of the nurses (4a) and of the physicians (4b). The project is based on Triandis's psychosocial theory (1980) which permits, through a questionnaire, to study the determinants of the healthcare professionals' intention (Godin et al., 2008a)."
Sharing Youth's Storiis of COVID: Youth voice as a basis of understanding the broader impacts of adaptations in youth programming with a focus on micro populations,"['Lawford, Heather', 'Mahdy, Sharif']","['Berardini, Yana', 'Halsall, Tanya G', 'Khanna, Nishad', 'Ramey, Heather L']","['Lgbtq2', 'Mental Health', 'Participatory Research', 'Quantitative Research', 'Racialized Youth', 'Rural Youth', 'Youth In Care', 'Youth Living With Disabilities', 'Youth Program Adaptations', 'Youth Voice']",149809.0,450654,"This study invites 1,000 Canadian youth who are LGBTQ2, rural, Indigenous, racialized, in-care, and living with disabilities to share how COVID-19 and the restrictions it caused affected them. The study is led by Heather Lawford (Bishop's University) and Heather Ramey  (Brock University) in collaboration with Tanya Halsall, Yana Berardini, Nishad Khanna and The Students Commission of Canada (SCC), a national charitable youth organization. SCC will support other organizations across Canada to engage in the research. Adults and youth from these organizations will form advisory groups to participate in every aspect of the process. Together, they will explore how unique populations of youth might have been affected in different or similar ways by program and service changes that schools, recreation centres, doctors, employers, families etc. made throughout the pandemic. How did these changes affect young people's mental and physical health, their growth and development, and their relationships?  Did some changes improve life for some youth? Were some changes more harmful than others?
Findings from this study will be shared with all the participating youth and organizations, as well as at SCC's annual national #CanadaWeWant events. During these, youth members of the study's advisory committees will present findings to decision-makers, policy-makers and youth. The advisory groups will also advise on other ways to share knowledge from this study with their communities.
Results will inform governments and organizations know what changes they made during COVID-19 that they should keep doing: for example, increased on-line services that improved access to mental health counsellors. It will also increase understanding of inequities and harms that some youth from these populations experienced, so that these can be addressed through post COVID-19 programming and services. Youth voice and participation integrated with research is critical if we are going to ""build back better."""
Scaling Up: A Multi-Pronged Approach for Improving Mother and Child Oral Health in Aboriginal Communities,"['Lawrence, Herenia P', 'Fredette, Gilbert']","['Chartier, Martin', 'Gordon, Janet N', 'Cidro, Jaime', 'Gillis, Doris E', 'Hoffman-Goetz, Laurie', 'Maar, Marion A', 'Randall-Simpson, Janis A', 'Schroth, Robert J', 'Smylie, Janet K']","['Aboriginal', 'Children', 'Dental Caries', 'Disease Prevention', 'Health Policy', 'Health Promotion', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Oral Health', 'Population Health Intervention', 'Prenatal Women']",5860.0,324285,"Early Childhood Caries (ECC) is a multifactorial disease that affects disproportionately higher numbers of Aboriginal children than non-Aboriginal children in Canada. While ECC is preventable, reducing the high rates of the disease among at-risk populations such as the Aboriginal Peoples in Canada remains a challenge, owing in part to the high levels of sugar that have entered the Aboriginal diet. This study focuses on the successful scale-up of an existing multi-pronged intervention for the prevention of ECC in Aboriginal communities. The intervention comprises four components: dental care offered to prenatal women, topical fluoride varnish applications to their infants/toddlers' teeth, oral health anticipatory guidance and motivational interviewing delivered by community-based researchers to mothers at critical early developmental stages in their children's lives. These interventions have been shown to be either effective or promising in preventing ECC and reducing caries in Aboriginal children. Researchers and community members, including knowledge users and knowledge holders will work together on how the interventions can be adapted to cultural, historical and contemporary Aboriginal contexts and the current health care delivery systems. The approach will center on knowledge sharing so that the interventions are fully synergized with local community ways of knowing. We plan to study the implementation of the adapted/enhanced interventions in at least four geographically diverse First Nations and Métis communities with differing levels of readiness/capacity for the intervention. The objective is to confirm that the set of interventions identified for scaling up are indeed effective and will remain effective (or become more effective) when appropriately adapted across these communities. The overarching goal is to bring about tangible improvements in young Aboriginal children's oral health and wellbeing thereby reducing oral health inequalities."
Development of an international research initiative in childhood asthma,"['Lawson, Joshua A']","['Adamko, Darryl J', 'Rennie, Donna Carole']","['Asthma And Asthma-Like Symptoms', 'Child Health', 'Diagnosing Patterns', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Geographic Variation', 'Global Health', 'Population Health']",12500.0,308192,"Asthma is a global problem affecting approximately 10% of children worldwide and has huge individual, social, and health care burden. Since 2009, we have established an international collaboration with a common goal of investigating childhood asthma. What began as Canadian support for an Eastern European research and education program has developed into an international research program including Canada, Belarus, Ukraine, and Poland. In order to strengthen and advance this collaboration in an effort to improve the knowledge of childhood asthma, we feel that it is important to develop, through partnership, a research program that involves all the research centers including Canada and to investigate the potential expansion of this research network. The overall objective of this activity will be to summarize progress to date, identify future research directions, and consider expansion of the research network in conjunction with an international health symposium. This will be completed through two days of research meetings specific to the team. The meetings will precede the 7th International Symposium: ""Safety and Health in Agricultural and Rural Populations: Global Perspectives"" in Saskatoon in October 2014. Following the research meetings, team members will participate in the Symposium, including a session on global perspectives on childhood asthma where current asthma research and management will be discussed through dissemination of the project to date allowing feedback from scientists, clinicians, policy-makers, and community members attending the Symposium. These activities will strengthen current collaborations and help focus asthma programs in Canada and internationally. Long term implications of this program include improved quality of life of children, reduced health care resource use and explanations of geographic and temporal variations in asthma through more appropriate diagnosis and management as well as improved etiologic understanding."

The prevalence and severity of asthma among children in a north-central Saskatchewan region,"['Lawson, Joshua A']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal', 'Asthma', 'Epidemiology', 'Lung Function', 'Obesity And Health Behaviours', 'Pediatric', 'Population-Based', 'Rural', 'Skin Prick Testing']",150000.0,213843,"The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence and severity of asthma among children in a north-central Saskatchewan region. The indoor environment, including tobacco smoke and home mold, has been suspected to play a role in asthma development but the contribution of obesity and health behaviours has been studied less frequently. Two understudied populations with regard to asthma are rural dwellers and Aboriginal persons. Obesity, health behaviours, and environmental exposures in these groups have been shown to differ from urban populations and may help explain recent geographic and temporal variation in asthma prevalence. Finally, it is becoming apparent that there are differences in the association between various exposures and asthma by sex. We aim to determine if there are differences in these outcomes by area of residence (urban vs. rural) and by Aboriginal ancestry. We will also investigate associations between determinants of asthma including obesity, health behaviours (eg. physical activity, diet and sedentary behaviours), and the indoor environment with asthma presence and severity. Finally, we will investigate potential effect modification by area of residence, Aboriginal ancestry, and sex with these determinants. We will use a cross-sectional study of Grades 1-6 children attending school in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan that includes a questionnaire phase and a clinical phase (lung function testing, anthropometric measures, and skin prick testing). Investigation of asthma prevalence and severity and their determinants among these populations will help establish the level of disease burden, which has not yet been studied in this region, identify groups at higher risk of asthma, and will aid in addressing gaps in asthma etiology. This knowledge can help focus initiatives to prevent asthma and reduce asthma morbidity, resulting in better quality of life for children with asthma and lower health care costs in Saskatchewan and, more broadly, Canada."
Social Determinants of the Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis epidemic: Comparing Social Dynamics in South Africa and Peru,"['Law, Stephanie']",['N/A'],"['Disease Modeling', 'Ethnographic Study', 'Mixed Methods Research', 'Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis', 'Peru', 'Social Determinants Of Health', 'South Africa', 'Tuberculosis']",150000.0,299886,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide. TB causes disease in over 9 million persons and kills more than 1.5 million each year. While the estimated numbers of new TB infections and TB-related deaths have been falling since 2002, the worldwide emergence of strains that are resistant to the two most effective TB drugs - INH and Rifampin - threatens the progress made. These strains, known as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), cause between 8-9% of all TB deaths globally. More than half a million patients were estimated to develop MDR-TB in 2010. This drug-resistant strain of TB requires more costly, lengthy and toxic treatment that is often ineffective.

Existing research suggest there are many socioeconomic and health factors driving the MDR-TB epidemic, however it remains unclear which of these factors are most influential, and what the priority areas for programmatic changes should be in countries where the epidemic is rapidly growing.

There has been an enormous increase in MDR-TB over the past couple decades in South Africa and Peru. Between 2002 and 2008, the proportion of all reported TB cases in South Africa with MDR-TB increased from 3.1% to 9.6%. Meanwhile, the notification rate of MDR-TB in Peru has been increasing at approximately 4.3% per year since 1996. Although existing research has suggested many factors that contribute to the MDR-TB epidemic, there has been limited in-depth, ethnographic research exploring the social determinants of MDR-TB in any country, and even fewer modelling of how social dynamics may contribute to the epidemic. This project will use a mixed-methods approach containing ethnographic studies in Peru and South Africa, and disease simulation modelling to identify common pathways to the transmission and development of MDR-TB, and help identify key opportunities for intervention in both countries, and potentially globally."

Our research team is part of an international collaboration to develop country-based collections of patient experiences first developed at the University of Oxford (www.healthtalk.org) and now involving expert teams of researchers and patients in 13 countries. In this Canadian study, the real-life variation in women's experiences of HF will be presented, including women whose stories are often unheard. Our work will be informed by a framework that considers the different roles in women's lives and how those roles may affect women's health experiences and outcomes. Our project team involves patients and clinicians as partners, who will help to guide the types of stories we collect, how we interpret the results, and co-design the online resource. The website will feature a listing of trusted resources for HF patients, with links to reliable sources of information and support. We will evaluate the use and usefulness of the website from different perspectives.

The Life History of a PrEP Demonstration Project: An Ethnographic Exploration among Female Sex Workers in India,"['Lazarus, Lisa']",['N/A'],"['Fsws', 'Hiv', 'India', 'Prep', 'Prevention']",105000.0,348019,"Targeted structural interventions have led to a decline in HIV prevalence among female sex workers (FSWs) in India; however, prevalence remains well above the national average. The challenge lies in further reducing HIV incidence among FSWs. One possible approach to reducing HIV incidence among FSWs may be pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a new HIV prevention technology that involves the use of antiretroviral medications to reduce the risk of HIV infection. People who do not have HIV take a daily pill to keep the virus from establishing a permanent infection. PrEP is not intended to replace existing HIV prevention technologies and strategies. Rather it is intended to be used in combination with them. Although much is known about the efficacy of PrEP, a crucial gap remains surrounding its scale up. The World Health Organization (WHO) is encouraging countries to undertake PrEP demonstration projects to ascertain its real-world effectiveness. Building on a feasibility study that assessed the acceptance of PrEP among FSWs, the WHO and Gates Foundation have agreed to jointly-fund a 16-month project in partnership with two renowned sex worker-led organizations in India: Ashodaya Samithi in Mysore and Sonagachi Project in Kolkata. I propose an ethnographic study to explore how messaging practices influence uptake and retention over the life course of the project. Through extensive participant observation and field note composition in both study sites, as well as focus group discussions and qualitative in-depth interviews with health care professionals and community members, the proposed study will document the experiences of FSWs during the 16-month PrEP trial. The knowledge generated from this study is expected to reveal how informal and formal messaging surrounding PrEP supports (or inhibits) uptake and retention to inform the scale up of PrEP among FSW communities across India and beyond."

Assuming a lifespan, perspective, we hypothesize that health and health risk behaviors affect each other and are affected by risks and protective factors that characterize both individuals and the contexts in which the live. We highlight an important set of indicators that, together, paint a profile of health and health risks in the early adult years (physical health, mental health, stable relationships, low health risk behaviors and accruing labour market capital).We hypothesize that changes in  these five interdependent indicators of health in young adulthood are, to some degree, founded on stable individual differences that are already evident in adolescence. We also examine the prospective effects of multivariate risk factors (including disruptions and conflict in family of origin, deviant peer associations, serious injuries, weight gain, early school leaving, and early parenting, relationship aggression) and protective factors (family support [financial and emotional], peer support, on time graduation from high school, postsecondary school engagement, stable romantic relationships). These predictors can be and have been targeted by policy and prevention programs aiming to improve health across the lifespan and they have been extensively shown to effect late adolescent outcomes, however, their significance for health in young adulthood is largely unknown."

This is not unwarranted. Despite its current status as an illegal drug, Canadian adolescents are already among the youngest and most frequent users of marijuana in the developed world. According to a UNICEF survey (2013), 28% of 11 to 15 year old Canadians reported using marijuana in the last year. However, youth differ in their patterns of marijuana use - in both frequency of use and amounts used. Their patterns of use (typically called trajectories) can also change from adolescence to young adulthood. Understanding of the effects of different trajectories of marijuana use by Canadian youth requires longitudinal research and an interdisciplinary lifespan approach that can consider multiple predictors and stage-salient outcomes for men and women. A good deal of current research comes from the US and this research is narrowly focused on the effects small amounts of marijuana use on single. Research is needed to increase our understanding of the diversity of potential impacts of marijuana on Canadian youth. We will examine predictors and impacts of five different patterns of marijuana use (Abstainers, Occasional Users, Increasers, Decreasers and Chronic Users) on economic, academic, social, and mental health outcomes. Sex and gender differences in predictors and consequences of different trajectories of marijuana use will also be examined. We will use existing data collected from 662 (males) youth ages 12 to 18 in 2003 who were interviewed bi-annually for a decade (producing 6 waves of detailed data about their development from adolescence to young adulthood). Knowledge gained from this research will also inform stakeholder discussions about and selection of indicators for a Canada-wide longitudinal study that will improve our ability to monitor how youth are impacted by the legalization and regulation of marijuana."

At the same time, they are also the adult age group with the highest proportion of those unvaccinated. National and provincial public health leaders have identified young adults as having the highest risk of transmission given their employment in public-facing jobs, social mobility and confined housing. In order to improve vaccination rates, we need to understand reasons why young adults may not be getting vaccinated and use this information to develop and implement vaccination interventions for this age group. This proposal will work closely with young adults through our Young Adult Advisory Group. Our first aim is to engage up to 30 young adults through interviews to understand their knowledge and attitudes towards vaccination. Our second aim is to further develop, and implement, a mobile app, STOP COVID!, designed to improve vaccine confidence and, ultimately, vaccination. STOP COVID! will be a game-based app aimed at changing behaviour intention (nudging) young adults towards vaccination. Content will be science-based and informed by the findings of the first aim so that STOP COVID! will be tailored to young adults. STOP COVID! will be implemented in restaurants and public transit throughout British Columbia, and promoted through social media. We will evaluate the implementation of STOP COVID! to understand in what context is the app effective, in whom and why. Special attention will be made across a range of genders, ethnicity, education and geography across BC. We anticipate STOP COVID! will improve vaccine confidence and uptake in young adults, and with our public health partners, spread to other provinces in the future."

The anticipated outcomes from the program of research proposed here are designed to improve youth health in Canada by maximizing the use of existing COMPASS data and building new research and practice capacity that leverages my existing COMPASS resources to: address numerous applied public health questions (at multiple levels of influence, on multiple topic domains, that are relevant to numerous stakeholders); build the foundation for mentoring trainees and new investigators in the COMPASS model of applied systems thinking; strengthen national capacity required to Plan, Act, Evaluate and Adapt strategies to advance youth health in multiple domains; strengthen our ability to understand and address health inequities among high-risk groups; expand our ability to understand how different social and physical environments shape youth health trajectories or the outcomes of different programs and policies; and, foster more evidence-based practice through engaged partnerships between researchers and knowledge users. The scope of my program of research is clearly focused on generating practice-based evidence to advance youth health, and the breadth of my research program makes it relevant to multiple research areas of interest outlined for this CIHR funding opportunity."

The purpose of this proposal is to extend COMPASS for an additional 5 years (2017-2021). Each year, COMPASS collects longitudinal data from ~45,000 grade 9 to 12 students attending 89 secondary schools in Ontario and Alberta. The purpose is to evaluate how ongoing real-world changes in programs, policies, or built environment resources within or surrounding schools are related to changes in youth risk factors [tobacco use (including e-cigarettes), obesity, poor diet, physical inactivity, screen time, alcohol use, marijuana use, bullying] over time. Every year, more than 100 different changes take place that our large team of researchers and trainees are currently evaluating. Our team then takes this new evidence of what programs or policies work and we feed that information back to each participating school annually with customized tools to inform them of the best prevention interventions specific to their school population. 

There are 2 key benefits to extending COMPASS for 5 more years.

First, maintaining this internationally unique study is critical as it is just now starting to provide sufficient waves of longitudinal data to generate scientifically robust evidence of what programs or policies work over time to help prevent chronic disease related behaviour among youth.

Second, by building on the existing research infrastructure, we are saving valuable prevention resources, especially when COMPASS is the only study that can: 
•evaluate the 100's of changes that occur in COMPASS schools annually, 
•evaluate the impact of emerging provincial prevention initiatives (e.g., the Healthy Kids Community Challenge or the Smoke-free Ontario Strategy), or 
•explore how changes to federal policies (e.g., the potential legalization of marijuana in Canada  or changes to e-cigarette product regulations) impact youth behaviour over time."

Each year, data are collected from students and schools on a variety of content domains, including substance use (alcohol, cannabis, vaping, tobacco, opioids), mental health (depression, anxiety, flourishing, emotional regulation), and demographic characteristics (gender, ethnicity, affluence). The outbreak of COVID-19 in March 2020 has led to unprecedented rapid changes in the daily lives of youth, largely through the closure of schools to in-person learning. Since the onset of the pandemic, COMPASS data have also been collected from students specific to the impact of COVID-19 on their substance use behaviours and mental illness. This proposal is to extend COMPASS for an additional 5 years (2022/23-2026/27) to evaluate the ongoing impact that restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have on youth substance use and mental illness over time.

L'évaluation d'impact sur la santé comme vecteur d'intervention intersectorielle en aménagement du territoire,"['Lebel, Alexandre']",['N/A'],"[""Bourses De Voyage D'Aci""]",1500.0,368334,"Depuis plus de 30 ans, l'Organisation mondiale de la santé recommande la création d'environnements favorables à la santé (Charte d'Ottawa pour la promotion de la santé, 1986). Bien que cette recommandation soit largement intégrée dans les institutions de santé publique, elle demeure pratiquement inconnue parmi les acteurs municipaux. Conséquemment, peu d'initiatives concrètes et durables liant les intérêts de la santé publique et des municipalités ont été rapportées.
En 2012, le Centre de recherche en aménagement et en développement (CRAD) a entrepris de réaliser des évaluations d'impact en santé (EIS) sur des projets d'aménagement du territoire de la ville de Québec. L'EIS est une procédure qui permet de juger les effets possibles, et parfois non intentionnels, d'un projet sur la santé de la population. En collaboration avec la municipalité, la Direction régionale de santé publique, des promoteurs privés et des organismes à but non lucratif, cette initiative a permis de réaliser une EIS sur six projets urbains.
L'objectif de ce projet est d'évaluer dans quelle mesure la démarche EIS permet la prise en compte des considérations de santé dans les projets d'aménagement du territoire. Trois dimensions seront évaluées: 1) l'utilité des recommandations, 2) la portée du transfert de connaissances, 3) le potentiel de développement d'une communauté de pratique intersectorielle durable.
Dans le contexte où le gouvernement du Québec vient d'adopter une Politique en prévention de la santé (2016), l'évaluation de cette initiative universitaire pourrait être particulièrement avantageuse pour le développement de villes en santé. En effet, la Politique recommande explicitement l'utilisation de l'EIS pour outiller les municipalités afin qu'une analyse des effets potentiels sur la santé soit intégrée de façon plus systématique dans la planification territoriale. Ultimement, cette expérience pourra orienter d'autres initiatives pour les villes en santé au Québec et ailleurs au Canada"

As a result, many cancer survivors are discharged from cancer centres, and receive their follow-up cancer care from their primary care provider (e.g., family physician or nurse practitioner). Survivorship care plans are recommend to help ensure that the transition back to primary care is smooth, and that cancer survivors receive high quality care. The Wellness Beyond Cancer Program in Ottawa Ontario provides individualized survivorship care plans to breast and colorectal cancer survivors and their primary care providers when they are returning to their primary care provider for follow-up care. While survivorship care plans are recommended, it is unclear whether they are effective transition tools. This lack of clarity in the research may be the result of differences in how survivorship care plans are used across studies. This proposal aims to: a) use a theoretical framework to identify factors that influence the use of survivorship care plans in urban, rural, and remote locations; and b) develop specific strategies to ensure that survivorship care plans are used effectively. Thirteen breast and colorectal cancer survivors, 13 male colorectal cancer survivors, and 13 primary care providers from urban, rural, and remote areas will be recruited through the Wellness Beyond Cancer Program. Participants will be invited to participate in a 45-minute telephone interview on factors that impact their use of survivorship care plans. Based on the results of these interviews, specific strategies will be developed to help cancer survivors and primary care providers use survivorship care plans. Developing ways to optimize the use of survivorship care plans is important because they can help ensure that cancer survivors receive high quality follow-up care."

Dispatchers must cope with a rapid succession of emergency calls, interact with highly distressed callers often over a prolonged period of time, and coordinate interprofessional communications in order to achieve positive outcomes. Furthermore, dispatchers are not physically present at the site of an emergency; they often report feeling isolated and powerless to assist during the emergency and are generally unaware of the resolution of the event. The proposed research project is a pilot study aimed at generating preliminary data regarding the interactions of mental health disruptions, mediating factors, stress responses and performance in an understudied population that is regularly exposed to salient stressors.  In this study, participating dispatch workers will be required to respond to a simulated 9-1-1 call from a member of the public. A number of psychosocial and physical stressors will be added to the scenarios. The participants¿ stress responses (subjective and physiological) will be assessed. Furthermore, a number of potential predictor variables will be assessed in order to determine whether they mediate responses and performance during acute events. The proposed project represents the first study in a developing program of research aimed at understanding the effects of acute stress and trauma on police dispatchers. The findings of this study will be used to inform the design of subsequent research projects aimed at examining how these factors of interest play out in real world scenarios.

Les LMS constituent l'affection professionnelle la plus fréquente des pays industrialisés, responsables de l'incapacité de travail de 4 à 5% des travailleurs adultes et de deux tiers des lésions indemnisées. Elles ont un impact social majeur sur l'individu et la société allant de la perte d'autonomie au déclin de la qualité de vie, en passant par la perte d'un emploi ou la dépression.
A ce jour, aucune étude sur les LMS ne s'est intéressée à la population des jeunes travailleurs. Ils présentent pourtant un profil tout à fait particulier. Bien qu'ils ne travaillent que 10% des heures de l'ensemble des travailleurs, ils sont victimes de 16% des lésions professionnelles. D'autre part, la moitié des accidents chez les jeunes surviennent dans les six premiers mois d'un nouvel emploi, contre un tiers toutes classes d'âge confondues. Enfin, malgré une durée d'indemnisation inférieure à la moyenne, les jeunes semblent manifester un taux plus élevé de rechutes dans l'année qui suit l'accident et un taux d'atteinte permanente à l'intégrité physique et/ou psychologique deux fois supérieur. Ce risque accru s'accompagne de différences en termes de conditions de travail (horaires irréguliers, cumul d'emplois, stress) associées à une augmentation des accidents et de leur gravité.
Cette thèse va permettre de cerner le contexte d'apparition initial des LMS. Ce modèle pourra ensuite être généralisé à d'autres lésions, utilisé dans un but prédictif ou encore servir de base à la conception d'interventions de prévention. Au-delà de son apport scientifique, nous souhaitons que l'étude trouve un véritable écho auprès des jeunes travailleurs à risque d'incapacité et tout sera mis en oeuvre pour relayer nos résultats dans les milieux de travail concernés, en veillant à en souligner les implications pratiques."

"Interactions between environmental factors, low-penetrant genetic susceptibilities, and colorectal cancer risk in Atlantic Canada","['Lee, Derrick G']",['N/A'],"['Colorectal Cancer', 'Epidemiology', 'Epistasis', 'Gene-Environment Interaction', 'Genetics', 'Occupational Exposure', 'Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism']",99450.0,421842,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers in Canada, second only to lung cancer; it is also one of the deadliest cancers in the country. The number of Canadians diagnosed with CRC varies considerably by region; however, Atlantic Canada has the highest rates of any part of Canada. Newfoundland and Labrador has almost double the national average, and the rates of the other three provinces are well above the national average. Investigating the unique factors that contribute to the alarming rate of CRC in Atlantic Canada can help us better understand this disease and reduce its overall impact on Canadians.

The goal of this proposed research is to explain and identify how environmental and genetic factors contribute to high CRC rates in Atlantic Canada. Environmental factors play a major role in the high rates of CRC observed in Atlantic Canada - a region with some of the highest rates of smoking and obesity in Canada; however, genetics may play a large role in why these rates are occurring in Atlantic Canada. Many Atlantic Canadians share a similar heritage, as many residents can trace their ancestry to the first European settlers. Given that family history is a major risk factor for CRC, the existence of an inheritable set of mutations unique to this population, especially in genes that influence the carcinogenic effects of smoking, could explain the high rates of CRC within this region. 

Identifying gene mutations associated with CRC, especially ones unique to the Atlantic region, can help create more advanced biomarkers that can be used in screening programs. The development of novel biomarkers will allow us to identify the disease in its early stages and potentially save lives. Moreover, by better understanding the role of gene mutations in CRC risk, we can better describe the impact of environmental factors and identify those at greater risk of CRC."

"Variability in responses of antimicrobial resistance genes to lifting COVID-19-related measures among different population groups : A comparative study of the general public, university campus community, and marginalized groups","['Lee, Jangwoo']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2000.0,495187,"COVID-19 pandemic posed a serious threat to the public health, resulting in an unprecedented level of travel restrictions across our societies. As a result, in Alberta, both domestic and international travel decreased significantly during the travel restriction compared to the previous years, then gradually recovered upon lifting the restriction from 2022-March. Such changes in the governmental measure might have had an impact on the public antimicrobial resistance (AMR), as evidenced by other studies reporting association between travel and AMR (Heß et al., 2019 Env Sci Tech; Ricotta et al., 2014 Am J Public Health), but the impact has not comprehensively been studied. For the first time, our team monitored occurrences of AMR genes in different population groups in Calgary, including the general public, university campus community, and marginalized groups, during the transition period (Oct 2021 - Oct 2022), leveraging multi-disciplinary efforts spanning wastewater-based surveillance (WBS), geography, genomics, computer and statistical sciences.
We first (1) sequenced genomic DNAs in wastewaters obtained from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs; covering > 1M serving population), a university residence hall, and a homeless facility in Calgary during the monitoring period, (2) identified AMR genes from the samples using bioinformatics, and (3) correlated those genes with domestic and international passengers. Many genes of clinical concern (for beta-lactamases, MLS, and fluoroquinolones) increased significantly after lifting travel restriction. Consequently, those genes correlated positively with either domestic or international passengers, depending on the population group (p < 0.05). Our approach emphasizes the significance of travel as a key factor influencing public AMR. Additionally, it highlights that AMR transmission or carriage routes differ among population groups, underscoring the importance of customizing resource allocation for equitable health outcomes."
"Advancing dietary assessment capacity and knowledge in Canada by applying Canada's Food Guide 2019 to examine the relation between diet, individual characteristics, and incidence of cancer in Alberta Tomorrow's Project","['Lee, Jennifer J']",['N/A'],"['Cancer', 'Cohort', 'Diet Pattern', 'Dietary Guidelines', 'Health Equity', 'Machine Learning']",165000.0,492930,"Healthy eating is important for our health. Canada's Food Guide was updated in 2019 to help Canadians make healthier food choices. But it does not align well with other guidelines, especially those designed to prevent cancer that recommend eating less red meat. The Food Guide also does not consider individual characteristics, like income, that can affect our nutrition and health. Current analytical methods used in nutritional studies may not capture the complexity of diet patterns and individual characteristics. There is a lack of tools for long-term nutritional cohort studies to look at diet quality in the Canadian context. The Healthy Eating Food Index-2019 is a diet quality assessment tool that measures how well diets follow the Food Guide. But it was designed for 24-hour dietary recall data so it cannot be used in many long-term nutritional studies using food frequency questionnaires. This project's goal is to improve a food frequency questionnaire commonly used in long-term nutritional cohort studies (Canadian Diet History Questionnaire) to examine the relationships between diet quality relative to the Food Guide, individual characteristics, and cancer. This project will take place in 2 parts within the infrastructure of Alberta's Tomorrow Project, which has been following >50,000 Albertans since 2001. First, new food group information will be added to the Canadian Diet History Questionnaire to calculate diet quality scores indicating how well diets follow the Food Guide. Then the new diet quality scores will be tested against the scores calculated using 24-hour dietary recall data. Second, the relationships between diet quality scores from Part 1, individual characteristics, and cancer will be examined using machine learning techniques. This project will help increase the research community's ability to examine Canadians' diet quality and find new relationships between diet, individual characteristics, and health to address differences in dietary guidelines."
Seeing wrongs and seeking justice: The effects of mercury exposure on perceptual and sensorimotor ability in an Indigenous community (Grassy Narrows First Nation),"['Lee, Jennifer L']",['N/A'],"['Environmental Health', 'Functional Ability', 'Indigenous Health', 'Integrated Knowledge Translation', 'Mercury Exposure And Toxicity', 'Neuroscience', 'Perception', 'Sensorimotor Function', 'Vision']",135000.0,492876,"The Grassy Narrows First Nation community has been engaged in a decades-long struggle to improve the health of their community and environment after an industrial paper-producing plant in Dryden, Ontario (Treaty 3 area) discharged toxic levels of mercury into the English-Wabigoon River system. This resulted in dangerous levels of human Hg exposure through the consumption of freshwater fish, which are a cultural, dietary, and economic mainstay of this community. Mercury poisoning is known to target the brain and nervous system. Exposure has been associated with a range of sensory, motor and neuropsychiatric symptoms and vision loss in this community. 

Despite these challenges, individuals are often able to compensate for and adapt to visual deficits in order to accomplish everyday activities. This study aims to characterize the perceptual and sensorimotor processes that contribute to functional resilience. It further aims to identify candidate neuroprotective factors that contribute to better cognitive, visual, sensorimotor, and functional outcomes. Findings will be used to develop rehabilitative protocols and sensorimotor therapies for the upcoming Mercury Care Home and Wellness Center, that may help to slow, lessen, cope with, or reverse the functional losses related to mercury exposure. 

Drawing on comprehensive pre-clinical and clinical assessments, questionnaires, and historic and current biomarker data, the Niibin study is a community-university research partnership developed according to the OCAP® principles of ownership, control, access, and possession of First Nations information. It aims to understand how cumulative mercury exposure gives rise to the range of health challenges faced by the community today and to inform diagnosis and treatment throughout the stage of mercury impacts. All research will be carried out in close collaboration with community members via the Grassy Narrows Mercury Justice Team, from study design to dissemination of results."

This proposition, however, hinges on safe and healthy working environments for all workers. More than 2.8 million people across the world die at work every year due to poor occupational health and safety practices. South Korea (hereafter Korea), despite its high standard of living, has one of the highest rates of fatal occupational injuries among OECD countries, even after joining the ranks of ""developed"" nations. In the winter of 2018, the Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) Act in Korea was revised after 28 years to reinforce corporate responsibility for ensuring a safe and healthy work environment for workers. This legislative reform, however, has been met with considerable opposition from victims' families, unions, and labour health activists, who have long envisaged more fundamental reform to address the root causes of serious work-related injuries and deaths, such as the outsourcing of dangerous work through elaborate networks of subcontracting. This research project aims to explore the ways in which the problem of work-related injuries and deaths is understood, problematized, and consequently addressed in Korea, especially throughout the recent legislative reform. I will conduct a critical discourse analysis of the law reform process, drawing on Foucault's notions of discourse and the power-knowledge nexus. Findings from this research will provide new insights into the ability of the revised OHS Act to protect workers' health and safety in Korea by explicating the concepts, assumptions and claims underlying the revised Act. It is my hope that this research will ultimately pave the way for implementing more adequate regulatory reforms that can promote safe and healthy working environments for all workers in Korea, and other emerging economies with similar problems so that 2.8 million workers across the world will no longer have to die for a living."

This partly explains why commercial (non-traditional) tobacco use among Aboriginal Canadians remains three times the rate of non-Aboriginal Canadians, causing much higher burdens of tobacco-related disease and death. This study is prompted by substantial evidence that engaging communities to make their own decisions, about health and well-being, leads to more appropriate and stronger commitments to public health interventions, and ultimately more positive health outcomes. The project will undertake a consultation intervention which engages FN communities in BC in generating new knowledge about their specific contexts, needs and priorities related to tobacco control.  This consultation process will be enabled through a partnership between the BC First Nations Health Authority (FNHA) and SFU.  The knowledge generated will enable the creation of a comprehensive and culturally appropriate Menu of Tobacco Control Measures.  This menu will set out the full range of supply- and demand-side tobacco control measures available to FN communities, and best practices for how measures could be implemented in a culturally appropriate manner within communities.  The consultation intervention will then be evaluated to draw lessons for appropriately engaging with FN communities, in the design of tobacco control strategies that serve community needs and priorities, selected from a full range of potential measures. The findings will inform the development of follow up projects, to strengthen tobacco control strategies, focused on collaboration with Aboriginal communities in Canada and globally."

The complex nature of global health issues, including infectious diseases, requires new research and practice that supports innovative solutions to collective action. The proposed network will bring together Canadian expertise, experiences and approaches from the social and health sciences. The network will draw on Canadian efforts to build health governance within Canada as a country of remarkably diverse populations, geographical size, and global connectedness. Core values defining Canadian approaches to nation-building and global citizenship, notably social justice and equity, will be the basis for important insights for building global infectious disease governance. These insights will be catalysed through the network to support interdisciplinary and intersectoral research on global infectious disease governance. As part of an emerging international network of social science researchers, importantly, the focus of this network will be on identifying potential solutions, rather than further description, of the problems faced. The network will be structured around priority challenges to global infectious disease governance which Canadian researchers, in particular, can contribute new ideas, evidence and innovative solutions. These challenges will include strengthening representation, multi-level governance, evidence-based policy, and resourcing of global infectious disease governance. The two co-leads of the proposed network (Lee and Kaida) will bring complementary training in social and health sciences, decades of leadership experience, and well-established collaborative links within Canada and globally. They will be joined by leading scholars, policy makers and practitioners with deep knowledge of GHG and infectious diseases."
Defining and measuring the commercial determinants of health as risk factors for non-communicable diseases:  Advancing a new framework for addressing the global epidemiological transition,"['Lee, Kelley', 'Freudenberg, Nicholas']",['N/A'],"['Commercial Determinants Of Health', 'Corporate Actors', 'Global Health Governance', 'Global Health Policy', 'Non-Communicable Diseases']",20000.0,411906,"The steady and continuing rise in the prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), notably since the 1990s, is profoundly challenging ""the very foundations of public health"" according to the World Health Organization. NCDs now cause 71% of deaths worldwide, affecting populations at every income level in every country. Given the prohibitive costs of treating NCDs, this trend is also worsening health inequities. There is thus an urgent need for more effective prevention strategies focused on reducing the risk factors associated with NCDs. Traditional approaches have focused on metabolic and modifiable behavioural risk factors, such as reducing tobacco use and increasing physical activity, but the need to also change the social conditions shaping these risk factors is now widely accepted. The concept of the commercial determinants of health (CDH) has been put forth in this context. One commonly used definition is ""factors that influence health which stem from the profit motive."" Current definitions, however, remain difficult to measure and operationalize to inform public health action. The purpose of this project is to develop a clear definition and set of indicators to measure CDH as risk factors for NCDs. Following the completion of a scoping review, we will bring together leading experts, from both the research and policy communities, to develop a composite CDH Risk Factor Index and preliminary methodology for its application to selected populations. The index will seek to measure risk of NCDs in a given population associated with CDHs. The outputs produced by this project will include a CIHR project grant application to pilot this definition, index and methodology as a novel approach for understanding the relationship among three types of NCD risk factors (metabolic, modifiable behavioural and CDHs), how CDH risk factors contribute to patterns of NCDs in a selected population over time, and how these metrics can inform public health action to reduce NCDs."

During the COVID-19 pandemic, countries have used travel measures to an unprecedented degree and in an uncoordinated way. Our Pandemics and Borders Project is analysing a global dataset on travel measures; systematically reviewing evidence of their impacts; and conducting case studies of decision making in Canada, USA and Hong Kong. Our findings suggest limited scientific evidence and principles to guide complex decisions on using travel measures. Poorly coordinated border management contributes to underreporting of cases, increased disease transmission, and unnecessary economic and social impacts. The proposed project will build on these findings to support evidence-informed decision making on whether, when, what and how travel measures should be used. Our aims are to: 1) comparatively review and apply new methods to assess public health risks from travel during COVID-19; 2) evaluate the effectiveness of mitigating public health risks during COVID-19 of specific travel measures under different conditions; and 3) use findings to develop scenarios and pilot training exercises that simulate decision making on managing borders during PHEICs. We will use systematic reviews, various types of modelling, and viral genomic analyses to newly available datasets. We will focus on our three current case studies, with potential extension to other jurisdictions. Our interdisciplinary team, composed of 5 internationally recognized scholars and 6 outstanding trainees, will work collaboratively with knowledge users in senior national and international positions. We will produce open access datasets, methods and analyses to inform decision makers in government and key international organizations. The primary outcome will be strengthened capacity to make evidence-informed choices that enhance coordinated use of travel measures during PHEICs."

This project will conduct a gender analysis to identify and document the differential gendered effects of the outbreak and gaps in preparedness and response measures in a dynamic way, providing real time guidance and recommendations to those crafting policy and public health interventions. We will: map and analyze sex disaggregated data on COVID-19 infections and mortality to provide evidence to inform public health responses, decision-making and planning; document and analyze gender impacts of the outbreak in order to strengthen understanding of the impact of COVID-19 on individuals and communities through chatroom and social media analysis and interviews with those infected and affected; conduct gender-based analysis of national and global responses through policy analysis and key informant interviews; produce knowledge translation resources, including a gender matrix and toolkit, to improve policy and public health responses to COVID-19. Findings will contribute to the global response of COVID-19 through strengthening understanding of how individuals and communities understand and react to the disease. The COVID-19 Gender Matrix will be a living, online tool presenting gender analysis questions and data as it is gathered and serving as a template to measure gender indicators, if and where the outbreak may spread.

Moreover, they compound loss of life and illness by contributing to unnecessary social and economic disruption, and can discourage countries from open reporting for fear of retaliation. For these reasons, the World Health Organization (WHO) declaration of the COVID-19 outbreak as a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) included recommended, evidence-based measures for detection, containment and control based on available data. These measures adhere to International Health Regulations (IHR) principles concerning human rights, proportionality, and unnecessary interference with trade and travel. Yet preliminary analysis suggests a higher number and range of non-compliant measures are being adopted than previous PHEICs. The goal of this project is to strengthen global coordination of the COVID-19 outbreak response through a fuller understanding of crossborder measures adopted, their likely positive/negative impacts, reason(s) for adoption, and strategies to increase compliance. This project applies a mixed-methods approach to achieve 4 objectives: a) define, categorize and track crossborder measures adopted during the COVID-19 and previous outbreaks; b) systematically review existing evidence of their public health and wider impacts; c) understand decisions to adopt compliant or non-compliant measures in 4 case study settings (Australia, Canada, Hong Kong and US); and d) identify strategies to encourage increased compliance. Working closely with key knowledge users, including WHO, we will collect and analyze new data, and combine it with our existing datasets to conduct real time quantitative cross-outbreak analysis. The key outcome of this project is to mitigate the rapid spread of COVID-19 through practical, evidence-informed strategies that strengthen global coordination."

Currently, data on consumption of foods and beverages and eating behaviour in Canada are collected at distant time points, almost 10 years apart. This data provides a limited snapshot for government to make decisions about nutrition policy and programming. One of the Public Health Agency of Canada's main activities is to monitor and report on the state of health and health behaviours among Canadians. Currently, the Agency provides information on the amount of fruits and vegetables and sugar-sweetened beverages consumed. The Agency has an opportunity to update these measures to include monitoring of a range of food and nutrition behaviours, for example, using nutrition labelling to help make food purchases. Further, current research suggests that behaviours are affected by physical and social environments (food environment) and policies that influence the sustainability of the food supply (food system). However, a comprehensive framework of measures that includes food environments and food systems currently does not exist for Canada. The proposed work will identify existing questionnaires and assessments used at global, federal, provincial, and territorial levels to measure food and nutrition behaviour, food environments, and food systems. We will search current literature and work with partners across Canada to develop a framework for food and nutrition measures that will be integrated into the Agency's national surveillance strategy. We will also survey a range of audiences and collaborators from government, non-profit organizations, policymakers, and researchers to develop a strategy for communicating the framework. The proposed work will improve the health of Canadians and the health system by providing ongoing monitoring of food and nutrition in Canada to inform policy and programming decisions."

Facing extreme poverty and a lack of protection, these households are sexually vulnerable, and therefore at risk of HIV infection. And yet, youth demonstrate resiliency, as they care for siblings and as solve their daily challenges. 

A social suffering approach argues that it is often the poor and weak members of a society that suffer physically from social injustices. In this view, the vulnerability of youth-headed households to HIV is strongly linked to social inequalities. This study takes a qualitative, participatory, community-based approach to examine the sexual health of youth. The daily experiences of youth in the face of sexual vulnerability will be explored as well as the social factors that influence their ability to be resilient. Finally, youth's healing strategies and their access to health and social services will be examined. A total of 70 male and female youth-heads of household aged 15-24 years from one urban and one rural area in Rwanda will participate. Methods include observation, in-depth interviews and participatory group activities with youth. Focus group discussions with community members and health and social service providers will also be done. This is an Interdisciplinary Studies Doctoral project and it will be carried out between 2011 and 2013.

The data generated from this study will be communicated to health and social policy-makers in Canada and Rwanda, as it will inform decision making on programs designed to decrease HIV infection rates and improve the sexual health of youth. This study will also generate new approaches that can be used in Canada and internationally to work with young people to develop better links between health and social policy as a means to alleviate both individual and societal suffering and to reduce resultant sexual health inequities experienced by marginalized youth"

To protect this group of healthy volunteers, it is important that every donor candidate receive a psychosocial assessment before proceeding with donation. The assessment is used to ensure the donor is well-suited to donate, and to identify any potentially problematic areas where psychosocial assistance may be beneficial. Despite its importance, there are no standardized guidelines for the psychosocial assessment of living kidney donors in Canada.  As a result, the assessment is conducted differently across living donor programs, and, as of 2006, some programs did not have a mandatory assessment.  We have created a team of transplant researchers, social workers and psychologists who are motivated to work towards improving and standardizing the psychosocial assessment. We will administer a survey to living donor programs across Canada to examine how the assessment is currently being conducted, and simultaneously conduct a systematic review of the international literature on the psychosocial assessment. This work will provide the foundation for the development of standardized guidelines, bringing Canada a step closer to ensuring that all Canadian kidney donors receive the same optimal standard of care delivered in a reproducible and consistent manner."

For prostate cancer patients, the impact of treatments on sexual function is ranked consistently as a major cause of diminished quality of life. There are multiple established assessment tools on sexual well-being for heterosexual men, which have led to scientific knowledge that guides treatment decision. On the other hand, no such assessment tool has been developed for men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM). Therefore, prostate patients in this group and their physicians are often forced to make important decision without knowing the impact of treatments on sexual well-being.

Our team consists of multiple quality of life experts and oncologists specialized in prostate cancer, and we hope to develop a standardized assessment tool for sexual well-being in the MSM prostate cancer population. This tool will cover all areas of sexual quality of life, from emotional well-being, relationship, desire, and satisfaction, to erectile function, frequency, and physical comfort during sexual activity.

According to Statistics Canada, Prostate Cancer Canada, and Cancer Statistics Canada, over 25,000 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2012 and over 150,000 men were living with a prostate cancer diagnosis in the last 10 year. Assuming 5% of the Canadian male population is MSM, each year over 1,200 MSM are newly diagnosed with prostate cancer and over 7,500 are living with this disease. 

The assessment tool developed in our proposed study should become the essential instrument on which all future sexual quality of life studies in the MSM prostate cancer population will be based."

First, we examine the effects of socio-economic status (gender, race, education, marital status, income, and social support) on older adults' informal and/or formal home care use. Second, we study whether care use of older adults have different health outcomes (depression and life satisfaction) by informal and/or formal home care.
Using data from the Canadian Community Health Survey - Healthy Aging 2009 collected by the Statistics Canada, this study applies quantitative analyses. Among older adults with functional limitation, about 31% received No Care; 11% received Formal Care only; 31% received Informal Care only; 27% received both Formal and Informal Care. People who received Formal Home Care Only were more likely to live alone, had more education, and had less social support when compared to people with No Care. People who received Informal Home Care Only were more likely to be women, less likely to be married, and had more social support when compared to people with No Care. People who received Both Formal and Informal Home Care were more likely to live alone, more likely to be women, white, higher educated, and less likely to be married. Social support rather than financial resources emerge as the main determinants of receiving home care. Also, social support was positively associated with Informal Care, whereas it is negatively related to Formal Care. 
The findings from the population-based data will inform how the health of older Canadian populations and the health delivery system for older adults with functional impairment can be improved. Specifically, the findings will provide implications for policy and practice to improve the accessibility and availability of home care use."

These guidelines are mainly based on the best estimate available to show what MF strength will induce biological effects in humans. These MF effects still need to be experimentally proven as they are currently only educated guesses. Since 2005 we have been investigating 60 Hz MF exposures up to 3.0 milliTesla (mT) in humans. Our results showed some effects on human movement, psychological tests, and brain activity measured using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). Beyond their scientific importance, these results show what happens from an environmental and occupational health point of view. However, they are too subtle to prove a reliable threshold value as defined in the guidelines. This stresses the need for new studies testing higher exposure levels as well. The current proposal is thus focusing on the effect of 60 Hz MF up to 50 milliTesla on: 1) magnetophosphenes (seeing flickering lights) and the related brain electrical activity; 2) the effect on normal brain activity; 3) finger tremor (it is normal to have a little shaking in the fingers); 4) and standing balance. In addition, we will use modeling of brain activity to propose mechanisms of action supporting our experimental results. This complex project will establish, at a typical electrical power frequency, a threshold of exposure that will consistently produce an objective effect, characterize the brain structures involved in that effect, and validate the theoretical mechanisms of action that produce the effect. These results will assist future guideline updates protecting the public and workers' safety, and will produce fundamental implications for future therapeutic applications utilizing any positive effects of exposure to magnetic fields."
Optimizing the Ageing Brain? Situating Ethical Aspects of Dementia Prevention (BEAD),"['Leibing, Annette']",['N/A'],"['Bioethics', 'Dementia', 'Medical Anthropology', 'Philosophy Of Medicine', 'Prevention', 'Transcultural Research']",104213.0,426667,"Background: Dementia (the most common form is Alzheimer's disease) has for a long time been conceived of as an unpreventable process of mental deterioration. Now, however, researchers claim that one out of three dementia cases can be prevented if at least nine risk factors are man-aged. These risk factors include some that have not been traditionally linked to Alzheimer's, such as diabetes, hypertension, social isolation, and hearing loss, and which require management over the life course, making prevention a lifelong endeavor. Early detection through biomarkers and digital tracking technologies have also become a central feature of what we call 'the new dementia'. This raises a number of ethical questions, such as: should individuals be considered personal-ly responsible for their own dementia prevention? Should we accept extensive monitoring of our cognitive functions through digital technologies? What does dementia prevention entail for our healthcare systems and cultures of care? And, do national or local contexts play a role in how prevention is articulated and lived?    
Objectives: We propose a research project that studies in three countries the way the 'new de-mentia' is being articulated, and asks what ethical problems are arising, what the impacts are on health-related and everyday practices, and what solutions might be envisioned. 
Methodologies: We will study the 'new dementia' through complementary disciplinary approaches. We will adopt a comparative perspective looking at differences and similarities between three countries: Germany, Canada and Switzerland.
Expected outcomes: Our results aim to make people more aware that preventing dementia is a highly complex issue that needs to be seen in context through an extensive knowledge transfer on multiple levels."

"Building Capacity for Older Adult-driven, Neighbourhood Social Programs","['Leite Gonçalves, Priscila']",['N/A'],['Ageism'],1092.0,497954,"In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults face challenges in social engagement and community participation, aggravated by ageism, program cancellations and isolation. There is a growing demand for initiatives that foster social engagement, skill development, and community involvement among older adults, alongside a lack of information about how best to do so. To address this demand and build knowledge, we aim to explore the processes, impacts, and implications of creating inclusive, neighbourhood-based social programs in equitable partnership with older adults. Insights from ongoing research led by Dr. Carri Hand at the University of Western Ontario highlight inequitable access to social opportunities among older adults, self-directed ageism, and a need for affordable social programming in neighbourhoods, especially for those with mobility challenges. This literature gap and the demonstrated local need provide an ideal opportunity for the current project.

Using participatory research, we aim to foster diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as to understand the socially and historically situated experiences of older adults in two diverse neighbourhoods. The Participatory Process involves planning meetings with older adults interested in program planning and leadership, fostering their capacity to lead. The Implementation of Programs by older adult leaders aims to involve 8-20 diverse older adults for 25 weeks at 1.5 hours per session. This inclusive approach aims to address ageism and other intersecting biases (ableism, racism, classism, sexism, homophobia, and xenophobia).

By conducting surveys and interviews, we will refine this innovative model, creating guidelines for similar community programs. This study strives to enhance social participation and inclusion for older adults, contributing to their overall well-being in diverse neighbourhoods."

Work-related asthma (WRA) is a very prevalent condition and is likely to represent an important burden on the healthcare system. This condition may be preventable if  work exposures are identified and lowered. The broad aims of this research program are to assess the impact of WRA on the healthcare utilization (HCU) and costs related to asthma exacerbations as well as to identify the occupations and the specific occupational exposures associated with WRA in four Canadian provinces (Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia). Methods: The study will combine different designs to study 1500 Canadians workers with WRA (500) and non-work-related asthma (NWRA) (1000) selected by random digit dialing in the four Canadian provinces. The diagnosis of WRA or NWRA will be based upon the answers to a questionnaire assessing the relationship between asthma symptoms and work. The diagnosis of asthma will be confirmed by pulmonary function tests. The subjects will complete questionnaires to assess their occupational exposures. The HCU will be assessed by accessing the administrative databases of the 4 provinces. This will be the first study to assess concomitantly the burden of WRA in term of healthcare utilization and cost, the work exposures, and the clinical characteristics of the subjects at the population level, facilitating the generalizability of the results. This research program will be undertaken by a strong multidisciplinary team of researchers from Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. They will combine their various expertise through different methodological approaches for assessing the burden of WRA and improving its management."

This trend contrasts with the decrease in oral cavity cancer, most likely due to the decline in smoking. An even higher increase (40%)  was observed in anal cancer (AC)   incidence. Accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis that increasing oral and anal infection by human papillomavirus (HPV) is the cause of these additional cancers. This new reality is of concern for many developed countries: authors project that by 2020, HPV-related OC will have surpassed cervical cancers in numbers. However, by not taking in account the evolution of sexual behavior, extrapolating current trends based on past OC and AC incidence amounts to speculation. Yet, health policies such as the inclusion of boys in current girls-only HPV vaccination programs will need to rely on a  solid understanding of how OC and AC incidence will evolve in order to accurately analyze the benefits versus costs. It is why an investigation of potential causes of this trend is important. Following this global objective, this project aims more specifically to understand how changes in sexual behavior through the past decades can explain a higher incidence of oral-anal HPV. Additional objectives include a better understanding of the role of each site   (anal/oral/genital) and sexual act on overall transmission and assessing the impact of various vaccination strategies. We will approach this problem by using mathematical modelling. The idea of modelling sexually transmitted diseases is tried  and has been successfully used already for genital HPV but has never been applied to multi-site HPV. We will use data on sexual behaviour, smoking, and on oral-anal HPV prevalence to fit models.  In the pursuit of said objectives we will gain a better comprehension of HPV multi-sites transmission and the evolution of its spread which will allow us to determine optimal vaccination strategies."

"Country foods and cardiovascular health in Nunavik, northern Quebec:  studying the complex balance between nutrients and environmental contaminants","['Lemire, Mélanie']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal Health', 'Cardiovascular Diseases Risk Factors', 'Country Foods', 'Ecosystem Approaches To Health', 'Marine Mammal Consumption', 'Mercury', 'Nutrient-Contaminant Early Interactions', 'Participatory Approaches', 'Selenium', 'Selenoproteins']",140000.0,247366,"Food insecurity is frequent in Nunavik and the promotion of country foods can improve food quantity and quality in the villages. The Inuit diet is rich in selenium (Se), omega-3 fatty acids (n-3) and other nutrients, but can accumulate environmental contaminants such as mercury (Hg) and other persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Se is an antioxidant involved in several body functions through selenoprotein expression. High dietary Se intake may offsets Hg-toxic effects on health. Recently, high Se has been related to insulin resistance and other cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) risk factors in Europe and the US. To date, diabetes prevalence is low among Inuit and they present an excellent lipids profile. No association between blood Se and diabetes is observed, but recent results show significant associations between blood Se and arthrogenic lipids in young adults. Hg and POPs are risk factor for CVDs, while n-3 is a preventive factor. Several new Se biomarkers (eg. selenoproteins) may help to better characterise Se interactions with contaminants and CVDs and the chemical forms of Se in foods may influence selenoprotein synthesis. A detailed profile of nutrients and contaminants in Nunavik country foods is also lacking. Using data from the Inuit in Transition Study and samples of country foods, the objectives of this study are to (i): measure new Se biomarkers in archived blood samples and examine their interactions with contaminants and CVD risk factors in adults; (ii) measure nutriments, contaminants and Se chemical forms in country foods. Data will be analysed by a combination of advanced laboratory procedures and statistical modelling. This project will improve the understanding of the role of Se interaction with contaminants and CVDs, and help to maximize benefits and minimize risks from country foods in Nunavik. This research is a collaboration between local stakeholders, community members and scientists; results will be returned and discussed with communities."

In fish and marine mammal eating populations, there is increasing evidence suggesting that high Se intake from diet may play a role in offsetting some deleterious effects of methylmercury exposure. It may also restore Se-enzymes (selenoproteins) inactivated by environmental contaminants. Conversely, in United States and Europe, elevated plasma Se concentrations have been recently associated to type 2 diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and/or hypertension. High contaminant exposures among Inuit populations are also risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), while omega-3 fatty acids (n-3) is a preventive factor for CVD. In addition to plasma Se levels, the most common biomarker of Se status, several new biomarkers (e.g. selenoproteins) have been identified and these may help to better characterise Se interactions with contaminants and the pathways relating Se status to glucose, lipids and insulin metabolism. Using data from the Inuit in Transition Study (n=900), the objectives of this study are to measure new biomarkers of Se in archived blood samples and examine their interactions with contaminants, n-3 and emerging health issues such as diabetes and CVD risk factors in Nunavik adults. New biomarkers of Se will be analysed by combining ion-pair reverse-phase chromatography and affinity chromatography hyphenated to inductively coupled plasma quadrupole mass spectrometry.

The lack of targeted health care and HIV and HCV prevention support services for people who smoke crack is particularly concerning considering the epidemiologic evidence demonstrating escalating engagement in crack smoking and virologic evidence documenting the HIV- and HCV-related risks associated with this practice. Street-involved youth are particularly vulnerable to crack use initiation.  In Ottawa, 64% of street-involved youth reported using crack and/or cocaine without injecting.  
Youth engagement is an essential component of this project, as it is through the knowledge provided by youth that we will create the research tools, develop effective recruitment strategies, appropriately understanding the research findings and design a targeted plan for the dissemination of findings. As such, youth under 25 who have experience with crack (direct or indirect) will be recruited to join the Project Team, which will serve as a working group to inform the research process and ordering of priorities.  As a component of each Project Team meeting, youth will participate in a guided debriefing session in order to provide them with a safe space to share their feelings, reflect on their experiences in the meetings and make suggestions for ways of improving the process.
This study will employ a sequential mixed methods design. We will use qualitative interviews to gather the perspectives of youth who have been identified as holding insight into the particular risk environments occupied by certain groups of youth who smoke crack. This data will inform the development of the quantitative analysis plan and survey tool.   We will then carry out a quantitative survey to document engagement in HIV- and HCV-related risk behaviours and practices that may place youth who smoke crack at risk of HIV and HCV infection."

This supported resilience in service provision, and accelerated a trend towards Virtual Primary Care (VPC) that had already started. But it also raised important policy issues about who can access VPC, and whether it is financially viable and of good quality.

According to recent measures, the policies surrounding VPC are underdeveloped. To fill this gap our team will co-design, with healthcare professionals, patients, and policy-makers, a VPC policy framework. That framework will provide pragmatic policy options in the areas of: system resilience; financial sustainability; effective delivery of high quality care; optimizing the mix of independent fee-for-service and corporate salaried physicians delivering care; and ensuring access for all Canadians. 

Before we can create the framework, we need to answer some questions that will require us to look at quantitative data, as well as conduct qualitative interviews and focus groups. The questions we will answer using these methods are: 1. Are there changes to the way health professionals are licensed that might facilitate VPC across provincial boundaries? 2. Which policies might best ensure virtual care billing codes are appropriately updated? 3. Which policies might best support the delivery of high quality care? 4. Which policies might best optimize the mix of independent and corporately provided VPC? 5. How does the pivot to VPC shape access to care for marginalized Canadians? 6. Which policies might best support improving access to VPC for marginalized Canadians? 

To further help answer these questions, we will share our data with healthcare professionals, patients, and policymakers, inviting them to participate in a consensus-building discussion session. That session will result in a policy framework for decision-makers to use as they prepare for future pandemics and optimize VPC in everyday life."

Research reveals the need for studies that consider immigrant MSM's socio-demographics, sexual risks, and birthplace. Our objective was to examine these in a sample of MSM checkpoint users. 
The study was conducted from July 2012 to November 2014 at Actuel sur Rue (AsR), a Montreal-based HIV checkpoint. Male clients who completed both the counselling and self-administered questionnaires and reported sex with men (MSM) were included in the sample. Men born outside of Canada were considered immigrants. We compared immigrant and non-immigrant MSM's socio-demographics and sexual risks, and considered these by origin, and conducted regression analyses examining how immigrant status and socio-demographics were associated with risk practices.  
During the study period, 1353 MSM visited AsR and 407 (30%) were immigrants, mostly from Europe, Latin America/Caribbean, and Africa/Middle-East. Equal proportions (2%) of immigrant and non-immigrant MSM received a positive rapid HIV-test. Relative to non-immigrant MSM, a greater proportion of immigrant MSM reported a post-secondary degree, a lower income, and being unemployed , while fewer reported receiving an HIV-positive/unknown-status partner's sperm/blood in their mouth, ever having unprotected sex with an HIV-positive partner, and ever having sold sex (p<0.05). In comparisons by origin, fewer Asian and African/Middle-Eastern immigrant MSM reported ever testing for HIV (p<0.05). Immigrant status was not independently associated with sexual risk in regression analyses. MSM who earned less, were unemployed, or had a secondary degree or less were more likely to have sold sex. 
In brief, immigrant status alone does not predict reported sexual risk, unlike socio-demographics. However, efforts are needed to increase access to HIV testing among immigrant MSM, in particular Asian and African/Middle-Eastern MSM."

The study aims to: 1-Deploy and co-optimize WelTel to assist in home monitoring and support of COVID-19 cases and contacts; 2- Determine essential linkages and technical demands of the digital health ecosystem for data security purposes and integration into other electronic health records (EHR) & health information management systems (HIMS); 3-Evaluate communication and other metadata captured by the system for public health quality improvement to better understand and reduce barriers (such as stigma); 4-Use novel computing approaches such as natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to harness artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities to model, predict, and provide insights into future precision public health approaches. 
Collaborators have necessary expert skills in quantitative and qualitative research methods for rigorous assessment, and come from the countries targeted for the research deployment (Canada, UK, US, Kenya, and Rwanda). A rapid digital landscape analysis will also be done as a part of this research.
Virtual care may be an efficient, cost-effective way to provide the necessary public health monitoring and support for patients and contacts of COVID-19 and future emerging communicable pathogens, as well as can inform public health quality improvement and precision care."

Intergenerational cohorts, or studies that begin in pregnancy/gestation and follow infants until they become parents, at which time the second generation of infants is added to the cohort, are needed to address those questions. Human intergenerational cohorts, however, take a lot of time, energy and money to maintain, and because of this they are also rare. Existing long-term studies, such as the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON) study, have already successfully followed large groups of people over more than ten years, from pregnancy to childhood, and so are already half-way to becoming an intergenerational cohort. The APrON Study is also unique in that a diverse range of academics and clinicians are involved, with extensive biological, social, psychological, medical, environmental, developmental and nutrition information collected from mothers, fathers and children. To the best of our knowledge, there are currently no Canadian intergenerational cohorts, and certainly not one with such diverse, in-depth and far-reaching data. The goal of the ""Celebrating Ten Years: APrON Achievements and Evolution"" meeting is to share with the public all that APrON has discovered and accomplished over the last ten years, and to bring together experts that can help APrON plan to become an intergenerational cohort over the next ten years and beyond, including how to attract early career investigators and additional funding. By doing this, we will be in a position to gain valuable and rare information on how the early life experiences of Canadians affects their health from infancy to adulthood, and how health is passed from generation-to-generation - which will be invaluable in guiding creation of health care policy that will help to protect Canadian health for generations to come."

Occupational therapists have developed an evidence-based framework that considers activity patterns that contribute to health and wellness. This framework, entitled Do-Live-Well, represents the foundation for a next generation healthy living guide, offering ways to consider the range of activities and behaviours that contribute to health and well-being and can form the basis of a broad population health promotion strategy. This framework can be adopted by people to consider their behaviours in the context of everyday life, in particular during times of transition in work, health, and living situation. It is consistent with evidence on factors that contribute to successful aging, but application of the framework in the context of healthy aging needs further examination. This project will explore how the framework can be employed at times of life course transition, specifically, at times of retirement, onset of disability, and moving to long term care. This grant will bring together older adults, experts in aging, policy makers from public health and other relevant arenas, to initiate and further plan an integrated knowledge translation project that will focus on how best to apply the Do-Live-Well framework in the context of healthy and successful aging. The project will involve two stakeholder meetings. The first, by webinar, will entail review of the Do-Live-Well framework, and consideration of its application in the context of healthy and successful aging. The second meeting, in person, will focus on development of a research plan, using an Appreciative Inquiry approach. The project will result in a research proposal in which all stakeholders have collaborated on the development of the research question(s) and methodology, identification of appropriate outcome measures, and formulation of plans for analyses and end of grant knowledge translation."
"Investigating the Effects of Interpersonal Feedback on Relation-inferred Self-efficacy, Self-efficacy and Exercise Performance in Young Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder","['Le, Tuyen']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,400347,"Children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) struggle to perform everyday tasks due to coordination difficulties. A recent study found that 5-7 year old children with DCD have poorer performance on exercise tests compared to typically developing (TD) children due to lower confidence in their motor skills. Children's motivation also affects fitness performance. Yet, no research has looked at possible ways to increase confidence and motivation, which in turn could increase their performance on exercise tests. This study will investigate whether positive feedback (""I believe in you"", ""I know you are going to do a lot better than last time"") from a research assistant posed as an athletic trainer can increase children's confidence, motivation, and exercise performance.  

5 participants have completed the study to date (2 TD; 3 DCD). Participants completed questionnaires asking about their confidence and motivation for performing the upcoming exercise tests. About two weeks later they returned to the lab to complete the same questionnaires and exercise tests. However, before completing these measures, some participants received positive feedback from a researcher pretending to be an athletic trainer. Children with DCD did worse on all exercise tests than TD children. There were no differences between groups for confidence and motivation scores; however, DCD children who received positive feedback improved their performance on some exercise tests while DCD children who did not receive feedback did worse at the second appointment. We aim to recruit 50 children with DCD and 50 TD children for this study. 

Initial findings suggest exercise performance in children with DCD may be manipulated to improve performance. Findings from this study will help us find ways to build their confidence for difficult tasks requiring motor coordination and physical effort. Hopefully, this will encourage them to continue playing sports and other physical activities."
Improving cancer treatment-related shared decision-making among older immigrants with cancer,"['Leung, Bonnie C']",['N/A'],"['Cancer Treatment', 'Communication', 'Culturally Specific Needs', 'Decision-Making', 'Equitable Access To Care', 'Health Services Utilization', 'Immigrants', 'Older People']",820.0,475910,"The majority of new cancer diagnoses and cancer-related deaths occur in older people. Almost one third of Canada's ageing population are born outside of Canada. Older people can experience challenges with communication and making treatment-related decisions due to health conditions, such as hearing difficulty or memory loss. For older immigrants, communication and decision-making ability are further challenged by language and cultural barriers. Good communication and shared decision-making can help people with cancer live longer and better. In this doctoral research project, I will examine the factors, processes, and conditions that enable or prevent shared decision-making among older immigrants with their cancer care providers, and create tools to help overcome the identified barriers. I will be working with a patient partner co-lead throughout this project. The project will be divided into three parts. I will first begin by exploring published studies on shared decision-making with culturally and linguistically diverse older people with cancer through a scoping review of the published literature. In the second part of the project, I will conduct interviews with older immigrants living with cancer, their caregivers, and cancer care providers to learn about their experience with shared decision-making as it relates to cancer treatments. For the third part of the project, I will work with patients and caregivers, community groups, and health care providers to develop tools to help older immigrants better take part in shared decision-making with their cancer care. By improving cancer treatment-related shared decision-making with this group of older adults, it will reduce the negative outcomes and differences in cancer care that can occur as a result of poor communication and lack of involvement of patients and their caregivers."

The project's interconnected objectives are three-fold: 1) to implement a Blackfoot-designed program of adopting traditional foods and changing eating behaviour; 2) to evaluate the impact of the program by identifying outcome measures that are meaningful and appropriate to the Blackfoot community; 3) to sustain the program by establishing food sovereignty and security. Indigenous youth are particularly vulnerable to developing diabetes due to the lost of cultural and traditional foods. This study is led by Blackfoot team members, engages the community, and is rooted in Indigenous ways of knowing that are grounded in the specific interests of our partners, collaborators, and knowledge users to improve the health and wellbeing of the community. We will use storytelling style interviews or talking circles, as well as questionnaires to collect information about participants' understanding of diabetes, its risk factors, and its relationship to food and eating habits; their perception of ""decolonizing the body"" by returning to traditional foods/plants; the meaning of food sovereignty and food security; and the preferred methods of learning to change eating habits for youths and parents. Participants will be invited to provide a narrative of their experience prior to the intervention including, but not limited to, their food intake, their housing status, their quality of life, and their experiences accessing culturally appropriate wellness interventions. Indigenous peoples view plants that provide food to the community as more than about sustenance; they view food as medicine, food as a teacher and food as a relative that can unite a community. Combating the rise of diabetes by reconnecting youth to traditional foods and the land means re-establishing sustainable and healthy food systems."

However, many individuals are diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease.  Delayed diagnosis can be attributed to patients' access to healthcare.  Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess the association between the stage of laryngeal cancer at diagnosis and healthcare utilization prior to diagnosis.  This is a retrospective cohort study of patients diagnosed with laryngeal cancer in Ontario.  Data will be obtained from patient charts, cancer registry data, billing data, and hospitalization data.  Associations between the frequency and type of healthcare visits prior to diagnosis and disease stage at diagnosis will be investigated.  This association will be examined separately for the glottic and supraglottic subsites of laryngeal cancer to determine if there are any differences.  In addition, determinants of access to healthcare, such as socioeconomic status, will be investigated for their effects on the associations between healthcare utilization and stage at diagnosis.  Understanding healthcare utilization among patients diagnosed with laryngeal cancer is important for the prevention of delayed diagnosis.  Identifying the patterns of healthcare utilization that contribute to late stage diagnosis will allow steps to be taken to improve screening for laryngeal cancers.  These changes will result in earlier diagnosis of laryngeal cancers and will lead to improved outcomes and survival among patients."
Population-based comparison of two regimens for emergency contraception: a pharmacoepidemiologic study,"['Leung, Vivian W']",['N/A'],"['Clinical Research', 'Contraception', 'Outcomes Research', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Public Health', 'Statistical Modeling', 'Therapeutics', ""Women'S Health""]",105000.0,184733,"Unwanted pregnancy frequently leads women to seek abortion. In British Columbia, 14,000-16,000 abortion procedures are performed each year, representing 25-28% of all pregnancies. Hormonal emergency contraceptives (ECs), also known as ""morning after pills,"" can prevent pregnancy before it starts and have the potential to lower the abortion rate. The most commonly used ECs are: (1) the Yuzpe regimen (containing estrogen and progestin), and (2) the progestin-only levonorgestrel regimen. In Canada and the United States, the levonorgestrel regimen is available without a prescription and is widely considered by members of the clinical and scientific communities to be more effective than the Yuzpe regimen, even though it has not consistently been shown to be more effective in clinical studies.

In December 2000, the provincial government in British Columbia expanded women's access to ECs by granting pharmacists authority to prescribe them. Women who sought ECs from pharmacists provided written consent for treatment on standardized consent forms. Using a process that ensures the women's anonymity, we have linked the information from over 8000 forms to corresponding prescription records in the provincial prescription database and other health databases containing diagnostic information. The linkage will allow us to compare the effectiveness of the two ECs based on the frequency of abortion and other pregnancy-related events among women who received each regimen from pharmacists in the community. In addition, we will study utilization patterns of ECs and oral contraceptives in clinics and physicians' offices. The proposed investigation is designed to study the health outcomes of ECs on a larger scale than ever before. Therefore, the results will enrich the body of research in this area and better inform women and health professionals on optimal EC use."

These couples are inevitably faced with many uncertainties that require multiple adjustments in their relationship roles and future expectations. Research also reveals that couples frequently report that they have gotten closer and felt stronger after struggling with cancer together. These positive psychological changes have been termed post-traumatic growth (PTG). Currently, a research study titled 'Managing Cancer and Living Meaningfully (CALM)' has been conducted at the Princess Margaret Hospital to assist advanced cancer patients and their spouses. No study has yet examined PTG among only the spouses of advanced cancer patients. As an extension of CALM study, the proposed study will assess: 1) the impact of CALM intervention on adjustment, 2) the prevalence and nature of PTG, and 3) the factors contributing to successful adjustment among the spouses of advanced cancer patients. We hypothesize that greater PTG in the spouses is linked to older age, more attachment security and marital satisfaction, participation in the CALM intervention, and greater PTG of their spouses. Objective 1 and 2 will be fulfilled by in-depth interviews. Interviews will continue until no new information is found. Objective 3 will be fulfilled by two surveys, one before and one after the intervention. These surveys assess PTG and distress, and perceived support from healthcare professionals, attachment security, and marital satisfaction. Based on a previous study, 96 participants will be required for the treatment and control groups to detect a minimal difference. The responses will be compared across a 3-month period and between the spouses in the treatment and those in the control groups using basic and multivariate statistics. The proposed study will gain insight on how CALM improves spousal adjustment near the end-of-life."

This phenomenon, referred to as post-traumatic growth (PTG), includes increased closeness to family and appreciation of life. Within my study, I will use various cardiac samples to 1) summarize the current evidence on the effects of PTG on mortality and morbidity among CAD patients; 2) explore the characteristics of CAD outpatients who reported PTG 1 year after diagnosis; and 3) assess the impacts of PTG on mortality and re-admission rates in CAD inpatients. Study 1 will entail a literature search from multiple databases to generate a meta-analysis. Study 2 will involve data from a completed prospective study of 1490 CAD outpatients. Participants responded to mailed baseline and follow-up surveys, which assess the level of PTG and its potential correlates. Clinical data were extracted from charts. Study 2 will be conducted through an on-going study of 2240 CAD inpatients. At baseline, patients will fill out a survey assessing their characteristics and CAD risk factors. At 1 year, patients' level of PTG will be assessed. At 3 years, patients' records of re-admission and mortality will be obtained from administrative databases for survival analysis based on PTG level. My work will contribute a novel angle to the current knowledge concerned with human strengths for adaptation to CAD.

Mobility and social participation are key determinants of many favourable health and quality of life outcomes. Mobility is broadly defined as the ability to move oneself (walking, taking transportation, etc.) within community environments that expand from one's home, to the neighbourhood, and to regions beyond. Social participation represents a person's involvement in social activities that provide social interactions within his/her community or society. As they are both outcomes amenable to change, it is important to identify the factors that influence mobility and social participation. Although the influence of neighbourhood environment on mobility and social participation has been studied in various disciplines, no attempt has been made to develop a comprehensive portrait that systematically integrates the results of these diverse studies. However, such a synthesis could lead to a better understanding of how neighbourhood environment influences mobility and social participation in older adults. This study aims to synthesize and disseminate current knowledge on how neighbourhood environment influences mobility and social participation in older adults.

To address the challenges of the global aging population, the World Health Organization promoted age-friendly communities as a way to foster the development of active aging community initiatives. Accordingly, key components, i.e., policies, services and structures related to the communities' physical and social environments, should be designed to be age-friendly and help all aging adults to live safely, enjoy good health and stay involved in their communities. Although age-friendly communities are believed to be one of the best ways to help aging Canadians lead healthy and active lives, little is known about which key components best foster positive health, social participation and health equity, and how.
Objectives
The general objective of this proposal is to better understand which and how key components of age-friendly communities best foster positive health, social participation and health equity in aging Canadians. Specifically, the research aims to:
1)Describe and compare age-friendly key components of communities across Canada
2)Identify key components best associated with positive health, social participation and health equity of aging adults 
3)Explore how these key components foster positive health, social participation and health equity
Method
A mixed-method sequential explanatory design will be used. The quantitative part will involve a survey of selected Canadian communities and secondary analysis of cross-sectional data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. In the qualitative part, a multiple case study will be conducted in five Canadian communities performing best on positive health, social participation and health equity.
Expectations
Building on new and existing collaborations and generating evidence from real-world interventions, the results of this project will help age-friendly communities to identify policies, services and structures which foster positive health, social participation and health equity at a population level."

It is thought that, as Canadian children spend a large part of their lives in schools, availability of foods high in sugar, fat, and salt in schools has contributed to this epidemic.
 
To address this critical public health issue, a number of provinces have developed guidelines around what foods should and should not be available for children in public schools. British Columbia (BC) has released an updated set of guidelines to be fully in place in schools by the fall of 2014. Each school board and school has a significant amount of freedom to choose how they meet the nutritional guidelines.

This study will focus on 1) ways in which Vancouver public schools, each with their own unique setting, are meeting the guidelines, and 2) how parents, students and other key school staff perceive the new guidelines to gain a better understanding of ways schools can be supported to ensure availability of healthy foods for students. Specific cases of Vancouver public schools and their progress towards meeting the nutritional guidelines will be examined. I will collect information from key people involved in the development of the guidelines, school administrators, decision-makers, school staff, parents, students, and through spending significant time at each school. The overall aim of this project is to provide insight for municipal and provincial decision-makers into what strategies to improve availability of healthy foods in schools will likely be successful. Only by determining what is working and the challenges schools face in adhering to the nutritional guidelines can this type of intervention serve its full potential and be effective both for children now and in their futures. This research will not only be informative for British Columbia but also for other provinces hoping to develop or improve their own nutritional guidelines."

Even now, more than five years after the programs began, the controversy continues. This study is based in Ontario, where the HPV vaccine has been offered free-of-charge to all Grade 8 girls since September 2007. The study will include all girls in Grade 8 in 2007/08-2010/11 (eligible for free vaccination) and 2003/2004-2006/2007 (ineligible for free vaccination). We will create a similar cohort of Grade 8 boys. Data for this study will come entirely from the province's administrative health and immunization databases, which contain secure, anonymous information on all individuals covered under Ontario's Health Insurance Plan. Using this information, we will answer questions of particular public interest - for example: (1) To what extent does vaccinating girls in Grade 8 girls reduce their risk of getting genital warts? (2) Has HPV vaccination led to an increase in teen pregnancies or sexually transmitted infections (excluding warts)? and (3) Does vaccinating girls decrease the occurrence of genital warts in boys? To ensure the accuracy of our results, we will also be undertaking a re-abstraction study to validate our outcome definitions. The results of our study will help young girls and their parents make more educated decisions about HPV vaccination.

Although provinces have directed their HPV vaccination programs at different school grades, girls receiving this vaccine are generally much younger than those included in clinical trials. In addition, parental concerns about the vaccine's safety have proven to be an important barrier to use in some provinces, reaching a low of 50 percent in Ontario. Such low levels of uptake are of concern not only because they are detrimental to public health efforts aimed at reducing the burden of HPV-related diseases, but also because they undermine the cost-effectiveness of HPV immunization programs. Given these concerns, it is important to evaluate the safety and usage of this vaccine in the young girls being vaccinated. This study will use anonymized information from Ontario's health and immunization databases to identify over 250,000 Grade 8 girls eligible for the province's HPV immunization program between 2007 and 2010. This information will be used to evaluate the risk of serious adverse events following vaccination and assess the pattern and predictors of vaccine use. The results of this study will help young girls and their parents make informed decisions about vaccinating against HPV, and will inform policy makers regarding ways to maximize the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of HPV immunization programs."

Other medications that provide some pain relief and improve quality of life include some antidepressants, anti-epileptics, and narcotics. However, there is evidence to suggest that these pain medications may increase the risk of heart disease. Given the increasing number of older persons at higher risk of heart disease that are also taking these pain medications, it is important to evaluate the safety of these medications. In this study, we will use anonymized information from Québec's health care databases to identify a group of older adults that have been diagnosed with pain related to nerve disease. We will compare the risk of heart failure, heart attacks, and irregular heart beat in users of various pain medications with that of non-users of these medications. This population-based study will contribute valuable information about the relative safety of the various pain medications that are used in routine practice. The results of this study will enable older adults and their doctors to make informed decisions about the use of pain medications in order to exploit the benefits of these medications while minimizing their potential for harm."

Communities have turned inwards and enforced strong prevention measures, such as complete community lockdowns and border checkpoints. Interactions with outside health systems have led to some highly publicized incidents of racism. This is a timely opportunity to study Indigenous community mobilization for health in a way that explicitly accounts for Canada's colonial history. This research topic was developed from community interests and concerns. We will use a community engaged approach to research in which community decision making  and research involvement are prioritized.  Specifically, this project will address the research questions:  What are the drivers and impacts related to community mobilization in the context of COVID-19? How can community mobilization for an emergency pandemic response be leveraged to address the long term wholistic health consequences of the pandemic?  How has systemic racism, access to care and confidence in science impacted communities' mobilization response to COVID-19? Methods will include document review, Grounded Theory, modified Talking Circles, and In-depth Interviews and will be guided by the social-ecological model and Historical Trauma Theory. Findings from this research will  inform the creation or adjustment of ongoing COVID-19 responses and identify levers to supporting trust in public health/science within First Nations communities."

Pictou Landing First Nation (PLFN) was exposed to effluent from a pulp and paper mill for over 50 years, until the mill was forced to close in 2020. Government reported that PLFN's health was not impacted by exposures, but their concerns would not go away. In 2010, we (PLFN and NPA) co-designed a project to assess the health status of PLFN using Statistics Canada data and other quantitative data. We used oral histories from Knowledge Holders in PLFN which highlighted their unique relationship to land and developed a Mi'kmaw environmental health framework to analyze the data which revealed governments' failures. PLFNs experience underscores the need for community centered/controlled approaches to environmental health risk assessment, governance and data. Our proposed research will examine health impacts of living near oil and gas extraction (Cree, Chipewyan (Dene), and Métis) and a landfill site (Haudenosaunee), and work with each of the four ICs to co-develop their own environmental health frameworks to show how community-led/locally relevant/culturally safe governance frameworks and cultural protocols ensure the highest ethical standards are followed and promote community health decisions that respect Indigenous values and traditions. We will support community-led environmental health literacy efforts to build capacity and learning for ICs and address impacts of current/proposed development affecting the four ICs. Finally, we will critique existing state-led environmental health risk assessment (EHRA) methodologies. Guided by Etuaptmumk (Two-Eyed Seeing), using a community-based participatory approach and the Mi'kmaw framework as a starting point we will advance the capacity of ICs to develop Indigenous EHRA to assess their own health and environmental status and share our research widely to show how Indigenous-led assessments result in more effective decisions."

Women and their children exposed to gestational diabetes are at higher risk for developing diabetes later in life. We know that healthy diet and exercise improve sugar metabolism, but we do not know whether lifestyle and/or genetics have a role in the progression of diabetes among those affected by gestational diabetes. We also do not know whether affected women's lifestyle choices after the childbirth have an impact on risk of obesity and diabetes in their children.  We aim to study whether lifestyle and/or genetics are related to the progression from gestational diabetes to diabetes later in life. We will also study whether affected women's lifestyle choices after the childbirth have an impact on risk of obesity in their children.  We will test our objectives within longitudinal research studies following women for over 20 years. The Nurses' Health Study II is an ongoing study following 116,430 female nurses. Women are asked to report their medical and lifestyle information every other year. They also donate blood and urine samples to test genetic and biomarkers. We assembled women with a history of gestational diabetes to test our research questions. We are also following their children through Growing-Up Today Study (GUTS) and GUTS-II and collecting children's growth information.  In current practices, women are only advised to monitor blood sugar levels during the first year after the pregnancy affected by gestational diabetes and are offered no lifestyle advice beyond the pregnancy. Our proposed study will assist in finding risk factors for diabetes and in developing diabetes prevention strategies specific to these high risk young women and their children."

CAAT's multi-disciplinary community-academic research team engaged PHAs and faith, media and social justice leaders from Black, Asian and Latin American communities in Toronto to study this problem. We found that homophobia and the lack of visible presence of PHAs within these communities sustain stigma and denial.  This undermines HIV/AIDS prevention efforts and heightens discrimination against ethno-racial PHAs. It also highlights the need to mobilize PHA and other community champions to address HIV/AIDS-related stigma within these communities. This study will pilot and test two interventions with potential to mobilize community champions as key agents to advance HIV/AIDS work. Social Justice Capacity Building training (SJCB) is based on the principles of empowerment education and skills development and has been used widely to engage communities in addressing their health issues. However, since HIV/AIDS-related stigma impedes the extent to which affected communities can fully utilize SJCB to address HIV issues in their communities, this project will also pilot and test the use of SJCB in conjunction with Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT). ACT is a psychological intervention which has shown potential for addressing stigma, but it has not been tested in the context of HIV/AIDS-related stigma. Using a pre- and post-test design, 30 PHAs and 30 community leaders will participate in one of two intervention programs: (1) SJCB only; or (2) ACT plus SJCB. This study will test the effectiveness of using SJCB and ACT to increase participants' readiness to act as champions to reduce HIV/AIDS-related stigma in the target communities. Study results will inform HIV prevention efforts in the target ethno-racial communities disproportionately affected by HIV."

Research studies on East and Southeast Asian MSM confirmed that they have comparable high risk sexual behaviors, risk factors, as well as prevalence of drug use as MSM of other races and ethnicities. However, epidemiological data from HIV and AIDS cases in Ontario has shown low HIV prevalence rate in the East and Southeast Asian MSM population in proportion to their overall population size (Remis, 2010). Research gaps in HIV research on East and Southeast Asian MSM make it difficult to gain a clear sense of the contributing factors to their overall lower rate of HIV infection and on their pathways they undertake to navigate through major life challenges, access support, and build resiliency to overcome barriers. 

Key project activities are 1) develop a multi-disciplinary research team to refine project objectives and design, and engage in capacity building activities to build research and health promotion skills; 2) conduct a literature review on relevant research on resiliency to the context of HIV prevention and health promotion, and on theoretical frameworks, research methodologies that will help us to document the pathways and capture lessons learned from the transformative impact of these experiences; 3) conduct 6 focus groups with East and Southeast Asian MSM and service providers to learn from their experiences and perspectives on how they negotiate various life challenges, what affects their access to services and support, and also from their suggestions on services and referrals.

Support for Organ and Tissue Donation among New Canadians: A Population-Based Study,"['Li, Alvin H']",['N/A'],"['Biostatistics', 'Epidemiology', 'Immigrant Health', 'Multi-Level Modelling', 'Organ And Tissue Donation', 'Regression Modeling']",105000.0,307835,"In 2012, 3404 Canadians were waiting for a solid organ transplant. The transplant community is now searching for solutions to meet this growing demand for organs. One possible solution is to increase the number of individuals registering their commitment to organ and tissue donation through an organ donor registry. Currently, 22% of eligible Ontarians have registered in their provincial registry. However, registration rates varies province wide. Communities in Northern Ontario have up to 50% of their population registered but large cities such as Toronto, Richmond Hill and Markham have much lower registration rates (13%, 11% and 9% respectively). Existing literature has found that certain ethnic groups and foreign-born individuals have low donor registration rates due to unawareness of organ transplantation or uncertainty about their religion's stance on organ donation. The transplant community attributes without evidence that the low registration values in these communities is due to the high proportion of immigrants. Therefore, this study will establish the truth of this statement. Specifically, the goal of my research is to determine the number of organ donor registrants among over one million immigrants to Ontario from various countries, compare the donor registration rates among immigrants with long-term residents in Ontario and examine the association of donor registration with age, sex, income, time spent in Canada, country of birth and other socio-demographic factors. I hypothesize that: (1) Organ donor registration among immigrants is low (2) Immigrants are less likely to register compared to long-term residents (3) An individual's country of birth and time spent in Canada will be the strongest predictor of being a donor registrant. This project is unique that we will be linking large administrative databases using encrypted identifiers held at the Institute of Clinical Evaluative Sciences."
Interventions to increase organ and tissue donor registration in physician offices,"['Li, Alvin H']",['N/A'],"['Cluster Randomized Trial', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Organ Donation']",135000.0,338654,"One organ donor can save up to 8 lives. Unfortunately, many Canadians die while waiting for a transplant because there are not enough available organs. Canadians are encouraged to register to donate their organs; however less than 25% of the public in most provinces have registered. Based on previous research, we identified that targeting patients attending family physician offices could increase organ and tissue donation for multiple reasons: 1) they are a trusted source for information; 2) patients have their health card number readily available to register for organ donation; 3) patients are ready to think about health issues and wellbeing while in the waiting room. Working together with Trillium Gift of Life Network (Ontario's organ procurement organization), my program of research aims to plan, develop and test an intervention in physician offices to increase organ and tissue donor registration (OTDR). The ultimate goal of this research is to create and evaluate an intervention that can increase the number of individuals registered for organ donation, thereby decreasing the number of individuals waiting for an organ waitlist."
Circulating Toxin and Common Cancer Risk: A Mendelian Randomization Approach,"['Liang, Kevin']",['N/A'],"['Bioinformatics', 'Cancer Risk Predictions', 'Cancer Screening', 'Cancers', 'Genetic Epidemiology', 'Human Genetics', 'Toxin']",105000.0,460903,"Whether it be in the food we eat, the water we drink, or the things we encounter daily, toxins (e.g., lead, cadmium, and BPA) in varying amounts and kinds are often ingested. As such, regardless of our lifestyles, we all have some amount of circulating toxins. Despite the ubiquitous nature of toxin exposure, there is limited research into determining if they are causally linked to increased cancer risks. The reason is two-fold. Firstly, for ethical reasons, human studies in this area are largely dominated by observational data which can be strongly affected by biases introduced through confounding factors such as lifestyle. Secondly, animal and cellular model studies often have had poor translation to human outcomes.

My research project aims to overcome both limitations by utilizing an established technique known as Mendelian Randomization (MR) applied to data collected through the Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS). The CHMS is a federally led project that currently has standardized toxin data from over 13,000 Canadians. MR, sometimes known as ""nature's randomized control trial"", is a powerful alternative to the gold standard, the double-blind randomized controlled trial, to assess the causal role of toxins and cancer risk. MR makes use of the fact that all toxins, once enter the body, are processed by various proteins and due to natural variations in our DNA, our ability in doing so differs between people. This means that simply because of genetics, some people are naturally prone to higher levels of circulating toxins. Since our genetics are determined at birth, they are independent of common confounding factors. Using these genetic determinants of toxin levels as statistical instruments, I will use MR to test if a causal relationship between toxin exposure and cancer risk exists. Such information will help us better understand which toxins should be avoided and will help to shape future public health policies to reduce the cancer burden in Canada."

This also reflects the reality in Kaska communities in Yukon territory where violence is crippling the health of the individuals, families and communities. Services, resources and tools that are culturally relevant and respond appropriately to issues of violence are limited and under-resourced across northern remote communities. 

Liard Aboriginal Women's Society (LAWS) proposes to develop, pilot, publish, and deliver a community-based Youth Empowerment Handbook and Training Series. LAWS is a non-profit, community-based, Indigenous organization that provides social development services to the five Kaska Nation communities in the Yukon and northern British Columbia. 

This hands-on practical guide and curriculum will document the best practices, theory, methods, resources, and exercises. The purpose of this phase will be to explore our assumption that culturally relevant, response-based and dignity-informed tools will build a core foundation of Indigenous Youth capacity to mobilize and address gender-based violence and interconnected health and wellness challenges in their communities. This funding will support us to research the issues facing our Kaska Youth and their needs with regards to capacity building tools. Planning will be designed in collaboration with Indigenous Youth champions, community members, Elders, and agency representatives that work with Indigenous Youth in a health-related capacity.

This includes being more likely to have cervical cancer, and more likely to have complications in pregnancy. Having better healthcare could make a difference: women who are in prison or have been in prison are less likely to get routine Pap tests to screen for cervical cancer, and are less likely to get basic prenatal care. Although it is clear that women experiencing imprisonment need better healthcare, we do not know how to most effectively achieve this.

On October 1st, 2017, in effort to improve healthcare in provincial prisons British Columbia (BC) transferred responsibility for prison healthcare from the Ministry of Public Safety and the Solicitor General to the Ministry of Health. But, we do not know if this change has actually made a difference to improve women's health specifically.

We will determine whether transferring responsibility for healthcare to the Ministry of Health improved healthcare for women experiencing imprisonment in BC by looking at two key markers: whether eligible women received routine Pap tests to screen for cervical cancer, and whether women who were pregnant received basic prenatal care. We will compare the rates of receiving this care before and after responsibility for healthcare in provincial prisons was transferred to the Ministry of Health. We will also compare these BC rates to rates of the same healthcare markers in Ontario during the same time period, where no change in responsibility has occurred and the Ministry of the Solicitor General is still responsible for healthcare in provincial prisons. 

Evaluating the impact of this change can help us understand how to improve healthcare for women who experience imprisonment in BC and around the world."

Wellness Within provides and advocates for health services in addition to conducting research; so, people with lived experiences, healthcare workers, and policy makers all contribute to research which directly addresses specific healthcare and policy needs. However, an identified gap in these activities is expertise to use 'natural experiments' to measure how effective specific policies/programs actually are in improving health. These analyses are crucial to help us understand which policies/programs should be expanded, and how to concentrate our efforts to meaningfully improve the health of women & gender-diverse people experiencing incarceration in Canada. 

We will extend Wellness Within's work by bringing together: 1) people with lived experiences and community organizations who know what the important health policies/programs are across Canada, and 2) researchers with expertise in measuring the impact of health policies using population data and natural experiments. 

We will: 
1)Figure out which policies/programs to improve reproductive health in people experiencing incarceration need better evaluation and how to best design these studies, 
2)Invite people with lived experiences, community organizations, and researchers to prioritize the policies/programs which most urgently need better evaluation, or are well supported by evidence and need to be implemented, and

Moreover, food security programs often lack in addressing Indigenous context within their plan guidelines. This program of research will evaluate and expand emergency food security and mental wellbeing programs in Miawpukek First Nation (MFN), under the guidance of the Health Director, Ada John. 

Our program of research has three objectives. First, to accelerate the development of wellbeing programming that connects food security, Indigenous Knowledge and wellbeing. Second, to evaluate the stress levels of residents in real-time to determine how impactful food asset initiatives and wellbeing interventions are while enduring a pandemic, and third, to assess how these recently acquired food assets contributed to food security, food sovereignty, and wellbeing during a pandemic and their potential as a long-term strategy within a remote First Nation community. 

The research program will implement traditional Indigenous food security practices and expand the existing MFN food asset initiatives to include health and wellbeing interventions to mitigate long and short-term pandemic-related stress. This would be achieved by accelerating the development of social programming that connects food security, co-designing the program using Two-Eyed Seeing practices, and evaluating the wellbeing (stress levels) of residents to determine the impact of food asset initiatives and wellbeing interventions while enduring a pandemic. Furthermore, we will also assess how these food assets contribute to long-term food security, food sovereignty, and wellbeing within a remote First Nation community by developing a best-practices framework for expansion to other communities."

Smartphones, with multiple capabilities including the ability to run applications, or apps, have become especially popular. The popularity and full-day access of smartphones and their apps offers an exciting opportunity to develop and test state-of-the-art approaches to track dietary intake and support positive dietary change. This is especially needed at a time when poor nutrition (e.g., excess caloric intakes leading to obesity) is responsible for a high incidence of preventable chronic diseases (e.g., heart disease and diabetes) in Canadians. Research in this area is novel, timely and crucial for the public, dietitians, government, and industry as it is important to ensure that nutrition apps are safe (as no regulations currently exist), understandable and effective.

This study will examine the readability, reliability, and currency of newly available smartphone nutrition apps from app stores aimed at the general public. Following this, consumer research will be conducted to better understand user experiences with current nutrition apps. This will be investigated through interviews with individuals who have used newly available nutrition apps, and designing and implementing a survey for current users of a national web based food and exercise tracking system. These results will be used to design a nutrition app for consumers followed by pre-testing and pilot testing. This new app will then be implemented amongst a large group of current smartphone users to test behavior change. Feedback on application usability and satisfaction will be obtained using surveys and interviews. This research will help to ensure better quality assurance of nutritional apps, will inform dietitians of new treatment options to use in their practice and will provide Canadians with an easy to use and accessible tool to help them make better nutrition choices."
Using a Brief Psychological Intervention to Facilitate Social Integration and Improve Mental Health Among Mostly Heterosexual Young Adults During the Transition Into College,"['Li, Gu']",['N/A'],"['Health Disparities', 'Mostly Heterosexual', 'Psychological Intervention', 'Sexual Orientation', 'Sexuality']",90000.0,376031,"Despite their invisibility, mostly heterosexual (MH) people outnumber the sum of gay, lesbian, and bisexual people. MH refers to heterosexual people who sometimes have same-sex sexuality. It is estimated that 11-16% of women and 2-6% of men are MH, and that this proportion peaks in young adults.

To date, no research has studied MH young adults in Canada. Alarmingly, however, MH people in the U.S. report more mental disorders than exclusively heterosexual (EH) people. This finding suggests that in Canada, there is likely a large group of young adults being overlooked by health researchers and professionals.

In two studies, I propose to (1) investigate the mental health of MH first-year college students, for the first time in Canada, and (2) facilitate social integration and reduce mental health problems among them, using a brief online psychological intervention. Study 1 will prospectively examine mental health disparities between MH and EH first-year college students, as well as the underlying roles of social integration and internalized homophobia. Study 2 will use a one-session online video intervention, adapted from prior successful self-affirmation interventions, to ease transition into college and to narrow the mental health gap of MH young adults.

The findings from this research can be used to develop healthcare policies and allocate resources to a disadvantaged group of Canadians who have been previously underrepresented. Our psychological intervention has the potential to reduce mental health disparities in stigmatized Canadians who experience same-sex sexuality."

However, our recent survey in British Columbia found only 1 in 4 people with mild osteoarthritis symptoms (pain; stiffness) met the recommended level of physical activity. Research in people without arthritis shows that web-based tools can increase walking behaviour, but none of these tools are designed with the needs of people with arthritis in mind. Research in other chronic diseases has found that people are more likely to quit smoking shortly after the diagnosis of a smoking-related disease. Thus, the diagnosis of osteoarthritis presents an ideal 'teachable moment' to engage those who have been sedentary to become physically active.

This project will address the Research Question: Can an interactive website increase physical activity in people with previously undiagnosed early knee osteoarthritis? The website, called OPEN (Osteoarthritis Physical Activity & Exercise Net), will be created based on a well developed behavioural theory. We will then recruit 252 sedentary people with early knee osteoarthritis in British Columbia to test the website. Half of them will be assigned to use the OPEN website for 3 months and will receive an education pamphlet produced by The Arthritis Society; the other half will only receive the pamphlet. During the test period, participants will complete online questionnaires at 0, 3 and 6 months to allow us to follow changes in physical activity, knee symptoms and outcomes related to their motivation to become physically active. We will also compare changes between the two groups.

Our project directly targets physical inactivity at a time when the joint damage tends to be mild, and when people are more motivated to adopt a healthy behaviour.  If the OPEN is found to be effective in improving physical activity, it opens further opportunities to promote early diagnosis and to implement lifestyle interventions."
Liver Toxicity Monitoring in Users of Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs: Use of Real-World Data to Examine Patient Safety Errors and Predict Adverse Events,"['li, lingyi']",['N/A'],"['Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs', 'Elevated Liver Enzymes', 'Inflammatory Arthritis', 'Liver Toxicity Monitoring', 'Machine Learning', 'Patient Safety Errors', 'Population-Based Study', 'Real-World Data']",150000.0,492740,"Inflammatory arthritis (IA) affects approximately 3 of every 100 Canadians. This condition results from immune dysfunction, leading to damage to organs and joints. Consequently, patients may experience disability, loss of work, pain, fatigue, and even premature death.  To prevent such damage and potential early death, all IA patients require disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).

However, these medications can have adverse effects on the liver. A key indicator of this is a change in liver enzymes, which may signal potential liver damage. Regularly monitoring these enzymes in the blood is crucial to initiate timely treatments, prevent severe problems, and reduce both health resource usage and healthcare costs. Despite its importance, there is limited research on the frequency of missed liver enzyme checks. Regardless of whether monitoring is conducted, having a predictive tool to assess the future risk of liver damage would be invaluable to both clinicians and patients.

Our study has two main goals. 1) Understanding Monitoring Gaps: We want to see how often liver checks are missed. We suspect that many IA patients will have some missed checks, but males with lower income, more severe diseases, or living far from their doctors might miss more. 2) Predicting Liver Problems: We're comparing two methods to predict changes in liver enzymes. One uses traditional statistical techniques, and the other uses advanced computer techniques called machine learning. We believe the machine learning method might be better because it can handle complex information more effectively. We will use a massive health database that contains information from over 2.5 million patients. We hope our findings will make it safer for those taking DMARDs. Our research will 1) identify any shortcomings in current liver health monitoring practices for DMARD users; and 2) determine if computerized tools can assist doctors in providing personalized advice about potential risks to IA patients."

A quantitative analysis using a national secondary data set will be conducted. The General Social Survey (GSS) Cycle 26: Caregiving and Care Receiving (2012) will be used as the database. Data related to employed family caregivers will be extracted and analyzed using bivariate and multivariate analyses. These results will serve as empirical evidence for relevant stakeholders, particularly for policy makers and service providers in providing necessary support for employed caregiver in community and workplace."
The health trajectory of older immigrants: Inter- and intra-group analyses based on the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging,"['Li, Lun']","['Duan, Yinfei', 'Lee, Yeonjung', 'Wister, Andrew V']","['Healthy Aging', 'Life Course', 'Older Immigrant']",63308.0,491568,"Older immigrants constitute one-third of aging Canadians. The health of older immigrants is critical to Canada's healthcare and social service system. Healthy immigrant effect is a well-known phenomenon indicating the advanced health of immigrants than their native-born counterparts in host countries. However, the healthy immigrant effect has been challenged by paradoxical findings based on long-term or older immigrants. This project proposes to capture the long-term health trajectory of older immigrants over time, and focus on the impact of life stage at migration on health changes. Guided by the stress process model and life course theory, three waves of data (2011-2021) collected by the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) will be used. 
The CLSA data, including Baseline, Follow-up 1, and Follow-up 2 will be used. Studied variables include physical, functional and mental health indicators, migration-related factors, social-demographic information, family and social relationship factors, and health-related behaviours, etc. Linear mixed models will be applied to conduct longitudinal data analyses to: 1) assess the health trajectories of older immigrants over time, and explore the variations of long-term health change based on life stage at migration; 2) examine the inter-group (older immigrants and Canadian-born older adults) and intra-group (old immigrants and middle-aged immigrants) health disparities over time, and 3) establish the associations between health outcomes and other factors concurrently and longitudinally. 
This project is of great salience considering the predicted growing size of older immigrants in Canada, as well as the fact that older immigrants face multiple challenges to maintain good health. The findings will contribute to a better understanding of the health changes of older immigrants over time, as well as inform the policymaking and service delivery to facilitate healthy, active, and successful aging for immigrants."
Linking psychological factors with clinical disease: The role of glucocorticoid sensitivity,"['Lim, Alvin']",['N/A'],"['Genetics And Genomics', 'Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis', 'Inflammation', 'Psychobiology Of Health', 'Psychosocial Stress']",105000.0,257486,"Mounting evidence has suggested psychological factors, including chronic life stress and low social status, increase the risk of mortality to several clinical diseases including heart disease, stroke, and certain forms of cancer. These findings have raised an interesting question on how stressful life experiences ""get under the skin"" to influence physical health. Currently, there is speculation that sensitivity to cortisol--a hormone released during stressful experiences that suppresses immune activity--may influence physical disease. My previous research in this area found that individuals reared in disadvantaged households possess hyper-vigilant immune systems that no longer respond to cortisol. This elevated state of immune activity is strong risk-factor for heart disease, age-related declines in mental functioning, and diabetes.
To further advance knowledge in this area, I have proposed two projects that will examine the biological determinants of cortisol sensitivity. In one project, I will examine how a certain gene in the cortisol receptor may predispose individuals to developing resistance to cortisol, which may in turn increase their risk for clinical disease. In the other project, I will examine how chronic life stressors influence the intracellular mechanisms involved in conveying cortisol's immunosuppressive actions. Together, these projects will enable me to investigate how biological changes that accompany psychological stress may increase risk for clinical disease."

Note that these diseases do not only affect IDUs. For example, the US launched a campaign in 2012 to test ""baby boomers"" given they have been exposed to HCV in the past; they calculated that 1 in 30 ""baby boomers"" are unaware of being infected with HCV. Also in the US, it was calculated that 21% of individuals infected with HIV are unaware of their infection. In Canada, especially in British Columbia (BC), the situation is very similar. Unfortunately, there is neither a preventive HCV vaccine nor a preventive vaccine or a cure for HIV. Currently, the treatment for HCV is very complicated, associated with a high occurrence of side-effects and a low cure rate. Among individuals infected with both HCV and HIV, the management of their diseases is further complicated, and they are at a higher risk of mortality. Based on the success of using the ""HIV Treatment as Prevention"" strategy to decrease the burden and transmission of HIV, we propose to evaluate a parallel ""HCV Treatment as Prevention"" strategy to decrease the combined burden of HIV and HCV and, secondarily, to decrease the spread of both HIV and HCV. This proposal will develop a methodology to forecast the future of both HCV and HIV epidemics in BC, considering different scenarios of testing, treatment coverage and retention into treatment for both diseases. There is no time to wait for the ""perfect regimen"" or a vaccine that will prevent HCV and HIV. Many lives will be saved if we act expeditiously taking advantage of the currently used and newly approved drugs. Failure to do so will lead to avoidable healthcare costs and further stress to healthcare systems already struggling to cope with the existing demand."

Since 2004, in British Columbia (BC), the proportion of new diagnoses among MSM have plateaued, while those of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), especially syphilis, have been rapidly increasing, consistent with a substantial level of condomless anal intercourse. Today, there are three powerful strategies available to prevent HIV infection among MSM, including: the use of condoms, treatment as prevention (TasP), and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). In this 5-year study, our key contribution will be to develop a new methodology to forecast the consequences and benefits of emerging programs and policies for HIV and STI prevention among MSM prior to their implementation. This methodology will provide a deep understanding of the heterogeneity in sexual practices within MSM networks over time, enabling a more accurate assessment of the impact of different interventions targeting these networks. The proposed analyses accounts for the role of key factors affecting HIV and STI transmission among MSM, including demographic (e.g., age, income level), psychosocial (e.g., substance abuse, history of partner violence, childhood sexual abuse), and health-related factors (e.g., health status). Our ability to confidentially link administrative databases of all people diagnosed with HIV and at risk of acquiring HIV in BC, and assess surveillance testing data, makes this one of the first interdisciplinary research studies of how co-occurring STIs and risk behaviour are fuelling the HIV epidemic within MSM sexual networks. Importantly, this study will provide highly relevant new information for decision makers to inform resource prioritization and policies as they address the future impact of HIV, STIs and utilization of healthcare resources by HIV infected MSM in BC, Canada and internationally."

However, it is known that Indigenous Peoples are disproportionately affected by HIV and there is considerable disconnect between conventional approaches to HIV prevention/treatment and how Indigenous Peoples access healthcare. Little is known about how urban Indigenous Peoples in Canada conceptualize PrEP, what knowledge gaps exist between Indigenous Peoples and PrEP, how to better communicate the use of PrEP with/by/for Indigenous Peoples, and how to better improve Indigenous Peoples' access and adherence to PrEP. 

The goal of this community-engaged project is to understand perceived facilitators, barriers, and opportunities to accessing, using, and adhering to PrEP for urban Indigenous Peoples in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) through four Talking Circles guided by an Elder and the research team. Two community-based organizations in the GTA, 2-Spirited People of the 1st Nations and Toronto Indigenous Harm Reduction, are partners in this project and have expressed the urgent need to do this research, as it directly impacts the individuals they service. The Talking Circles will be audio recorded and transcribed. Analysis of the transcripts will help to identify themes relating to the project's goal.

This research will help care providers, relevant stakeholders and knowledge users how to better care for urban Indigenous Peoples in the GTA at risk of HIV, and how to improve awareness, access, use, and adherence to PrEP. This project will also inform future research endeavours, including the development of a PrEP service pathway for urban Indigenous Peoples in the GTA, determining whether community pharmacies and pharmacists have a role in reducing barriers, and expanding our understandings of awareness, access, use, and adherence to PrEP among Indigenous Peoples in other jurisdictions and non-urban settings."

Given the emphasis on reducing length of hospital stays and improving access and waiting times, children are increasingly being sent from hospital to home and school environments in the midst of their ongoing recovery. Although a greater responsibility for care is being placed upon children, their families and educators after hospitalization, their readiness to return to normal activities and adherence to self-management regimes may be less than optimal.Effective hospital-to-school transition programs can help mitigate this risk and are a key component of the rehabilitation process linked with improved health outcomes. However, standard practices in this area are currently lacking. Given the substantial variations in the delivery of hospital-to-school transition programs (how and where they are delivered, by whom and for how long) it is critical to understand the best practices in hospital-to-school interventions, particularly the effective components (structure, organization, and specific processes) and what works best for whom. This synthesis will inform the development of best practice guidelines and the further development of effective transition programs. We will use a narrative synthesis approach where studies will also be organized by study design to permit comparisons across different studies on their levels of evidence.Objectives: (1) To critically appraise and synthesize the best practices and effective components (i.e., content, length, format, delivery site, delivery method) of hospital-to-school transition interventions on the physical and psychosocial health for youth with ABI; (2) To develop key recommendations to inform standards of care for pediatric transitions for youth with ABI to enhance youth’s rehabilitation outcomes, and the health-related knowledge of youth and their caregivers; and (3) To highlight gaps in understanding and areas for future research.Using an integrated knowledge translation (KT) approach this systematic review will be driven by an interdisciplinary team with outstanding expertise in ABI, school transitions, systematic reviews and integrated KT. This study is based at Holland Bloorview, the only stand-alone pediatric rehabilitation teaching hospital in Canada with a Centre for Leadership in ABI, expertise in hospital-to-school transitions and a hospital based school. Building on a history of innovative and leading healthcare practices, Holland Bloorview is committed to advancing knowledge generation, synthesis and the identification of best practices to support effective care and clinical practice guidelines.The findings will shed light on best practices in pediatric transitions for youth with ABI and will support clinicians, service organizations, decision-makers and educators to design effective health promotion strategies for this vulnerable population. This review will also identify gaps in understanding and targeted areas for future research. Findings will be disseminated through several workshops, webinars, website toolkits and child friendly forums. Workshops will involve a discussion of key results and the identification of dissemination strategies and specific targets and transfer opportunities (e.g., academic, clinical, lay, school educators, parents and youth)."

Many national organizations have called for Indigenous youth participation as leaders in decision making. However, there has been minimal action towards Indigenous youth leadership initiatives in Canada. The field of health risk communication shows emerging evidence of successful initiatives with Indigenous youth. Indigenous youth involvement in health messaging has contributed to improved message outcomes; enhanced youth's strengths, resiliency, and health; and increased strong protective factors with positive rippling community effects. To improve youth's health, health communications, and community health outcomes, a promising intervention appears to be participatory risk communication. Indigenous youth will create and present health risk messages, while learning co-researcher roles and traditional Indigenous skills. This decolonizing methodology requires further validation through a targeted population intervention across various First Nations, Inuit, and Metis communities. For my thesis research, I will be conducting one of the three case-study interventions with the Yellowknives Dene First Nations (YKDFN) in Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. To build on community strengths and Indigenous knowledge, my research will be community-based and participatory through an Indigenous lens.

Researchers in the field of health risk communication, which is broadly concerned with how people communicate about the risks associated with health issues such as obesity and disease, have recently conducted some successful projects with Indigenous youth. Youth have contributed to better understandings of health problems and solutions, enhanced their strengths and health, and created positive rippling effects in their communities. A promising health intervention appears to be participatory risk communication, an approach that lets First Nations youth take the lead to create and present messages about health. At the same time, they learn Indigenous traditional knowledge skills and how to be co-researchers. This approach aims to improve youth's health, health communications, and community health outcomes, but requires further validation across various First Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities.

Health Perceptions of Dene First Nations Youth in a Community Context,"['Lines, Laurie-Ann']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2240.0,364650,"First Nations' health in Canada, linked to a direct impact of colonization, has been pronounced severe by almost every social determinant of health. Understanding the perspective from First Nations on health meaning and issues is a necessary step to effective program planning across the health field. To accentuate community strengths and Indigenous knowledge, this research used a community-based participatory research methodology, where researchers and community participants collaborated through sharing knowledge and relevant lived experiences to promote social change. The research was conducted with the Yellowknives Dene First Nation across their two communities in the Northwest Territories, Canada. We explored the youth's perceptions of health and their idea of agency in health research, contextualized by community members, during a week-long on-the-land workshop. The primary sources of data collection were: 1) a short survey on health research interests; 2) a longer survey on health issues, priorities, and information; 3) research sharing circles with youth discussing health issues, youth involvement in health research, and their role in addressing community health issues; 4) community mural art and PhotoVoice projects where youth depicted health meaning/priorities; and 5) storytelling interviews with Elders/community members to understand their added cultural perspective of youths' perceptions. Capturing a relevant and appropriate understanding of health meaning and current issues is being used to design more effective health programming in these communities. The results of these assessments provide a sound basis for designing programs for youth participation in health messaging, and increase our overall understanding of Indigenous concepts of health and wellbeing."
"The lived experiences of homeless Métis men who were involved with the child welfare system in Calgary, AB","['Link, Claire M']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2800.0,391541,"This paper explores the narratives of Métis men who were involved in the child welfare system and later found themselves homeless. Indigenous peoples in Canada are over-represented among the homeless but there remains little information on their experiences, especially in the case of Métis individuals. Métis perspectives are missing from the already limited research, specifically within the city of Calgary. Provincially, Alberta has a large Métis population, as 19.5% of the total Canadian Métis population resides here (Statistics Canada 2017). However, Métis peoples are often excluded from Indigenous-focused research, with the majority focusing on First Nations peoples. This paper looks at potential connections between the child welfare system and Métis men's later experiences with homelessness. Métis children have been actively removed from their families and placed in child welfare since the infamous ""Sixties Scoop"". Métis peoples deserve the opportunity to share their experiences, to help inform policies that address child welfare and homelessness, both of which have health implications. Métis men are the focus because the limited research has tended to look at the experiences of women and mothers. First Nations scholar Peter Menzies (2009) suggested that looking at men and women separately ensures that the experiences of each gender cannot be generalized, which is important as Indigenous men and women will undoubtedly have unique experiences based on the different social factors surrounding them. This paper utilizes health and sociological perspectives in order to share Métis men's experiences while highlighting homelessness as a social determinant of health. Stafford and Wood (2017) note that homelessness is not only a driver of poor health, but is itself socially determined, often resulting from accumulated family and other social adversities. A health perspective is needed in order to view homelessness as the social determinant of health that it is."

While preliminary research has identified the effectiveness of tools based on the Risk-Need-Responsivity and Structured Professional Judgement models, many of these risk assessments have been criticized as being biased and insensitive to the cultural and historical factors impacting Indigenous youth. For example, the role of cultural connectedness as a protective factor in the prevention of ill health, violence, and criminalization has not been conceptualized or measured in a risk assessment framework, despite research demonstrating the benefits of cultural connectedness in mental wellness and social outcomes for Indigenous youth. Developing such conceptualization and measurement is a vital foundation to understand the healing and reintegration journeys of Indigenous youth and will add to knowledge in the field by highlighting the risk of making life-changing decisions (bail conditions, supervision, level of security) without considering complex factors such as culture, identity, and colonial harms. As the first step in the development of an Indigenous-lead research agenda on the issue, the Culture is Protection Gathering on Youth Violence Prevention will bring together Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers, knowledge users, and Indigenous youth with lived experience to work together to identify important research questions and emerging program, practice and policy issues related to the role of culture in understanding, managing and preventing Indigenous youth violence and criminalization in Canada. The gathering will build consensus on the meaning and role of cultural connectedness in Indigenous youth violence prevention, capture research priorities, and build partnerships and plans for a multi-year Indigenous-led research agenda to explore the identified priorities, including plans to collaborate on applications for project grants."

This study assessed the prevalence and correlates of stroke symptoms in a stroke- and transient ischemic attack (TIA)-free population. 
Methods: Based on the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (2012-2014), multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed using a backward elimination approach. Stroke symptoms were assessed by the Questionnaire for Verifying Stroke-Free Status. 
Results: The study included 25,832 (16.2% immigrants, 1% refugees, 4.7% nonwhite, 50.9% female, mean age 62.37) participants who reported no stroke or TIA. The prevalence of stroke symptoms was 3.2% for one-sided sudden painless weakness, 4.7% for one-sided sudden numbness, 4.8% for sudden painless loss of vision in one or both eyes, 2.8% for sudden hemifield visual loss, 1.9% for sudden inability to understand speech, and 2.9% for sudden inability of linguistic expression. The prevalence of more than 1 symptoms was 13.3%. The adjusted odds (aOR) of stroke symptoms for non-refugee immigrants were 11% lower than the native-born Canadians (aOR=0.89, 95%CI: 0.80-0.99). Symptoms were more prevalent among those with lower income (aORs 1.29 to 2.22), lower education (aOR=1.23), smoking (aORs=1.10), multi-morbidities (aORs 1.79-4.08), chronic pain (aOR=1.35), high risk in waist-to-hip ratio (aOR=1.13), BMI above 25 (aOR 2.51 to 2.62), higher nutrition risk (aOR=1.29), daily intake of more than 5 fat sources (aOR=1.26), no intakes of calcium sources (aOR=1.14). 
Conclusion and implication for policy: Older adults with disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds, unhealthy behaviours and dietary intakes are at elevated risk of stroke symptoms that may have had clinically undetected. Aggressive stroke prophylaxis could be targeted to these identified high-risk populations to improve health equity for the aging population."

Internationally, the optimal intakes of folic acid and vitamin B12 are still regarded as unsettled issues, with a large variety of recommendations across many countries based on evidence about which there is considerable uncertainty. Recently, there has been a move to base
advice on assessment of evidence for the role played by specific food components in causing or preventing chronic diseases. Our team includes leaders in national assessment programs in Africa, N. America, Asia and Europe. Our goal is to develop an approach that can be used to help the individual assessment programs target key areas for refinement of advice.

Because the investigation of the part nutrients play in causing or preventing disease is frustrated by problems of measuring nutritional intake and status, we propose to bring together different strands of evidence on the health effects of folic acid and vitamin B12. These stands of evidence include relationships between health states and (1) diet, (2) supplement use, (3) blood levels, (4) genes variants that alter blood levels, and (5) combinations of gene variants and intake of folic acid and vitamin B12.

We will combine the available evidence on folic acid and vitamin B12 to understand better the volume, credibility and risk of bias of the associations with diverse health outcomes. In addition, we will develop a map of government policy interventions relating to these vitamins,

As an increasing proportion of the world's population is vaccinated, societies have begun to regain some form of normalcy. However, it is evident that COVID-19 will remain a serious public health concern in the coming years, largely driven by variants of concern (VOC - virus mutants with increased spread and/or severity of disease and/or decreased vaccine effectiveness). In many regions the majority of new cases are due to VOC.

It is critical to continuously monitor vaccine effectiveness against VOC (e.g., breakthrough infection rates, transmission rates). Systematic surveillance of the rapidly evolving scientific evidence base is necessary to inform public health action and research aimed at improving the use of current vaccines and development of vaccines and/or boosters.  
 
Living evidence syntheses use rigorous scientific methods to identify, appraise and summarize evidence, proving their usefulness when the evidence base is rapidly developing and bears significant policy and practice importance. Since April 2021 we have deployed 15 editions of a living review to determine the effects of VOC on vaccine efficacy, regularly communicated to PHAC and HC among others. We will extend this series, also considering additional outcomes such as immunity duration, new emerging VOC and new vaccines. We will search the global peer-reviewed and grey literature daily, update our synopsis weekly, and our full synthesis on at least a monthly basis. We will maintain an up-to-date summary of our findings on our website (including plain language summaries in French and English) and disseminate at least monthly briefings through our networks of decision makers.

Our living evidence summaries will ensure that citizens, healthcare and public health professionals and policy makers continue to have access to timely trustworthy evidence to inform their decisions in response to VOCs."

Although many factors contribute to the epidemiology of IGT and T2D, a principal component is diet.  The rural Indian population has undergone a nutrition transition in the past three decades, characterized by decreased consumption of coarse cereals, as well as increased consumption of white rice, wheat, fats, and refined sugars. Few studies have examined the effects of this nutrition transition on non-communicable diseases amongst marginalized populations in rural India. The proposed research will examine the relationship between diet composition and IGT/T2D in the villages of Anchetty and Peraiyur, Tamil Nadu. A cross-sectional study will be used to determine prevalence of IGT and T2D in each site and to identify leading risk factors. Results will be disseminated with maximum benefit to individuals affected by the diabetes epidemic via participatory workshops, policy recommendations, and NGO programming. We hypothesize that refined grain consumption contributes to increased prevalence rates of IGT and T2D, and that small millets have the potential to lessen this burden if made financially accessible to poor and marginalized populations. The development of a novel prevention/management plan for IGT and T2D will improve the quality of life for thousands of rural Indians."

While recent studies improved the treatment of advanced melanomas, few efforts have addressed the public health implications of the rising burden of this cancer in Canada. Despite the rapid rise in incidence, only limited resources were devoted to target public awareness of melanoma, when compared to the United States or Australia.

In a series of our Canadian studies we documented that the rates of increase for melanoma incidence and mortality are much higher in men than in women. Furthermore, we found that in men, melanoma primarily developed on the head/trunk, while in women melanomas appeared on the arms and legs. Finally, we have identified specific regions in Canada with >2-fold higher incidence of melanoma. 

Our combined research highlights that populations in certain parts of Canada due to a variety of factors are at a higher risk of developing melanoma. Importantly, targeting disease awareness and patient education in men vs. women should be done differently since sun exposure practices and affected body areas differ between genders. Also, it is not known whether existing campaigns in other countries such as Australia might be applicable in Canada. It has not been studied how these campaigns should be implemented in our country considering our cultural and geographic diversity. 

In the proposed research with the focus on young adults (ages 18-30) we will study why certain communities may have higher incidence of this cancer than others; what types of melanoma prevention programs may be culturally sensitive and effective in the First Nations communities. We will use existing data nationally on precipitation, solar radiation, shade availability, tree canopy density, etc. to correlate important environmental risk factors with the geographic distribution of melanoma. We will use focus groups to develop gender and region-specific recommendations to help change sun exposure practices."

PS are already at-risk due to the myriad of stressors related to academic pressure, family expectation, identity development, and role changes. Yet, evidence indicate a further increase of up to 40% in psychological problems in response to the pandemic, thus highlighting the urgent need for mental health and resilience promotion. However, service shortages due to changing guidelines and closures have reduced PS access to programs that may support them in their unique experiences and challenges. The INcreasing Students' Pathways to Information, Resilience, and Empowerment (INSPIRE) Program seeks to address the worsening mental health of PS impacted by the pandemic by building resilience capacity in individuals and communities. 

My post-doctoral research builds on the Multi-System Model of Resilience (MSMR), a theoretical model I developed and validated across several populations. The MSMR recognizes resilience as an evolving capacity stemming from how well resilience resources are mobilized in response to ongoing needs. My program of research will identify the unique experiences threatening PS mental health within the framework of the MSMR, and develop corresponding intervention strategies following evidence-based approaches. The INSPIRE program will use e-learning platform and gamified activities to build resilience capacities. As part of the planned integrated knowledge translation, an advisory committee will be formed to engage stakeholders in program planning, design, and knowledge dissemination through both novel (e.g., social media, digital storytelling) and traditional (e.g., community forums, conferences, papers) channels.

Family-based lifestyle programs delivered at local communities can be effective. However, many families cannot attend these in-person programs due to travel distances and program availabilities. Additionally, these programs are not tailored to the family's culture, motivation level and personal goals. With continued improvements in the sophistication and access to
digital communication technology (e.g. Internet, wearables, smartphones), delivering tailored lifestyle programs using these tools may be well-suited to meet these challenges.

Research has shown that self-esteem can be associated with psychological benefits such as reduced negative emotions and stress. Negative emotions and stress represent risk factors for disturbances in individuals' biological systems and physical health. In fact, if people experience stress, self-esteem has been shown to buffer associated effects on increases in cortisol secretion. It may prevent exposure to negative impacts of a person's immune functioning. This biological dysregulation is likely to increase older adults' vulnerability to developing a variety of age-related diseases. Self-esteem could protect physical health among people who experience stressful life events. Furthermore, research suggests that older adulthood is associated with a linear decline in self-esteem. This possibility will be investigated through analysis of data from a longitudinal study of older adults who have been followed over a period of 8 years (Montreal Aging and Health Study). It is hypothesized that declines in self-esteem will predict biological dysregulation of immune systems and increased physical health problems. The results from this research project are likely to discover mechanisms of successful aging that could be targeted in clinical interventions. It may thus contribute to improving quality of life among the elderly population and reduce associated costs for public health services."
"Added, free and total sugar content and consumption of foods and beverages in Canada","['Liu, Siyuan']",['N/A'],['Nutrition Consumption'],1500.0,418316,"Background
Consumption of sugars contributes to obesity and consequent chronic diseases. The World Health Organization and the US Department of Agriculture recommend consummation of added and free sugars not to exceed 10% of total energy intake (TEI). The added and free sugar content of foods and beverages consumed in Canada is not documente wd, and the sugar consumption and compliance with the above recommendation are unknown.
Data and methods
The added and free sugar content of 5,374 foods and beverages listed in the 24-hour dietary recalls of the 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey-Nutrition was calculated using established procedures. The distribution of usual intake of the added, free and total sugars by Canadians was estimated using the National Cancer Institution method.
Results 
On average, Canadians consume 57.07 g/day added sugars, 66.62 g/day free sugars and 105.83 g/day total sugars in 2015. The average estimated added, free and total sugar intake contributed to 11.4%, 13.3% and 21.65% of TEI, respectively. Only 49.05% and 33.48% of Canadians consumed no more than 10% TEI from added and free sugars, respectively. The high sugars food groups included desserts and sweets, breakfast cereals, baked products, beverages and snacks. Desserts and sweets, and beverages contributed to most sugar intake in the Canadian diet.
Interpretation
Most Canadians consumed added and free sugars in excess of recommendations. Estimated values in this study will help policymakers articulate intervention targets and help researchers to evaluate the health and economic impacts of excessive sugar consumption."

Our past work found that individuals who sustain multiple head injuries may have different risks and outcomes compared to those who sustain fewer injuries, for example, higher odds of engaging in assault and substance use (excluding cannabis; Livingston, Thornton, & Cox, 2017). This work resulted in changes to the subsequent province-wide adolescent health survey to allow for a more thorough investigation of mechanism of injury and medical care. This project aims to identify risk factors for not receiving medical care following TBI in adolescents and to determine the unique characteristics of youth who sustain multiple injuries. Identification and characterization of adolescents who are not receiving care is necessary to develop targeted programs to prevent and manage head injuries and their consequences.

This is an important time to focus on the optimal approaches to measure chronic disease in the population, given increasing rates for many chronic conditions and growing numbers of individuals with multiple conditions. New databases that are emerging as important tools for chronic disease research and surveillance include electronic medical records (EMRs), which contain a wealth of clinical and risk factor information, and long-term care resident assessment data, to describe the complex disease patterns of older adult populations.Aims and Objectives:The aims of my research program are to:1. Evaluate the quality of new electronic health databases for chronic disease research and surveillance,2. Develop new methods to accurately identify disease cases from multiple electronic health databases,3. Improve disease risk factor measurement and risk prediction.The research objectives include comparing the quality of new and established databases for disease surveillance, testing longitudinal and meta-analytic models for disease case ascertainment, and constructing probabilistic measures of disease risk for prediction models.Approach:Electronic health databases housed at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy will initially be used to examine database quality and test the feasibility of new methods for case identification. Over the long term, this research will be extended to other provinces to assess external validity. Empirical and simulation studies will be used to construct and test new statistical methods to accurately identify disease cases and evaluate risk prediction models.Expertise:This research program benefits from my expertise in working with health databases from multiple jurisdictions, risk prediction models, and longitudinal data analysis techniques. Program experts from clinical medicine, population and public health, statistics, and computer science will contribute their knowledge of databases, statistical models, and behavioral risk measures and prediction. Knowledge users from the Public Health Agency of Canada, provincial health ministries, and primary care practices, will benefit from integrated knowledge translation activities.Training:Trainees will participate in national and international events and activities about big data and statistical models for observational data, engage with established research networks to facilitate their interactions with multidisciplinary teams, and participate in data- and methods-related workshops, seminars, and consultations through Manitoba’s SUPPORT (Support for People- and Patient-Oriented Research and Trials) Unit.Impact:In the short term, my research will generate new knowledge about (a) the unique contributions of EMR and resident assessment databases to inform chronic disease research and surveillance, (b) accurate methods to distinguish disease cases from non-cases in electronic health databases, and (c) probability-based models to derive risk factors from administrative health databases.

A family or personal history of chronic diseases, like high blood pressure and high blood sugar, might help to accurately predict who is at risk of having a fracture due to weak bones, but there has been little research on this topic. In addition, there are only a few places in the world that can collect reliable family health history for a large number of people without relying on self-report information, which is not always very accurate. In this study, we plan to look at the role of reliable family and personal history information about chronic diseases to predict fracture risk. We will do this using  world-famous administrative health data from Manitoba. Administrative data including records of hospital stays, visits to doctors and medication use. These records contain diagnoses that can be used to find out who has chronic diseases and fractures. As well, Manitoba's administrative data can be linked together for families. This allows us to build reliable family histories of diseases for the parents and siblings of a person. Our study is novel, because we will be among the first to use reliable family history, and use family and personal histories of chronic diseases, to improve fracture risk prediction. As well, our study can provide a useful foundation for future studies about predicting other diseases using family and personal histories.

The IPDLN connects data linkage centres in more than 30 countries; the conference hosts events to stimulate discussions in emerging areas of population health improvement. Our workshop will bring together speakers from data linkage centres in six countries to share their research, and discuss the challenges that they face. The workshop will also explore approaches and methods to effectively address sex-specific research questions and encourage advanced analytic techniques to extract new knowledge from linked health history data. The workshop will identify research priorities to guide future intergenerational studies of chronic diseases in multiple countries."
Comparing Methods to Construct Chronic Disease Histories from Administrative Data: Application to Family Disease Studies,"['Lix, Lisa M']","['Azimaee, Mahmoud', 'Chiu, Yohann M', 'Ejlskov, Linda', 'Hamad, Amani', 'Jafari Jozani, Mohammad', 'Plana-Ripoll, Oleguer', 'Selvitella, Alessandro M', 'Sorensen, Henrik T']","['Clustering', 'Diagnoses', 'Family History', 'International Classification Of Diseases', 'Longitudinal', 'Unsupervised Learning']",508725.0,469922,"A family history of a common chronic disease, such as heart disease, can help to identify people with a higher-than-usual risk of developing a chronic disease in the future. Collecting information about chronic disease histories for individuals and their family members can be difficult because self-reported information is often not accurate for events from the past. Diagnosis codes in hospital records and physician billing records can be used to build personal and family disease histories for entire populations and are not affected by recall bias. However changes in disease coding systems over time and differences in healthcare systems around the world can affect the accuracy of disease history measures, particularly for complex diseases. Our study will compare two methods to create disease histories using healthcare data from Manitoba and Denmark and assess their value for predicting disease risk. One method uses a set of rules to assign diagnosis codes to a small number of clinician-defined categories and then translates these categories over time. The second method uses machine-learning methods to search for related diagnosis codes collected over time and then combines the codes into groups based on the strength of these relationships. Healthcare data from Denmark will be used to assess whether these methods will produce comparable results in a different healthcare setting. In both Manitoba and Denmark, we will build models to predict the risk of common chronic diseases, including heart disease and mental disorders, and describe the predictive value of personal and family disease histories from machine-learning and rule-based clinical classification methods. Software tools and code will be developed to share our methods. Our research will improve studies about population disease burden and outcomes for at-risk populations and will benefit scientists from Canadian and international healthcare data centres."
Self-efficacy and physical activity in children,"['Li, Yao-Chuen']",['N/A'],"['Child Health', 'Ics Travel Awards', 'Physical Activity', 'Sedentary Behaviour', 'Self-Efficacy']",1000.0,324454,"Higher self-efficacy is strongly associated with greater levels of physical activity in children and adolescents. However, our understanding of the long-term relationship between self-efficacy and physical activity is very limited. Therefore,the purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of self-efficacy on sedentary behaviours and physical activity patterns in school-aged children over time. 2278 10-year-old children were followed up from 2005 to 2008. All children completed two questionnaires measuring self-efficacy (confidence in, preference for, and enjoyment) and physical activity patterns (sedentary behaviours, free play, and organized activity), respectively. The results found that children's free play increased and organized activity decreased over time. In addition, although children with high adequacy had higher free play and organized activity relative to other children, this effect diminished over time. Children with high predilection also had higher free play and organized activity, but the gaps between groups widened over time. Lastly, while sedentary behaviours were lower over time in children with high prediction, it was consistently higher in children with high enjoyment. The differences in sedentary behaviours between groups increased over time for both predilection and enjoyment. Overall, this study found that higher self-efficacy is related to greater participation in physical activity, and that the impact of predilection increases over time, which either facilitates the participation in free play, or buffers the decrease in organized play and the increase in sedentary behaviours. Thus, in order to improve children's physical health, interventions targeting on the enhancement of predilection may facilitate physical activity and reduce sedentary behaviours."

We will focus on AI tools that could help professionals to serve marginalized communities through social media, and AI apps on smart devices could be used to provide services, but we will consider other types of tools as well. The outcome of this work will be an agenda for research and development projects that will use artificial intelligence to help public health professionals to better serve marginalized populations."

Most people with intellectual disabilities today live in community settings and access the general health care system; therefore health professionals need accurate information on health concerns both current and future for both  treatment and prevention for this population.This project will build active and meaningful collaborations amongst researchers, public health officials, community stakeholders, medical professionals, and knowledge users to promote the health of individuals with intellectual disabilities.The outcome of the meeting will be a draft of a strategic analysis and dissemination plan of available health information in the Special Olympics International Healthy Athletes Database to address existing gaps in the literature and inform a large scale secondary data analysis grant."
Neurosciences and the Afterlife of Death: Re-imagining Notions of Suicidal Risk,"['Lloyd, Stephanie']","['Choudhury, Suparna', 'Jollant, Fabrice', 'Kirmayer, Laurence J', 'Raikhel, Eugene A', 'Turecki, Gustavo X']","['Kin', 'Medical Anthropology', 'Mental Health', 'Narrative Analysis', 'Neurosciences', 'Psychiatry', 'Qualitative Research', 'Risk', 'Science Studies', 'Suicide']",159046.0,253373,"Suicide has often been associated with particular subpopulations such as those people who are socially marginalized or, alternatively, who suffer from mental illness. Together, these explanations have created a perception of suicide as linked to both individual negative experiences as well as collective factors - often these levels of explanation are seen to interact, for instance, when collective stressful circumstances lead to individual emotional problems. New research emerging from the neurosciences is suggesting new ways in which these factors might interact while at the same time trying to identify who might ultimately attempt suicide either in response to adverse life experiences or psychiatric disorders. The neuroscience explanations suggest that adverse early childhood experiences and inherited traits might lead to higher suicide rates among a neurologically-specific portion of the population. In order to test this hypothesis, scientists are enrolling the family members of people who have committed suicide, referred to as ""suicide completers"", in studies to either assist in after-death psychological assessments of suicide completers or to participate in fMRI studies to determine whether living family members exhibits suicide risk factors presumed to be shared with their dead kin. This study will explore the ways in which participation in neuroscience research is changing perceptions of the dead (e.g. their reasons for committing suicide), perceptions of the suicidal risk among their living kin, the relatedness (interpersonal and biological) of kin to suicide completers and suicide risk in general. Further, we are interested in the ways in which new scientific explanations of suicide are being integrated into people's previous beliefs about suicidal behaviour and interacting with the means by which people make sense of suicide."
Preventable strokes and deaths in atrial fibrillation patients: Understanding the impacts of anticoagulant nonadherence and nonpersistence,"['Loewen, Peter S']","['Andrade, Jason G', 'Chen, WENJIA', 'De Vera, Mary A', 'Deyell, Marc W', 'Rush, Kathy L', 'Sadatsafavi, Mohsen', 'salmasi, shahrzad', 'Zhao, Yinshan']","['Adherence', 'Anticoagulation', 'Atrial Fibrillation', 'Death', 'Economic', 'Persistence', 'Stroke']",260101.0,410174,"Atrial fibrillation (Afib) is a type of irregular heart rhythm that is common in Canada. Patients with Afib are at much higher risk of stroke than those without Afib. Stroke can lead to disability or death, so it is crucial to prevent it in those at risk. A group of medications called ""anticoagulants"" are very effective for preventing stroke in AFib patients, but they can't work if they are not taken reliably by patients. Our goal is to provide an understanding of how big this problem is so we can help protect Canadians against preventable strokes and deaths.

To achieve this goal, we will study health data (e.g. prescriptions, physician billing records, hospital records) of all Afib patients in British Columbia since 1996. We will study their patterns of medication taking to identify how many of the AF patients are early quitters, late quitters, perfect users, and those who miss many of their doses. We will also identify which kinds of patients follow each pattern so we can better know how to provide the right patients with the right kinds of help to improve their medication taking. We will then study how many strokes and deaths are caused by problems with medication-taking (stopping, taking it unreliably) and the resulting costs to the healthcare system.

Our research team includes clinicians, researchers and policy makers who have extensive experience working with AF patients and doing this type of research. Our research will provide much-needed evidence to clinicians, patients, and policymakers to better protect patients with AF against avoidable strokes and deaths."

Patients with Afib are at much higher risk of stroke than those without Afib. Stroke can lead to disability or death, so it is crucial to prevent it in those at risk. A group of medications called oral anticoagulants (OACs) are very effective for preventing stroke in Afib patients, but they can't work if they are not taken reliably, a concept called ""adherence"". Our goal is to gain a better understanding of the complexities of adherence to find effective ways to help patients be more adherent to OACs, and thereby prevent the serious consequences of Afib, including stroke, death, and hospitalization. Two extremely promising areas for making such discoveries are: finding the cut-off points (""thresholds"") below which nonadherence leads to serious outcomes, and 2) measuring the clinical consequences of various long-term patterns (""trajectories"") of adherence that patients exhibit.  
 
To do this, we will study health data (e.g., prescriptions, physician billing records, hospital records) of all Afib patients in British Columbia since 2010 when newer OACs became available. We will study their OAC adherence to see what thresholds are most important for predicting serious outcomes. We will also study how different trajectories of adherence affect the rate of serious outcomes. Our research team includes clinicians and researchers with extensive experience working with patients with AF and doing this type of research with large population-level databases.  
 
The results of this research will help care providers, researchers, and policymakers better identify which patients are at highest risk and could benefit the most from improving their OAC adherence, design more effective programs to help patients be more adherent to their OACs, implement policies that provide the greatest benefit for patients, and do better research about all these issues in the future."
Visual and performance arts for HIV prevention with Indigenous youth in the Northwest Territories and Nunavut: A mixed-methods multiple case study,"['Logie, Carmen', 'Lys, Candice L']","['Amirault, Marni D', 'MacNeill, Nancy', 'Gesink, Dionne', 'Healey Akearok, Gwen K', 'Loppie, Charlotte J', 'Newman, Peter A']","['Arts-Based Interventions', 'Case Study', 'Empowerment', 'Evaluation', 'Hiv And Aids', 'Indigenous Youth', 'Mixed Methods', 'Northwest Territories', 'Nunavut']",449098.0,324622,"There are staggering sexual health disparities in Canada's North in comparison with the rest of Canada.

Having a STI is a known risk factor for HIV transmission. HIV and STI vulnerability among Indigenous youth is situated in inequitable structural and social contexts. There is limited rigorous evaluation of HIV prevention strategies tailored for Indigenous youth, in particular assessing long-term impacts. 

This 3-year study aims to generate knowledge of how existing arts-based HIV prevention strategies in the NWT (FOXY) and Nunavut (Sexual Health Drama Project [SHDP]) reduce HIV vulnerability, and increase protective factors, among Indigenous youth. We also aim to build capacity in HIV prevention and research among Northern Indigenous youth and promote North-North partnership building. We will conduct 2 interrelated project components: a) arts-based intervention and evaluation and b) knowledge translation and exchange. Phase 1: we will implement FOXY in the NWT and SHDP in Nunavut with Indigenous youth aged 13-15 (n=160). FOXY and SHDP involve visual (body-mapping) and performance (forum theatre) arts techniques, Indigenous knowledge, involvement of Elders, and training of youth peer leaders. We will conduct pre/post-test and 6-month follow-up surveys to assess changes in HIV and STI knowledge, cultural connectedness, self-esteem, empowerment and safer sex self efficacy. We will also conduct longitudinal interviews with participants and peer leaders to understand processes of change associated with participating in the intervention.

The suicide rate in the Northwest Territories (NWT) is 65% higher than the Canadian average. In the NWT sexually transmitted infection (STI) rates were ten times higher than the national rate. Scant research has attended to health determinants among Northern lesbian, bisexual, transgender, queer and other sexually and gender diverse (LGBTQ+) populations.  Our team is prepared to launch the first community-based research (CBR) collaboration on mental and sexual health dynamics among a neglected population in Canada's North: LGBTQ+ youth in the NWT. Stigma and discrimination targeting LGBTQ+ youth are pervasive global phenomena that have devastating impacts on health and wellbeing. Yet there is little understanding of how stigma is experienced among diverse LGBTQ+ in Northern Canada, including its intersections with gender, ethnicity, and rural/urban residence. This Planning Grant aims to establish an interdisciplinary team comprised of LGBTQ+ youth, adult and allied researchers, practitioners and community advocates to develop a locally informed initiative in the NWT. The goal is to develop a Northern program of research focused on social and structural contexts of health among LGBTQ+ youth that will integrate diverse theoretical, methodological and stakeholder perspectives. Our objectives are to: (1) conduct a critical synthesis of the literature on social and structural contexts of health among LGBTQ+ youth, integrating Aboriginal and Northern perspectives, contexts and experiences; (2) hold a 2-day meeting in Yellowknife, NWT with interdisciplinary researchers, LGBTQ+ youth, community groups and service providers to explore and identify LGBTQ+ youth health research priorities, questions and appropriate methodologies to develop a CBR team and research program; and (3) to develop and submit a 2015 CIHR Operating Grant focused on LGBTQ+ youth health priorities."

For example, SGMY are more likely to be homeless, enhancing vulnerability to sexual and physical violence, sex work and drug use. These factors elevate risk for HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI). Yet little is known about the linkages between stigma, discrimination and HIV/STI risk among SGMY in the Caribbean region, with the highest HIV prevalence in the world after Sub-Saharan Africa. Young (under 25 years old) men who have sex with men (MSM) in Jamaica have HIV infection rates of 28% - the highest in the region. Stigma and discrimination reduce access to HIV prevention. SGMY in Jamaica reported hate crimes, sexual and physical violence and homelessness. Intersectionality theory highlights the challenges (e.g. stigma) and opportunities (e.g. resilience, social capital) that emerge from having stigmatized identities. Resilience and social capital have been understudied among SGMY. 

This 3-year study aims to understand HIV/STI risk and protective factors among SGMY in Kingston, Jamaica. Phase 1 (qualitative): 60 cognitive interviews with young SGMY, including MSM (n=20), women who have sex with women (WSW) (n=20), transgender people (n=20) and key informants (n=12) to explore conceptualizations of HIV/STI risk and protective factors. Phase 2 (quantitative): survey among MSM (n=150), WSW (n=150) and transgender people (n=150) to assess associations between structural factors (e.g. stigma), protective factors (e.g. resilience) and HIV/STI risk. Phase 3: participatory action research using arts-based approaches (e.g. theatre) to share research findings with SGMY and diverse community stakeholders in roundtables, forums, and street theatre.
Project goals are to understand associations between structural factors,  protective factors and HIV/STI risks among SGMY to inform HIV/STI prevention."

Phase 1 involves consultations with Elders and Indigenous leaders in 6 communities (Yellowknife, Hay River, K'atlodeeche First Nation, Inuvik, Fort Smith, Bechkoko). Phase 2 involves retreats with Indigenous young men (n=20) and women (n=20) aged 13 to 15 from the 6 locations. We will implement Intergenerational Dialogue Exchange and Action to foster cultural knowledge transmission between Elders and youth; this will involve focus groups and digital storytelling. Phase 3 will involve surveys with Indigenous youth (n=200) in the 6 study sites at 2 time-points (baseline, 12 month follow-up). We will examine associations between the syndemic and HIV/STI vulnerability, and test cultural connectedness and resilience as mediators. We will conduct longitudinal qualitative interviews (n=36) to understand trajectories of HIV/STI risks and resiliencies. Phase 4 involves knowledge mobilization with community stakeholders, including community forums, digital story screenings, roundtables and a Project Toolkit."

Forty percent of the world's refugee and displaced people are under the age of 18. Uganda hosts more than 1.4 million refugees, the 3rd largest refugee hosting nation in the world and the largest in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our CIHR funded research in Kampala, Uganda found that 74% of urban refugee adolescent girls and young women, and 49% of adolescent boys and young men, reported depression symptoms. Psychological stressors among refugee youth include trauma, violence and stigma. Food, water and sanitation insecurity are linked with anxiety and depression in diverse contexts, but little is known of their association with youth mental health. There are limited scalable, youth-tailored approaches to reduce depression among refugee youth. OUR IDEA: This innovative study involves working with urban refugee and displaced youth aged 16-24 in Kampala, Uganda to adapt Group Problem Management Plus (Group PM+), a WHO scalable intervention, for refugee youth. We will also develop 'Participatory Ecosocial Approaches to Community Empowerment' (PEACE), a participatory mapping intervention to identify and address environmental stressors. We will compare the effectiveness of a) Group PM+ alone, b) PEACE alone, and c) Group PM+ and PEACE together, compared with the standard of care, in reducing psychological distress among urban refugee adolescents and youth. OUR APPROACH: Phase 1) Qualitative research to identify linkages between social, environmental, and resource scarcity stressors, and adaptation of Group PM+; 2) implementing a 2x2 factorial trial with refugee youth aged 16-24 in 4 informal settlements in Kampala; 3) participatory knowledge mobilization.

Our past CIHR-funded research demonstrated the potential of Fostering Open eXpression among Youth (FOXY) and Strengths, Masculinities & Sexual Health (SMASH). FOXY and SMASH are arts-based, culturally grounded, strengths-focused and Indigenous-led sexual health programs to improve sexual health among Northern and Indigenous youth. We also found age, gender and sexual orientation differences in FOXY and SMASH outcomes, pointing to the need for mixed-methods research to further explore and address health needs and priorities of diverse youth in the NWT. OUR IDEA: We will first conduct qualitative research to understand how and why FOXY and SMASH work for improving sexual and reproductive health (SRH), for whom, and in what circumstance. We will then adapt FOXY and SMASH, and conduct a longitudinal cohort study with Northern and Indigenous youth in the NWT to explore trajectories of health and resilience.

High incidence communities tend to be clustered together and
are bound both by their geographic proximity and through kinship to members of other nearby communities. We believe that eliminating TB in these regional clusters is additionally complicated given that TB programming and the provision of services is defined by jurisdictional and geographical borders that do not reflect the mobility and realities of the people who live there. In other words, these jurisdictional borders and the resultant delineation of services tend not to be based on the realities of the people to whom TB programming is meant to relate. As such, in Component I we proposed the development of a cross-border,
regional coalition to advocate for better population and community health supports that would have the downstream effect of reducing TB transmission and progression to disease. TB elimination cannot be met in isolation, but
instead requires that interests of the region at large and the people living therein be considered and promoted. In Component II, this regional committee would support the implementation of two locally specific TB elimination strategies across diverse, yet interconnected, communities. Our team has identified two interrelated strategies that we will implement and evaluate in component II. These two TB elimination strategies are: 1) improved, regional, surveillance and translation of those surveillance data back to relevant community members, and 2) an expanded program of outreach that has as its primary focus ""wellness""."

Relatively few studies have addressed this form of ""unpaid work"" in men living with chronic, inflammatory types of arthritis, like rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis. The superior's previous work on mothers with arthritis has demonstrated a number of significant impacts on performing the tasks of parenthood, yet it is unknown if the health and illness factors associated with parenting task limitations are similar in fathers. In particular, the student project will explore the intersection of mobility limitations, physical activity, and performance of parenting tasks by fathers, as well as the psychosocial impact of arthritis on their identity as fathers. 

The summer project will adapt the mothers survey for use with fathers in a computer-administered format, (a format increasingly requested by study participants with handwriting limitations). Under the direction of the faculty supervisor, the student will recruit 20-40 pilot test participants with the assistance of arthritis consumer organizations, administer the arthritis and parenting survey, enter data into a statistical package, analyze and interpret the data, and report findings to both scientific and lay audiences. She will assist with the development of an operating grant application, incorporating the pilot test findings, so that a larger study may be conducted to answer the main research question: what is the impact of inflammatory arthritis on participation in the day-to-day tasks of fatherhood? Study results will lead to potential strategies for enhancing performance and reducing disability. Helping men with arthritis to fulfill a valued life role as a father is important in maintaining their health, psychological well-being and quality of life."
Maternal education and offspring mental health in adulthood : Identifying the mediating pathways,"['Loose, Tianna T']",['N/A'],"['Inter-Generational Transmission', 'Logitudinal', 'Maternal Education', 'Mediation', 'Mental Health', 'Parenting Practices', 'Prevention', 'School Attendance', 'Socio-Economic Status', 'Substance Misuse']",135000.0,455651,"Children living in disadvantaged socioeconomic contexts are at greater risk of developing mental health problems in adulthood. This project examines the role of maternal education -a key determinant of the life conditions in which children evolve- in the pathway leading to mental health problems. While research has shown that low maternal education is associated with offspring mental health, little is known about why such an association exists.  Identifying the explanatory mechanisms of this association is crucial to develop effective strategies to dampen the negative intergenerational effects of low maternal education on the offspring. Building on the strengths of 4 large longitudinal cohorts covering birth to adulthood, we will investigate two hypothesized mechanisms putatively linking low maternal education with offspring mental health. The first stipulates that mothers' education level influences the parent-child relationship (e.g. attachment, coercive parenting practices) and in turn offspring mental health. The second posits that mothers with lower education have access to lower quality educational environments (e.g. day-care services/school) for their children, which would increase risk for mental health problems. Data comes from 1) a large sample (N=300,000) linking datasets from multiple administrative sources from birth to adulthood and 2) three prospective cohorts (N=3018; N=2120; N=1037) with information on maternal education, maternal and offspring mental health problems (questionnaires/interviews) and a wide range of familial (e.g. parenting practices) and educational (e.g. daycare, school socioeconomic factors) assessed from childhood to adulthood.  My project will highlight the importance of education among women, pinpoint effective strategies to attenuate negative influences of low maternal education and support children with low-SES."

Ainsi, il est pertinent d'aborder le vieillissement sous l'angle du travail, à la recherche des contraintes et conditions ayant un impact sur la santé mentale des travailleurs (Damasse, Doyon, 2000). De Gaulejac (1991) souligne que les changements organisationnels qui impliquent l'innovation ne s'avèrent pas sans risque pour la santé des travailleurs. De plus, l'organisation du travail et la transformation des pratiques utilisées pour réaliser les tâches sont de plus en plus pointées comme contraignantes pour la santé mentale (Dejours, 2013).

Towards a theoretical framework of the implementation of peer-led health promotion programs targeting seniors,"['Lorthios-Guilledroit, Agathe']",['N/A'],"['Health Promotion', 'Implementation Science', 'Literature Review', 'Peer Education', 'Seniors']",2500.0,337307,"Conceptual frameworks in public health suggest that program implementation is influenced by determinants related to participants, providers, organizational and environmental contexts, as well as program characteristics. However, their relative importance and their mechanisms of action in specific contexts are still not well understood. More theoretical work is thus needed in order to optimize the implementation of health promotion programs. Peer-led health promotion programs targeting seniors may particularly benefit from such endeavours given their emerging popularity. This presentation aims to report the findings of a literature review on the determinants of implementation of peer-led health promotion programs targeting seniors as a first step for developing a theoretical framework for implementation of such programs. Five databases were searched using the following keywords and related terms: health promotion programs, implementation, peers, and seniors. A manual search was also performed from the reference lists of relevant papers. Papers written in English or French were included. Few studies have examined the implementation of peer-led health promotion programs targeting seniors. Most of them have used participation rate as an indicator of implementation success. Factors influencing implementation were mostly related to the organizational context in which programs were implemented. While factors identified in this literature review were in line with the general literature on program implementation, they were more often inferred from authors' opinions rather than from study results. Findings from this literature review provide insights for developing a theoretical framework explaining the implementation of peer-led health promotion programs targeting seniors. The next step of our research consist of developing and testing this framework using empirical data from a multi-site study of the effectiveness of a peer-led falls prevention program."

This program will break new ground by expanding upon a program science approach-an emerging paradigm in global public health that embeds research processes throughout the life cycle of HIV interventions to ensure a more effective response, at every stage, as informed by sound scientific evidence. More specifically, the CBIR team has the following aims: 1) to build a community-centered and accessible global evidence base that describes and analyses the individual, environmental and structural barriers that inhibit MSM from accessing and/or navigating between HIV prevention, care and treatment in Winnipeg, Chengdu and Nairobi; 2) to assemble, refine and strengthen local responses to HIV/STI epidemics among vulnerable communities of MSM in these three cities, drawing upon the evidence and analysis built in objective 1; and 3) to fostering more egalitarian relationships between scientists, clinicians and knowledge users, by incorporating community-based principles throughout the program-so as to democratize the flow, interpretation, and ownership of the specialized knowledge produced through this intervention research program.

Furthermore, by the mid-1980s, AIDS in Central, Eastern and Southern Africa was characterized as a heterosexual epidemic with homosexual transmission considered as being absent or occurring at a very low level.  Today, HIV prevention and intervention efforts in many parts of Africa continue to primarily center on heterosexual transmission dynamics and grossly fail to encompass the needs of men who have sex with men (MSM). The silence around the homosexual transmission of HIV has been abetted by ongoing human rights violations, homophobic government pronouncements and policies, stigma and violence. Reports of high HIV prevalence and incidence among MSM in Africa have gone virtually unaddressed, until recent calls to action. Previous research conducted by our team shows that a subset of MSM in Nairobi, those who practise sex work, are highly vulnerable to HIV infection. Between 2009 and 2012, 510 male sex workers (MSWs) attended a Nairobi-based clinic. The baseline HIV prevalence was 40.4% and the annual HIV incidence among uninfected participants was 11.8%. Reliable evidence that can explain why this group is highly vulnerable to HIV infection is urgently needed to develop an effective intervention. The proposed study has the following overarching aims: (1) to produce a reliable base of evidence that can explain the individual, social and political factors that shape the HIV-vulnerability of male sex workers in Nairobi and (2) to set up a community-based intervention that can address these various levels of vulnerability.

"Precipitation, demographics and built environment features are associated with sedentary behaviour in 9-14-year-old children-the longitudinal study on Seasonality and Saskatoon Kids (SASK)","['Lotoski, Larisa C']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,382848,"Objectives: This longitudinal study seeks to establish: a) How changes in weather conditions affect total daily SED in children, and b) How SED effects are moderated by urban design.
Methods: Families with children aged 9-14 years were recruited from the prairie city of Saskatoon, Canada (n=816). Location-specific SED was measured in children over three time frames (Sept-Dec 2014; Jan-April 2015; May-Sept 2015) using GPS equipped accelerometers. Neighbourhood level built environment (BE) features were assessed using multiple audit tools. A multilevel modeling approach was taken to understand the relationship between weather conditions, demographics, BE and total daily SED of children.
Results: On average, children with valid accelerometry data accumulated 4.5 hours of sedentary time per day. In a multilevel model higher total daily precipitation was significantly associated with increased levels of SED, but differentially moderated by BE universal accessibility. Increased levels of both light and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (PA) were negatively associated with increased accumulation of SED. With increased age, the level of SED increased at a greater rate in females, in comparison to males. Pedestrian access was positively associated with reduced sedentariness in females, but increased sedentariness in males.
Conclusions: Disruptive positive interventions to minimize SED in both boys and girls, especially as they age, may provide the greatest benefit when done so in our youngest populations.The simultaneous examination of both weather conditions and the built environment in a 1 year longitudinal setting is unique to our study. Focus on SED, and taking into account light and moderate-to-vigorous PA are also not commonly done in previous research. This project will shape infill and new urban development projects by providing necessary information to relevant public health policy architects."
Who is walking and biking to work or school in Saskatoon? An analysis of transportation methods used by Saskatonians,"['Lotoski, Larisa C']",['N/A'],"['Active Transportation', 'Built Environment', 'City Planning', 'Population Health', 'Utility Transportation']",1500.0,344639,"Objective: To understand the travel behaviours of adult Saskatoon residents based on their primary form of transportation to and from work or school.
Methods: A random sample of adult Saskatoon residents were surveyed by telephone (n=600) as part of developing an Active Transportation Plan for Saskatoon. The questionnaire administered included 43 items exploring current travel behaviours in both summer and winter months, attitudes and barriers towards specific forms of transportation and demographic information. Users and non-users of active (cycling, walking) and inactive (driving) forms of utility transport and the perceived barriers to walking and cycling more frequently were compared using Chi-square and logistic regression analysis.
Results: Of those surveyed 4% (n=22) walked, 8% (n=47) cycled, and 45% (n=271) utilized a vehicle as their primary transportation mode between home and work or school. Those who walked or cycled were significantly less likely to be senior citizens or live in the suburban areas of the city, but were more likely to report safety and weather as a barrier to biking more frequently. Those who drove or carpooled were significantly less likely to be senior citizens, but were more likely to live in neighbourhoods with highest street connectivity and have an annual household income of >$40,000.
Conclusions: Area of residency and income are significant predictors of active and vehicle transport methods between work or school and home. Specifically, this research is part of current effort to develop a comprehensive Active Transportation Plan for the City of Saskatoon. Generally, understanding the determinants of participating in active forms of transport can inform both researchers and policy makers, helping develop healthier cities within the prairies and contribute to reducing non-communicable diseases including obesity"

Négliger de se pencher sur ces enjeux pourrait également nuire à la qualité des soins offerts aux patient­e­s. Ainsi, le but de cette étude est de mieux comprendre les différentes formes d'injustices vécues par les EPN dans leur milieu de travail, et leur impact sur leur bien-être et leurs pratiques professionnelles. Pour ce faire, des groupes de discussion seront réalisés avec des EPN, qui échangeront sur leurs expériences d'injustices en s'appuyant sur des images de leur choix. Un sondage en ligne sera ensuite diffusé pour estimer dans quelle mesure les injustices identifiées sont vécues par les EPN à travers le Québec. Des entrevues seront aussi réalisées avec des collègues et gestionnaires non noir-e-s des EPN, pour examiner leur point de vue sur ces enjeux. Puis, l'ensemble des résultats sera utilisé pour codévelopper des outils de sensibilisation visant l'ouverture à la compréhension et à la lutte contre ces injustices.

Due to ongoing colonial attitudes at all levels of government, it is important to find ways to highlight the issues surrounding access to traditional foods, impacts on health, and decision making for Indigenous people on reserves and off. Therefore, I will gather Indigenous ways of knowing and being from knowledge keepers (I.e., elders) through what I refer to as Kitchen Stories. Placing knowledge keepers (around 18-20 in two sites) in a familiar environment will allow for the elders to relax; talking becomes more natural when they are busy cooking or harvesting foods. They can share their memories and stories of accurate traditional attitudes about harvesting, cooking, and preparing foods, as well as knowledge about how our multilevel relationship with food crosses important cultural and social knowing. This sharing can spark memories of others within the group and then, more wisdom flows. Using digital media (such as Zoom), other non-resident Indigenous community members will interact with the knowledge keepers, giving them a chance to get involved in the learning. Next, the knowledge keepers will be invited to make individual video stories to make this information relevant to the next generation. Through these Zoom sessions and video-stories, knowledge keepers will share their insights. The serious business of revitalizing Indigenous food sovereignty will become evident as we engage. It will shed light on the problems Indigenous communities are facing with access to traditional foods and preserving a way of life that is still relevant for next seven generations.  Indigenous and non- Indigenous people will gain deeper understanding of food sovereignty which can compel them to work together for expanded solutions."
"Newborn intestinal microbiome and risk of infections in the first 60 days of life: a nested study in an observational birth cohort in Dhaka, Bangladesh","['Loutet, Miranda G']",['N/A'],"['Child Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Global Health', 'Infectious Disease', 'Microbiome']",105000.0,440107,"The gut microbiome, which is the collection of bacteria present in the gut, begins to develop in the first days of life. An alteration in the development and composition of a newborn's microbiome can lead to severe bacterial infections early in life, such as sepsis, meningitis and pneumonia. There has been growing interest in studying the development of infants' microbiome and its potential protective properties to prevent severe infections among newborns.

My proposed PhD research will be embedded within a larger funded study called Synbiotics for the Early Prevention of Severe Infections in Infants (SEPSIS), which aims to test interventions (probiotics, prebiotics and synbiotics) for the prevention of severe infections during early infancy in Bangladesh. My proposed doctoral research aims to explore whether the bacteria that are naturally found in the gut of newborns has an impact on their risk of developing a severe infection such as sepsis, pneumonia or meningitis. I will explore whether maternal and infant factors, such as mode of delivery and breastfeeding practices, affect the presence of these naturally occurring bacteria and the resulting risk of severe infection; in addition to whether the amount of bacteria influences the severity of infections. 

The burden of severe infections and neonatal mortality is high in South Asia; however, most of the promising research on interventions that affect infants' gut bacteria is conducted in high-income countries and among preterm newborns only. My research is important because it will contribute to the development of innovative prevention and treatment tools in settings where simple and inexpensive interventions can have the largest impact on a child's chance for a healthy life and ultimately towards global health equity."
Understanding support networks of marginalized young women to prevent HIV in Botswana,"['Loutfi, David']",['N/A'],['Ict Travel Awards'],2500.0,368328,"Poverty, poor education, and gender-based violence mean that many young women in Botswana are not able to act on HIV prevention choices to use condoms or limit their number of sexual partners. An HIV prevention trial seeks to help marginalized young women to access government structural programs, improving their ability to choose, and reducing their reliance on transactional sex and hence HIV risk. Identifying and engaging the most marginalized young women is challenging but necessary to ensure that none are left behind.

We carried out a survey about the social networks (real connections between individuals, not social media) of 312 marginalized young women (aged 16-29, not in school and not in work) in two urban and two rural areas of a district of Botswana. We analyzed their social networks to understand who they go to for information (about potential work or school), emotional support, and socializing, exploring how these networks could be used to reach young women more effectively.

We found that outreach is likely to be most effective through other women, and relatives in particular, and outreach through networks might be more effective in rural areas rather than urban areas. Sub-groups, such as the poorest or least educated, may require targeted outreach. Understanding who these young women are connected to can help researchers and services providers reach a group that might otherwise be ignored."
Stakeholder recommendations to increase access of marginalized young women to government support programs in Botswana: evidence-based group discussions,"['Loutfi, David']",['N/A'],"['Evidence-Based Discussions', 'Hiv Prevention', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Ics Travel Award', 'Marginalized Populations', 'Social Network Analysis', 'Young Women']",2500.0,400381,"Young women in southern Africa are at high risk of contracting HIV due to structural factors like poverty, poor education and gender-based violence. The INSTRUCT intervention aims to provide young women with better access to government support programs to reduce their reliance on transactional sex and prevent the spread of HIV. Recruiting young women to participate in this intervention proved challenging, and so we explored novel methods to engage this population.
In discussions with young women, community leaders, and government service providers, we presented findings from our previous survey on the support networks of young women, and discussed strategies for how to reach young women with information about support programs.
Short-term suggestions for sharing information about available programs included forming local committees of young women, using existing village committees, and using social media. Longer-term suggestions included creating a database of phone numbers for mass SMS notifications, and changing the requirements for program applications. Although community leaders felt program information should be shared via social media, young women were not interested in this strategy since they had limited access to phones, internet, and, at times, electricity. Trust was an important factor in determining who young women sought information from and it was often associated with people that had similar lived experiences. They preferred going to friends and family, rather than going to government service providers to learn about available support programs.
These findings provide an opportunity to better include young women in support programs and prevent HIV in Botswana. Using existing committees within communities and building new connections to government service providers could help spread information. The participatory process of sharing findings with stakeholders and discussing local solutions is generalizable to others working with hard-to-reach populations."

However, little is known about HIV epidemiology, management and response in HIV positive women living in different areas of Canada, nor the impact of women-specific HIV/AIDS services on sexual, reproductive, mental and women's health. This study aims to assess the proportion, distribution and pattern of women-specific HIV/AIDS service use, and the effect of such use on reproductive health (e.g. fertility intention, contraceptive use, pregnancy experience), sexual health (STI risk, sexual satisfaction and functioning), mental health (depression, anxiety, PTSD) and women's health (e.g. menstruation, menopause, cervical dysplasia, breast cancer) among women living with HIV in Canada.  It is hypothesized that women-specific HIV/AIDS service use will be lowest in rural areas and among younger, Aboriginal and new immigrant women and those who report high levels of stigma; and that HIV positive women who report higher use and uptake of women-specific HIV/AIDS service will report better sexual, reproductive, mental and women's health outcomes. 
This multi-site, community-collaborative, prospective cohort study will enroll 1,050 HIV positive women from British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. Peer research assistants (PRAs) will provide participant outreach and recruitment. Participants will complete a PRA-administered survey at baseline and two years, with a phone call and brief survey at one year to ensure continuity of contact. Survey data will be linked to existing national and provincial cohorts. Further funding will be sought to follow the cohort longitudinally and include other provinces.

Aboriginal people accounted for 4.3% of the population in 2011, but represented an estimated 12.2% of diagnosed HIV infections in the same year. Aboriginal women in particular share a greater proportion of HIV infections in comparison to non-Aboriginal women.  Between 1998 and 2009, Aboriginal females made up nearly half (49%) of all positive HIV test reports among Aboriginal people, compared to 20% for non-Aboriginal females for the same period.  The overrepresentation of Aboriginal women in HIV cases and the under-representation of Aboriginal women involved in HIV research suggest the voices of Aboriginal women are not being heard.  These gaps continue to impede the development of culturally relevant approaches to address the HIV epidemic amongst this community.  There is a specific need for research involving Aboriginal women that goes beyond biomedical and epidemiologic research and instead is investing in addressing social and economic factors that influence the lives of Aboriginal women living with or affected by HIV and AIDS. With this planning grant meeting we propose to 1) bring together members of the multidisciplinary Aboriginal Women's Research Initiative team including Aboriginal Community Research Consultants (ACRCs) and the advisory board for a two day in-person meeting to establish a research agenda and discuss additional grant applications, 2) foster an environment of sharing, learning and collaboration between community members and researchers, 3) gain an understanding of current HIV care and education practices for Positive Aboriginal Women (PAW) across Canada, 4) establish culturally appropriate research priorities to address gaps in HIV research, education and healthcare for PAW that could be narrowed by research."

CHIWOS is a national, multi-site, inter-disciplinary, community-based research, longitudinal prospective cohort study. It has been working on defining and assessing WCC and determining the patterns of such care in BC, ON and QC among 1,400 women with HIV living through peer research associate-administered questionnaires at baseline and 18 months later. The CHIWOS team has developed a model and survey tool to measure WCC.  Early analyses have revealed regional, racial/ethnic, and age-related differences in the use and impact of WCC, which is important to consider when developing programs or policies that benefit women.  Building on CHIWOS-Phase 1, the CHIWOS-Renewal will continue CHIWOS data collection with the addition of two more time points every 18 months (until 2019) as there is increasing uptake of a WCC model by frontline care systems. Another exciting aspect of the renewal will be to expand the study to include Saskatchewan and Manitoba. Finally, we intend to build on our model of WCC by adding a life course approach to caring for women with HIV; a concept deemed to be crucial by our peer research associates and community partners.  The new scientific contribution of the CHIWOS renewal will consist of both a quantitative analysis and an additional qualitative component to assess the impact of age on the experience and need for WCC by women living with HIV in Canada. Our proposed study aims to generate new research findings that will help fill urgent gaps in knowledge and to inform policy and programming about the care and health of women with HIV in Canada in all their diversities over their life course."
Attitudes and Practices of Psychologists in Canada Regarding the Driving Fitness of Older Adults,"['Love, Janet A']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Driving', 'Driving Cessation', 'Health', 'Health Care', 'Injury', 'Mobilty', 'Older Adults', 'Physicians', 'Psychologists']",105000.0,184617,"In Canada, the older population is growing and living longer, thereby engaging in activities of daily living for a greater number of years. Older adults often continue to drive until an accident alerts authorities and family that the safety of the driver, and the general population, may be compromised. Older drivers are more likely to be involved in an accident and compared to younger adults, are more likely to die in a crash or experience lengthier recovery processes, thereby incuring greater health care costs to themselves and to the system. 
Canadian physicians' reported that they do not believe they are the most qualified to assess fitness to drive, particularly as related to cognitive function. It may be that there are other health care proffessionals who are better able to assess an older adult whose cognitive abilities are declining. Psychologists may be one such group involved in the assessments of older adults with cognitive impairments. 
This research examins attitudes and practices of psychologist across canada and will further help us understand the issue of aging and mobility.  Determining how psychologists perceive the issues may be useful for the development of educational programs (for older adults, the population, and psychologists), and assist in the creation of standardized applications for assessment. This may ultimately lead to decreased risk for older adults being involved in crashes thereby, resulting in lower levels of personal injury, decreasing health care costs, individual health-strain, and ultimately saving lives."
Familial Histories of Comorbid Conditions for Predicting Fracture Risk using Population-Based Record Linkage,"['Love, Matthew J']",['N/A'],"['Administrative Data', 'Family History', 'Fracture', 'Longitudinal', 'Osteoporosis']",5000.0,383533,"Fractures due to weak bones are a major public health problem because they decrease one's quality of life and work productivity, and increase one's use of health services. An accurate tool to predict who is at high risk of having a fracture can lead to timely treatment to reduce bone loss. However, current fracture prediction tools miss more than half of all individuals who end up having a fracture in the future. A family or personal history of chronic conditions, like high blood pressure and high blood sugar, might help to accurately predict who is at risk of having a fracture due to weak bones, but there has been little research on this topic. This summer research project will explore the use of family history information about chronic diseases to predict fracture risk. The student researcher will have the opportunity to work with a data resource from Manitoba that is unique worldwide in collecting reliable family health history for a large number of people without relying on self-report information, which is not always very accurate. The student will learn how to use  administrative health data, which includes records of hospital stays, visits to doctors and medication use, to study public health problems. The student will also learn how to construct reliable, longitudinal family histories of diseases for a person. This research is important to the continued improvement of fracture prevention programs.

The pathway from prenatal pregnancy-specific anxiety to offspring ADHD through epigenetic age acceleration DNA methylation and moderators to target intervention: Partner social support,"['Lowe, Catherine']",['N/A'],"['Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder', 'Development', 'Dna Methylation', 'Epigenetic', 'Maternal Distress', 'Mediation', 'Moderation', 'Pregnancy-Specific Anxiety', 'Social Support', 'Structural Equation Modelling']",105000.0,475968,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects up to 10% of children, characterized by inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity, and poor executive function (EF). Maternal distress, such as pregnancy-specific anxiety (PSA), affects 10-25% of pregnant women and is related to poor offspring EF and attention. The fetal programming hypothesis posits that in-utero experiences affect genetic expression by fine-tuning offspring phenotype specific to the anticipated postnatal environment. The current understanding of how PSA programs fetal phenotype and subsequently increases the risk for ADHD is unknown. One pathway may be through changes to offspring DNA methylation (DNAm). Evidence indicates that maternal anxiety broadly predicts infant epigenetic biological age acceleration through DNAm, but whether these differences are associated with child ADHD symptoms or whether PSA also predicts it is unknown. Further, whether environmental factors such as relationship quality and partner support moderate PSA on offspring ADHD phenotype is unknown. The proposed project aims to examine trajectories and associations between maternal PSA, partner support, infant epigenetic age, and offspring ADHD. Pregnant women (N = 117) reported PSA and partner support at two-time points during pregnancy. Blood samples were collected from offspring at 3 months and 8 years of age and assayed for DNAm. Children were followed annually for 12 years, and reports of attention, EF, and ADHD diagnosis were obtained. Mediation/moderation regression analysis and structural equation modelling will test all hypotheses. Maternal distress, such as PSA, threatens offspring EF and attention and increases the risk of ADHD. Identifying relationships between PSA, offspring DNAm, ADHD characteristics over time, and whether partner support moderates these relationships have implications for prevention and intervention and, therefore, outcomes for child developmental health."

We are applying for support to host Cafes in St John's, NL and Montreal, QC. The theme of our Cafes is 'Does our Sex/Gender and our Environment Affect our Health?' Each Cafe will focus on a topic related to this main theme. As a starting point for public discussion, films will be screened about the topics. A panel of scholars from the CIHR GEH Team will be at the Cafes to engage in discussion with the audience. 

How environmental toxins impact men and women's health is the topic of our Montreal Cafe, at which we will show the film Homo Toxicus. We live in a world in which toxins are global in nature and may be found in the products we use and the places we live, work and play. Some questions that will be addressed include: Are men and women exposed in the same way to toxins? Are the effects on their health the same? How do men and women experience the social consequences of these health problems? The work we do can also affect our health. Workers' health is the topic of our St John's Cafe. We will show films focusing on two case studies in occupational health: male migrant farm workers in Ontario; and female crab processing workers in Newfoundland. Some questions that will be addressed include: How does our gender shape the work we do? How does our gender shape the impact of our work on our health?"

Therefore, it is important to develop a health program directed at improving the health of people living with osteoarthritis in underserved rural communities of Yucatan. The main objective of this project is to develop a community based program to improve the health of individuals living with osteoarthritis in Chikindzonot, a community located in the countryside of Yucatan, Mexico. To accomplish this, we will conduct the following steps in which we will: 1) determine which evidence based interventions are available to improve the health of people with osteoarthritis; 2) investigate the extent to which osteoarthritis affects the health of Chikindzonot's habitants and will examine reasons why people are getting this disease; 3) explore the community's beliefs and perceptions about osteoarthritis; 4) form a discussion group with various people from the community; 5) present the information that has been  assembled in the previous steps of this project to community members; and 6) ask community members to make a judgment about the components of the health program that should be adopted to improve the health of individuals living with osteoarthritis in Chikindzonot. The results of this project will help us to understand the process of developing and creating community based programs, and will help the community of Chikindzonot to define what is needed to improve the health status of its members living with osteoarthritis and to determine how they can cover these needs."

3.Investigate early developmental origins of mental and cardio-metabolic health, starting at conception 
4.Build new opportunities for Indigenous students and community researchers to obtain training and participate in public health research and policy development, preparing for future leadership
5.Share our findings with our own and other Indigenous communities, and join with other Indigenous groups to improve health and wellness for our children across Canada.
Mi'kmaq Elder Albert Marshall described ""two-eyed seeing"" as an approach that uses the best strengths of both Indigenous and Western scientific ways of knowing for the benefit of all. Two-eyed seeing will inform all of our work. We are also guided by the FNHA's strengths-based perspective on health and wellness - encouraging the acknowledgment of challenges such as the ongoing legacy of colonialism, while also building the conditions for building resilience. We hope that our findings will benefit all children and families within our NTC communities, as well as Indigenous and other children and families more broadly."

The project is informed by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada's report on the multi-generational traumatic experiences of residential school survivors. For more than 100 years, thousands of Indigenous children were forcibly removed from their homes and communities and stripped of their Indigenous identities, eradicating cultural, family and kinship structures. Yet our communities are resilient. We have survived. Even so, most research has failed to articulate Indigenous pathways for optimal health and wellness. Our I-HeLTI research will use traditional Indigenous Knowledge to inform and reclaim positive pathways for promoting and sustaining healthy child development, measuring the wellbeing of children and families over time, while also healing from traumas that manifest as chronic health conditions such as mental health and cardiometabolic problems, or non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Research on reducing the burden of NCDs is crucial to Nation Rebuilding. By engaging with Elders, community leaders, Knowledge Holders and researcher allies, we will meet our goals of understanding how social and biological processes and mechanisms along with community-led programs may be optimized for children's benefit in reducing NCDs. In the words of the late Alice Paul, Nuu-chah-nulth Elder: The highest law is to protect our offspring, because that is how we as a Nation of people shall survive.

Knowing that:
- Many children are overweight or obese by adolescent;
- Unhealthy drinking habits develop when young, especially the habit of drinking sugary drinks; 
- Sugary drinks are how children get the most of their total sugar load;
- Too much sugar is linked to being overweight or obese; 
- Water is the best drink when thirsty;
- Parents' drinking habits and how they feed their children has a big impact on what children drink;
- School, home and leisure areas are places where an impact on kids' habits can be made.

Because few research projects have looked at this problem in terms of kids choosing to drink more water instead of sugary drinks, we don't know scientifically how much such a shift can improve healthy weight in school-aged children. 

The Water Schools project will take place in the schools and in the homes of participating students. It will focus on a major aspect linked to unhealthy weight gain among school-aged children - drinking habits. It will install filtered tap water stations in schools, create educational videos and school activities, and will take a well rounded approach towards improving the health of 5-11 year olds by increasing the amount of tap water consumed instead of sugary drinks.

Our findings will provide information to help change kids' schools and homes into places that will make it easier for kids and their families to improve healthy weight by having good drinking habits. In the long term we hope this project will also raise awareness about the importance of good drinking water and the fact that water is a human right that should remain free and accessible to all. Canada's water heritage might be part of the challenge facing younger generations to help them acquire healthy beverage behaviours."

It has been established that the widespread deforestation is leading to insidious health deterioration. As such, local populations are now exposed to mercury through fish consumption after lixiviation of the heavy metal from deforested soils and are at risk of contracting the trypanosomiasis (Chagas disease) as deforested lands favor the contact between humans and triatomines, insects carrying the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi. Within the scope of Global Health Research, the SLUBH project consists in connected sequences of conceptually related projects. It involves from its conception stage a team of interdisciplinary researchers, as well as decision-making partners of the public health, rural development and environmental protection sectors and community collaborators already positively participating for some times to our previous projects. We first intend to produce and integrate knowledge acquired through parallel scientific research and governmental /non-governmental interventions to draw a dynamic portrait of the potential evolution of the environmental health risks, both toxic and infectious, likewise to increasingly affect small scale farming communities under status quo. Then, we shall identify complementarities as well as antagonisms within the governance system regarding population health interventions, rural development incentives and environmental laws, which are superimposed on the colonization processes of the Brazilian Amazon.

This project examines the history of the SDOH in Canada by analyzing CPHA's archival materials from 1910 to 2010. Specifically, it is concerned with identifying key historical figures (e.g., promoters and detractors), exploring perceived barriers and facilitators to action on the SDOH, and identifying prominent points of emphasis and contention in this history. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of CPHA's archival materials (onsite and at the Library and Archives Canada), which included annual reports, meeting minutes, resolutions and briefings. We found that while new in name, the SDOH have remained at the heart of CPHA's activities since its earliest decades. This includes CPHA's longstanding concern with improving the living conditions of Canadians understood to be detrimental to health (e.g., housing, poverty, employment). While this work is currently in progress, at the time of presentation key historical milestones specific to the SDOH will have been discerned.There is much to be learned from the CPHA's longstanding history (est. 1910) as a non-governmental organization committed to improving the health of Canadians.

Most of the food that people buy are from food stores. Since the types and cost of foods available to customers in food stores can influence what they eat, it is important to understand the cost of a healthy diet and how food stores can offer healthy and affordable foods to customers. The Nutritious Food Basket is a tool made by the Canadian government and used by Canadian provinces to track the cost of healthy eating. The Food Basket is a list of the amounts and types of foods that make up a healthy diet for a family of four. The food items in the Food Basket are based on the most popular foods eaten by Canadians and that meet dietary recommendations from a 2004 Canadian survey which reported the amount of certain foods that Canadians ate. The provinces then go into a set number of food stores and price the items in the Food Basket to get the overall cost of the Food Basket.  Recently, the Canadian government released the results of a new Canadian survey which reported on the foods Canadians ate and updated Canada's Food Guide. Based on this new information this project will look to update the foods in the Nutritious Food Basket and understand if less healthy foods that still meet Canadian healthy eating guidelines can be used to create a less expensive food basket. Two food baskets will be created; one that includes foods that make up a healthy diet and another based on what Canadians reported eating. Both baskets will be priced in 14 Nova Scotian food stores and be compared to see if there are any differences in the price and nutritional quality of food items between the two baskets. Management staff from 5-10 of the food stores studied will be interviewed to understand what makes it difficult for them to sell healthy and less expensive foods to customers. The project results will be used to create health policies to improve healthy eating and prevent disease in Canada."

Feasibility of Quebec administrative health databases linkage for studying First Nations and Inuit birth outcomes,"['Luo, Zhong-Cheng']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal Birth Outcomes', 'Administrative Health Databases Linkage']",25000.0,173151,"There has been a lack of data on Aboriginal (First Nations, Inuit, Métis) birth outcomes in Canada at the national-level, and a lack of population-based data on Aboriginal birth outcomes in most provinces. Available research data suggest that First Nations and Inuit birth outcomes are much worse than their non-Aboriginal counterparts. The causes and causal mediating factors are poorly understood. We have the experience in using the Statistics Canada's linked perinatal data in research of Quebec First Nations and Inuit birth outcomes. A major limitation of Statistics Canada's linked vital data is its very limited number of variables on maternal and pregnancy characteristics, therefore the inability for more in depth analyses on the causes and consequences of adverse birth outcomes.

Understanding the Constructions of Loneliness in Older Adults' Lived Experiences and Practices: An Ethnographic Inquiry,"['Lu, Si Yinn']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Critical Gerontology', 'Ethnography', 'Inequality', 'Loneliness', 'Qualitative Research', 'Social Isolation']",470.0,498011,"Loneliness has been recognized as a global public health concern. Older people are regarded to be at a higher 'risk' of experiencing loneliness due to a greater likelihood of living alone, health-related problems, and reduction of social ties and support, challenges that were exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies have also demonstrated the adverse effects of loneliness on older people's longevity, physical/psychological well-being, and quality of life. Singapore is experiencing an accelerated rate of population aging, with the country set to become a 'super-aged' society by 2026, with one-fifth of the population aged 65 and above. The Singapore government has prioritized loneliness as a 'threat' to the health of an aging populace, with a slew of community programs designed to promote the building of social connections and an active lifestyle among older people. While the field of research on loneliness among older people provides insights into the risk factors, outcomes, and interventions to address loneliness, lesser attention is paid to understanding how older people experience loneliness in their everyday lives, and how these experiences are shaped by broader social and structural mechanisms. This research plans to adopt a critical ethnographic approach to explore how socio-cultural, economic, and cultural factors influence older people's experiences of loneliness in the Singapore context. The proposed research aims to shift the analysis of loneliness as an individual 'problem' that places the primary responsibility on older people to fix, to an understanding of loneliness as linked to broader ageist structures and inequities. These findings can inform the design of community/system-level policies and practices that are centered on equity, inclusion, and do not reproduce loneliness and marginalization among older people."
Building a theory-based approach to evaluation of small development NGOs: a case study from Canada,"['Lu, Stephanie K']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],900.0,345324,"The Sustainable Development Goals have ushered in a new era for the global health community, including Canadian NGOs. While numerous NGOs have made it their mission to address unmet needs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), few prioritize evaluation because they lack expertise and/or feel strongly about funding programs and not processes, given accountability to donors. Our research explores gaps in evaluative practice in small NGOs in a water, sanitation, and hygiene (WaSH) context, in which millions of vulnerable people lack access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities. This presentation focuses on examining facilitators and barriers to organizational level evaluation and proposes a plan to develop cost-effective evaluation tools in partnership with a WaSH NGO with no prior evaluation experience. As a case study, we are evaluating H2O4All-a Canadian NGO that has implemented over 35 WaSH projects in LMICs. Mixed methods evaluation activities, following Patton's utilization-focused approach, are underway; these include in-depth interviews, focus groups, surveys, and a social network analysis. Preliminary findings from our case study suggest that a lack of evaluative thinking inhibits small NGOs from finding their niche, raising funds, and thereby expanding reach. Without measurable outcomes to guide development, the impact of WaSH interventions could be negligible or even harmful to intended beneficiaries. Theory-based approaches to evaluation are well worth the investment for small NGOs. By uncovering underlying assumptions about WaSH interventions and building capacity for internal evaluation through workshops and accessible tools, NGOs can increase knowledge exchange, transparency, and be held accountable to improving health and wellbeing in LMICs."
A utilization-focused toolkit for evaluating small NGOs in international development,"['Lu, Stephanie K']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Award'],1500.0,364666,"With the introduction of the Sustainable Development Goals, the level of sophistication required to measure the impact of international development has grown. However, NGOs have been slow to invest in evaluation; instead of using evidence-based tools to enhance performance, NGOs engage in activities to demonstrate their good work. To support NGOs, particularly small ones with limited resources, strategies for cost-effective tools are needed. Our research has aimed to do away with the prioritization of individual projects with short-term impact by undertaking an organizational level evaluation of a small NGO in water-based development. Our case study is of H2O 4 ALL-a Canadian NGO that has implemented over 40 projects in water-based development in low-income countries. Using a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods, we have created and piloted an evaluation toolkit comprising of a logic model, online stakeholder surveys, and a project implementation checklist. We have also identified specific facilitators and barriers to embedding evaluative thinking in an NGO. Findings suggest that measuring impact systematically does not have to be resource-intensive. The greater barriers to evaluation include the persisting notion that evaluative thinking is only done by the evaluator, limited opportunities for group learning, and giving critique when the organization is run by a small group of staff. Even though our evaluation focused on water-based development, our toolkit is transferable to other small NGOs running similar programs."
Video games for obesity interventions: A new generation of health messaging for adolescents,"['Luth, Westerly']",['N/A'],"['Adolescents', 'Childhood Obesity', 'Content Coding', 'Experimental Study', 'Health Promotion', 'Mixed-Method', 'Semi-Structured Interview', 'Video Games']",17500.0,254429,"Childhood obesity is an epidemic. Part of the problem is adolescents are spending more time in front of screens, which decreases active play and also exposes them to food advertising. Advertisements form a significant building block in the development of children's health attitudes by presenting foods and beverages of dubious nutritious quality favourably. Research has been done on print and television, but developing forms of advertising targeting children in new mediums also require attention. 

Video games are popular among adolescents. The popularity of video games makes them an attractive platform to advertisers. While using the results of research in traditional media like television and print, it is important to consider video games' defining feature: interactivity. The ability to interact with video games on an unprecedented level means that the effects of video game-based advertising must be examined as unique. 

Researching the effects of in-game advertising can identify how gamers respond to food and beverage advertising in video games. This will identify the scope of the behavioural influence of in-game video game advertising on adolescents, and the potential for video games to support healthy lifestyles. Video games may be a forum to reach adolescent audiences cynical with these traditional approaches. 

My research focuses on 12-13 year-olds of both genders. I will analyze the advertisements of food and beverages in current video games. I will observe youth gamers during video game play and monitor their short-term food preferences to determine the effects of in-game advertisements on their food and beverage consumption. I will interview parents and children to identify their beliefs and opinions regarding in-game advertising, counter-messaging and media literacy training. I will experimentally manipulate a video game to determine if replacing unhealthy advertisements with healthy alternatives can promote health eating."
Multi-ethnic polygenic risk scores to improve risk screening of complex diseases for populations of non-European ancestries,"['Lu, Tianyuan']",['N/A'],"['Cohort Study', 'Complex Diseases', 'Ethnicity', 'Genetic Risk Prediction', 'Machine Learning', 'Population Genetics']",150000.0,437116,"Genetic predisposition to disease is an important risk factor for many complex diseases. Advances in human genetics have enabled the development of efficient genetic scores, named polygenic risk scores, that aggregate information across millions of genetic features to predict disease risks. In combination with effective application of high-dimensional statistics, machine learning and artificial intelligence, the predictive power of recently developed polygenic risk scores is increasing and indicating high clinical utility. However, nearly all of these advances have occurred using data from individuals of European ancestry. 
The effectiveness of polygenic risk scores in individuals of non-European ancestries is still largely unknown. But in the cases where it has been evaluated, the predictive performance of polygenic risk scores is substantially attenuated. This is likely due to differences in the underlying genetic basis of disease in different populations, together with varying environmental exposures. To date, there are no clinically-acceptable polygenic risk scores available to people of non-European ancestries, though these populations, including minorities and aboriginals, who support the health care system and its patients, make up very important proportions of the population of Canada and of many other countries.
Therefore, having gathered several large population-based cohorts of different ethnic background, we aim to develop novel machine learning methods, together with open source software packages to improve the accuracy of polygenic risk scores for complex diseases, such as various types of cancer, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and osteoporosis, for individuals of non-European ancestries. We anticipate that these polygenic risk scores applicable to multiple ethnic groups will help not only realize the goals of generalizability and clinical utility, but also mitigate long-standing health care disparities."

Individuals born preterm are also more likely to have several of these co-occurring signs, thus increasing their risk of multimorbidity (2 or more chronic diseases). Multimorbidity can affect quality of life and is associated with higher mortality. Our study aims to assess risk of chronic diseases, more specifically multimorbidity, and mortality for males and females aged 15-43 years who were born preterm compared to full-term. To do so, we will use administrative database to track occurrence of chronic diseases (cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, chronic kidney diseases, mental disorders, cancer) in all individuals born preterm (before 37 weeks) from 1976 to 1995 in the province of Quebec. Each individual born preterm will be matched to two individuals born full-term. There is currently no recommendations regarding long-term health monitoring of individuals born preterm.

A new -found interest in institutionalized health care for Aboriginal people emerged with the creation of the department of National Health and Welfare in 1945, and expenditures were justified by reference to the threat that Aboriginal people (Native and Inuit)posed to the ""national health.""  Tuberculosisi in particular captured medical and public attention.  But existing provincial and municipal sanatoria were most often unavailable to Aboriginal patients because tax payers "" white""patients were given priority.  Even as these institutions were forced to shut for a lack of patients, federal efforts to institutionalize Aboriginal people in ""Indian Hospitals"" continued apace.  At the same time medical bureaucrats contended that their efforts in no way acknowledged a treaty or statutory rithgt to health care, that they were motivated by humanitarian concerns alone.  Institutionalizing Aboriginal people, whether in the interests of larger goals of education or health care, stands out as a persistent government policy.  The archival record provides insight into medical and government policy, and it is possible to listen for Aboriginal voices in the docuements. But it remains to explore the experiences of patients who often spent years in these institutions, and the Aboriginal workers who cared for them.  A clearer understanding of the role of institutional health care and its relationship to the consturction of the welfare state will inform current health care practices for Aboriginal people."
A modified regression approach for modeling small sample and non-normal distributed longitudinal outcome,"['Lu, Zihang']",['N/A'],"['Biostatistics', 'Growth Trajectories Modeling', 'Longitudinal Data Analysis', 'Lung Function Development', 'Non-Normal Distributed Outcomes', 'Simulation Studies', 'Small Sample Size']",105000.0,365478,"The relationship between the growth trajectories, rates of change of a longitudinal measurement and a future outcome are usually of great interest in epidemiology and clinical research. Many statistical modelling approaches have been proposed over the past decades to model the growth trajectories, such as regression calibration methods, bivariate growth methods and structural equation modellings. However, these existing methods require the normality assumptions to be made to estimate the coefficients and standard errors, and may only be appropriate for data with large sample size. Misuses of these approaches may result in bias estimates of parameters of interest and thus lead to misleading conclusions. My research aims to investigate the properties of different existing modeling approaches under the scenarios when the sample size is small and the outcome is not distributed normally and to develop a novel regression approach to overcome the aforementioned issues which usually encounters in real data. The statistical methods evaluated and the new proposed method will be illustrated using the real data from an ongoing general population longitudinal study, the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study. The findings from my research will provide accurate and stable estimates when modeling longitudinal data with small sample size and non-normal distributed outcomes and aid in the discovery of lung protective and early diagnostic strategies."
A Novel Approach to Nutritional Behaviour Development in Children,"['Lynch, Meghan B']",['N/A'],"['Case Study', 'Child Development', ""Children'S Perspectives"", 'Community-Based', 'Developmental Psychology', 'Ecological Theory', 'Nutritional Behaviour', 'Social Influences']",150000.0,197237,"Preschool children are one of the most important groups for studying the establishment of lifelong nutritional behaviours. Research has confirmed the paramount role the social environment plays in the formation of these behaviours, yet little is known about the full range and interactions of the social influences. Additionally, to understand why only certain children engage in healthy nutritional behaviours, more research is needed in examining how children interpret nutrition-related messages. Thus, this study will examine messages from various social influences in a case study of Canadian children under six years of age. More specifically, this study will answer two questions: 1) What are the messages regarding nutritional behaviours (preferences, portion sizes, etc.) being delivered to children in the home and school and by the media? And 2) What are the children's perceptions of the nutritional environment? To achieve an in-depth understanding, this study will draw on case-study and community-based approaches, and aspects of Bronfenbrenner's Theory of Ecological Development (1979). Four different methods of data collection will be employed: observations in different settings, content analysis of television programs, interviews with the children's primary social influences, and play-based assessments. Examining the diversity of messages regarding nutritional behaviour and the children's perception of these messages will have implications for nutrition research and practice in Canada (and elsewhere). Working with the community, especially the parents, to generate ways to promote healthy development is central. Also, the identification of children's perceptions through play-based assessments would encourage the further use of play-based assessments as a method for understanding children's perceptions of nutrition.

For most people these problems will first appear by age 25, and it is likely they will experience two or more mental health conditions simultaneously, leading to greater symptom severity and poorer treatment outcomes. Globally, mental health problems among young people have increased over the last two decades, and there is an urgent need to invest in prevention and early intervention. A major obstacle for effective prevention is our poor understanding of how, why, when and for whom co-occurring mental health problems develop. New data-driven approaches to studying mental health that accommodate overlapping symptoms and conditions can overhaul our understanding of comorbid mental health problems. Applying these approaches to data from two multimodal longitudinal studies involving young Canadians, I will conduct a series of studies to better understand the predictors, developmental course, and prevention mechanisms of co-occurring psychopathology in young people. I will map developmental trajectories of comorbid psychopathology and identify important predictors and early risk markers. It is hypothesised that different individual, interpersonal and contextual characteristics will predict different patterns of comorbid psychopathology, which will shed light on who is most vulnerable, how their conditions develop over time and when the best time to intervene is. I will also evaluate the impact of an evidence-based mental health prevention program (PreVenture) and investigate potential mechanisms of change to understand how the program works. It is hypothesised that PreVenture will impact the development of comorbid psychopathology via changes to cognitive, emotional, and interpersonal processes. This work will fill existing knowledge gaps and enhance the precision and effectiveness of programs aimed at preventing mental health conditions among young people."
Developing and Testing a Culturally Adapted Personality Focused Intervention to Prevent Substance Use Among First Nations Youth Across Canada,"['Lynds, Trent M']",['N/A'],"['Alcohol And Substance Use', 'Community-Based Research', 'Cultural Adapted Substance Use Prevention Program', 'First Nations Youth', 'Personality Vulnerabilities']",105000.0,497134,"Differences in personality may explain why some people are more likely than others to develop alcohol and substance use difficulties. PreVenture is a group-based substance use prevention program that targets personality traits among youth. The program has been shown to be effective in preventing substance use and reducing mental health difficulties. PreVenture targets four personality traits associated with substance use: anxiety sensitivity (i.e., fear of anxiety-related bodily sensations; rapid heartbeat, dizziness, etc.), hopelessness (i.e., risk of having low mood), impulsivity (i.e., acting without considering consequences), and sensation seeking (i.e., enjoying new and intense experiences).
Alcohol and substance use are a primary concern for the health and wellness of First Nations (FNs) youth. However, research on evidence-based substance use prevention programs among FNs youth is limited. Initial cultural adaptations of Preventure were effective in reducing substance use among Mi'kmaq youth. While these findings are encouraging, FNs youth across Canada could also benefit from a culturally adapted PreVenture program. This project will adapt and test a FNs PreVenture, aimed to prevent substance use among FNs youth across Canada. The project will involve collaborating with FNs communities, Elders, and youth across the country, and will be in partnership with a FNs led mental health organization in Northwestern Ontario. The project could foster the prevention of substance use among FNs youth and would highlight the importance of research partnerships with FNs communities and organizations."

Jointly we aim to do the following: 1) to study the Indigenous concept of wellness, called mino-bimaadiziwin from the perspective of Indigenous people using Indigenous methods. Mino-bimaadiziwin is a holistic concept of health focused on leading a good life. It goes much beyond the western individualistic physically-focused model of health. We will study this concept in close collaboration with traditional Indigenous healing services providers and knowledge holders. 2) once we have documented the concept of wellness as it is understood today, we will engage health and mental health services providers to explore strategies to integrate with traditional Indigenous healing services more effectively using mino-bimaadiziwin as a guiding principle; and 3) to develop ways to track improvements in Indigenous wellness based on the concept of mino-bimaadiziwin. These topics have been identified in several health services reports as a key priority by Indigenous health authorities and communities on Manitoulin Island. Our research will provide important insights into how traditional healing services, mental health, and primary care services can align with the aspirations for wellness in Indigenous communities. We hope to specifically engage with Indigenous people affected by the Indian residential school system. Findings will provide important insight into how Indigenous concepts of wellness might be incorporated into future Indigenous health research. In addition, they will have important implications for health services administration and heath service evaluation."

The community has many thriving Anishinabe people, pristine waters and lands, strong language, culture, and heritage; but the consequences of centuries of colonial oppression are also present. The most serious health issue is the opioid crisis. It has resulted in social problems, chronic drug-related illnesses, mental health issues, family violence, loss of children into foster care, trafficking of women, crime, vandalism, and breakdown of the social fabric and relationships in the community. Tribal police estimate that for each addicted person there are ten family members whose health and mental health is affected by drug-related consequences.

The community is proactive in addressing opioid use and there is a strong commitment to move away from a punitive approach. The community offers opioid agonist therapy (OAT) to treat these addictions. In the clinic, patients are supported with culturally based therapies and counseling. Our pilot research shows documented promising results associated with this community-owned, culturally safe approach, but it also emphasizes that more research is needed to identify promising practices.

Our community-based, patient-engaged research will involve clients, family and community members in community-based solutions. We will work with Elders, knowledge keepers and clients in recovery to increase our understanding of the role of the land, Anishinabe language and worldview and their relationship to healing from opioid addiction. Research with providers across diverse sectors will create an Indigenous model of essential services for opioid recovery, and support the uptake results into policy, practice and service development. Finally, we will create access to robust health, social, and justice data sets and administrative data-bases in order to evaluate services, in order to empower the community to make knowledge-based decisions."

For example, they may have difficulty thinking flexibly, in terms of adapting their thinking to suit the changing needs of tasks. They may also have trouble thinking about the big picture, instead focusing on small details. Some researchers have explored whether people with other eating disorders, such as bulimia, have the same types of thinking difficulties, but currently it is not clear whether this is the case. This study investigates the types of thinking problems that people with different types of eating disorders might have, including how they compare to one another and to people without any eating disorder. It is predicted that people with bulimia and a more general eating disorder will also have difficulties in some types of thinking. This study will also look at whether problems with thinking before entering treatment can tell us how people will respond to hospital treatment, and it is predicted that greater impairments will be related to poorer treatment outcomes. Lastly, this study examines whether problems with thinking are improved after regular hospital treatment, and it is predicted that these thinking styles will change moderately after treatment. This study will ask people with eating disorders to complete a number of tasks looking at thinking style. Their results will be compared to people without eating disorders, and will also be examined in relation to treatment outcomes. This will help researchers to better understand what types of problems in thinking people with eating disorders might have, and how this relates to treatment. Because eating disorders require intensive treatment, and because many patients often do not ever fully recover, better understanding may help us to improve treatments for Canadians with eating disorders, as well as to reduce the health care costs associated with eating disorders."

Thus, the necessity of thoughtful, community-based research is increasing urgently. 

Our academic-community team believes that more should be done to mobilize scientific evidence to improve health outcomes and services in the North. We also believe that an intersectoral framework is needed to assess baseline conditions, monitor development impacts, and for proactive preventative planning. This team is uniquely positioned to employ the intersectoral lenses of environment, culture, education, and health.

Phase 1 will involve initial collaborative meetings in Chisasibi and in Kuujjuaq, to generate, prioritize and explore health and related community development issues. Phase 2 will involve analysis of the discussions generated, in order to establish short and long-term priorities for team efforts. In Phase 3, potential projects will be identified, based on priorities outlined in Phase 2. Short-term projects will be designed and started where possible, and additional funding will be sought where necessary.

Anticipated outcomes include strengthening and broadening collaborative relationships with key stakeholders in northern communities; identification of health research priorities; gathering of research evidence useful to stakeholders; development of methodology to facilitate the intersectoral research process; identification of opportunities for knowledge translation, capacity building, improving community services, and of areas for further research and development of partnerships; and development of operating grant applications to address priority health issues."

Deviations in the normative function of the HPAA have been linked to a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders. Understanding the origin behind differences in HPAA function is therefore critical to the field of mental health care. During pregnancy, the first six weeks after conception (peri-conceptional period) represent a critical window of vulnerability in which exposure to stress can impact the HPAA and later development of a child. Any changes as a result of stress to the DNA of the first initial cells are transmitted into all resulting daughter cells, thus impacting the development of biological systems throughout the body. While studies have investigated the influence maternal stress has on the later development of a child, these studies typically recruit women only after they learn they are pregnant, thereby missing the peri-conceptional period. We are interested in the impact peri-conceptional maternal stress has on the programming of the stress response system and later development outcomes of the child. To do this, we will build upon a long-term study initiated by Dr. Nepomnaschy in 2000. This study evaluated the stress response system and DNA profiles of women at risk of conceiving a pregnancy in rural Guatemala. Children conceived during that time are now 11-12 years old. Our aim is to re-contact those mother-child dyads and compare our data collected over 10 years ago with new interviews and bio-specimens of both mother and child. We aim to investigate the relationships and associations between peri-conceptional maternal stress and the child's stress response systems and DNA profiles at puberty. As the first study of its kind, our results will fuel the implementation of intervention strategies designed to minimize exposures at sensitive periods and reduce negative outcomes as a result of maternal peri-conceptional stress."

Understanding community level antibiotic resistance patterns is essential to understanding the risk of developing many types of antibiotic resistant infections. Currently, a public system of tracking regional (community level) antimicrobial resistance patterns across a diversity of pathogens does not exist. Through a partnership between the University of Toronto, Division of Infectious Diseases and the Harvard Centre for Biomedical Informatics, we intend to develop an open, collaborative, global database of antimicrobial resistance. This will be achieved through the use of publicly available antibiograms (indexes of resistance) as well as, through a web-based collaboration supporting open-source uploading from laboratories and hospitals in Canada and around the world. Antibiotic susceptibility will be displayed through an interactive web-based map, and will change in real-time based on user-defined selections.

This aim will be achieved in collaboration with the Nuu-chah-nulth Tribal Council (NTC)-Led, CIHR-funded, SFU-partnered Indigenous Healthy Life Trajectories Initiative (I-HeLTI) project. From its inception in 2017, the I-HeLTI project has embraced a community-led approach and has adopted a model of ongoing consultation with community-based service providers, community elders, and NTC leadership. Within this project, my proposed research involves the development, execution, and analysis of a cross-sectional survey of Nuu-chah-nulth people. This survey will measure individuals' relationships with the Nuu-chah-nulth Way of Life, a framework describing Nuu-chah-nulth traditional parenting practices. The survey will also collect demographic and geographic information, as well information about individuals' experiences of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) (mental health and cardiometabolic). We expect to see that adherence to traditional parenting practices lessens the impact of NCDs later in life. This information is important to Nuu-chah-nulth people because it will aid in the development of specific and evidence-based child and youth services programming and therefore have positive impacts on the health of future generations. This project's governance structure represents a radical change in tone regarding research involving Indigenous peoples, as it is research by and for the community, rather than on the community. Therefore, my research, and the wider I-HeLTI project, demonstrate a commitment to respectful involvement of Indigenous communities, and exemplify at least 5 of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report's Calls to Action (5, 12, 19, 22, 65)."

Employed men are essential to Canada's economy. Knowing how men promote their own well-being in situations of workplace bullying and what affects the way they work is important for sustaining a healthy workforce. In this grounded theory study, we will seek men to be interviewed individually about their workplace bullying experiences. We will examine how being bullied at work affects men's patterns of health promotion and their work. From this, we will provide a theoretical understanding of these experiences.

Longitudinal effects of cannabis legalization in a community cohort of Canadian adults,"['MacKillop, James']","['Balodis, Iris M', 'Busse, Jason W', 'Van Ameringen, Michael']","['Alcohol', 'Attitudes', 'Cannabis', 'Legalization', 'Motives', 'Opioids', 'Perceptions']",677024.0,419407,"On October 17, 2018, recreational cannabis was legalized in Canada. The consequences of this major legislative change are unknown and we have a rare opportunity to  evaluate its effects systematically.

In the month prior to legalization, we collected data on cannabis perceptions, cannabis use, and other substance use from 1502 adults in Ontario. Our internal funding has permitted subsequent assessments at 6- and 12-months (95% and 93% retention, respectively), and will permit a further assessment at 18-months post-legalization.

This Project Grant is to conduct additional follow-up assessments across a five-year period following legalization (24-, 30-, 36-, 42- , 48-, 54-, and 60-months). Specifically, the Primary Aims are to examine: (1) changes in attitudes and perceptions about cannabis; (2) changes in cannabis consumption practices; (3) psychological factors that affect changes following legalization (e.g., initiating, escalating, or reducing use). 

In addition, for exploratory purposes, the study has two Secondary Aims. The first is to examine how changes in cannabis use following legalization affects the use of other substances, both recreational (e.g., alcohol) and prescription (e.g., opioids). The second is to explore sex/gender differences in all of the preceding domains.

Collectively, the proposed study will make substantial contributions to understanding of the effects of recreational cannabis legalization in Canada and will have significant implications for other jurisdictions considering cannabis legalization around the world."

Current services need to allow for equal access and strive to prevent discrimination towards culturally diverse family caregivers (FCGs). This is particularly important as the health care system, under financial strain, will increasingly rely on them to provide care at the end of life. In order to provide culturally competence services, organizations need to move toward multicultural models of organizational development.However, research has yet to examine how PC services address the needs of FCGs of diverse populations, nor have FCGs had an adequate voice in identifying their unique cultural needs. The research objectives guiding this study are: (1) To ascertain the need which culturally diverse FCGs identify as necessary for sensitive and inclusive service in PC care. (2) To understand how a PC service currently addresses the needs of diverse FCGs.  Results of this study will be highly transferable across multiple disciplines implicated in the practice of both institutional and hospice P/EOL care. This includes nursing, medicine, social work, chaplaincy, and both clinical and counseling psychology. In addition, it will aid in the identification of some of the specific needs of diverse FCG's which will inform policy and enhance services across Canada."

Commonly, people are given antibiotics to treat their illness. Sometimes the antibiotics are the appropriate treatment and sometimes they are used inappropriately. However, the impacts of taking antibiotics before and after the illness are not well understood. In order to investigate the link between antibiotic use and illnesses from food, my project has five AIMS:
1. Describe the relationship between antibiotic use and illness from food as you move through the stages of the illness;
2. Determine the chance of developing an illness from food after antibiotic use;
3. Determine whether the chance of developing long-term consequences (eg. reactive arthritis) following an illness from food is related to using antibiotics after illness (both appropriate and inappropriate use);
4. Determine whether the healthcare costs and chance of dying are related to using antibiotics after illness (both appropriate and inappropriate use); and
5. Identify specific ways antibiotics are used inappropriately to help inform future antibiotic use guidelines.
For the entire ~4M population of British Columbia, for 2005-2014, I will look at information on all antibiotic prescriptions, healthcare costs, infections from food, long-term consequences, and other pertinent factors (eg. age, sex). I will conduct a review of the existing published literature and describe the types and amount of antibiotics used both before and after illness from food. I will test hypotheses to assess the relationships between antibiotic use, and developing illness, developing long-term consequences, healthcare costs and chance of dying. This novel assessment of existing health data from BC will advance our understanding of the link between antibiotic use and illness from food. The results of this project will inform and improve antibiotic prescribing guidelines in Canada and therefore will have a significant impact on the health of Canadians."

Cultural considerations in early intervention rehabilitation services: Lessons from Canada and India,"['MacLachlan, Janna L']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,412111,"Rationale: The mainstream approach to early intervention rehabilitation services for children with developmental delay in the Western world assumes that children who do not achieve age-linked skill norms require therapy to help them catch up. However, this doesn't resonate in the cultural views of every population around the world. Further, therapy is most effective when it matches the cultural values and socioeconomic situations of the people it is provided to. Acting with humility and thinking critically about practice approaches have been proposed as ways to improve rehabilitation practices in non-Western contexts.

Objectives: By examining research projects exploring experiences with early intervention in India and Nunavut, this paper will identify assumptions in Western rehabilitation norms that do not work in all contexts.

Approach: By using critical theory and critical reflections, this presentation examines mainstream rehabilitation norms in terms of their application in two culturally contexts: India and Nunavut, Canada. This is done through examination of research results from projects interviewing parents of children receiving rehabilitation services in each of the two locations. 

Results: Interviews with parents in Nunavut and India show very different experiences with developmental rehabilitation services. However, they share a theme of Western rehabilitation norms not always being a good fit. This lack of fit is attributed to assumptions that rehabilitation norms make with regards to culture, values and economic class. Social norms and understandings of how people are integrated into society differed between the two contexts, as did thoughts about the power inherent in the services they had been exposed to.  

Conclusions: Therapists should think critically before integrating Western research evidence or practice guidelines in non-Western contexts. Practicing with humility shows potential to improve practice."

For many members of Official Language Minority Communities (OLMC), the availability of speech and language pathology services is influenced by the bilingual language context and the socio-political context of the OLMC.  An OLMC refers to Canadians who speak French and live outside of Québec, and those who speak English and live in Québec. Members of OLMCs report higher rates of bilingualism than other Canadians. In addition to high rates of bilingualism, the ""minority"" status of English or French varies between communities: from ""islands"" surrounded by the majority language, to ""peninsulas"" that are close to majority language communities that share their language. For preschool-aged children, access to speech-language services in one's language(s) is especially important since early identification of speech and language disorders among children provides the necessary support and strategies to help them and their families. Bilingual families, speech-language pathologists, health service providers and teachers living and working in OLMCs are in dire need of information regarding typical and disordered speech and language development.  This Catalyst Grant will take the first step towards addressing this need.  The goal of this grant is to investigate the following question: How is the speech and language development of 4-year-old children in OLMCs influenced the age of language learning, the amount of exposure to each language, and the socio-political context? The long-term goal of this research program is to develop an evidence-based approach for assessing the speech and language abilities of bilingual children from OLMCs that accounts for these important factors."

Our own work found a more than five-fold increase in antipsychotic prescriptions for males aged 6 to 18 and among females age 13 and older in British Columbia.  In the US, Alexander et al. report an eight-fold increase in patient visits where a typical or atypical antipsychotic drug was reported between 1995 and 2005 among patients under the age of 18.  And yet, Health Canada has not approved any antipsychotic medications for children.  Although controlled trials have shown that second generation or atypical antipsychotics are less likely to have neurological side effects, serious adverse metabolic side effects including weight gain, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and hypertension have been found.  On the other hand clinical studies have pointed to improved social functioning by patients receiving these treatments, and clinicians point to the potential benefits that would result if these drugs allowed children to stay in school.  Assessing the current state of knowledge about these drugs, Dr. Jonathan Mink, a consult to the FDA's Pediatric Advisory Committee said, ""There is serious concern that children may be at a higher risk for serious adverse effects and we just don't have sufficient data to answer that question.""  This study will provide key evidence on long-term risks and benefits of these drugs, information that is critically needed by doctors, patients and parents so that they can make informed assessments of the risks and benefits of these new and powerful drugs."

In addition to reducing the risk of physical and mental health problems, good sleep positively affects children's performance in school and other aspects of life. Children who get enough sleep are better able to focus, learn, and regulate their emotions. Unfortunately, over 30% of Canadian children do not meet the recommended sleep guidelines. Inadequate sleep can impact the entire family, with parents at risk of poorer health outcomes when their children struggle to sleep well. The COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated this issue, with disrupted sleep routines leading to shorter sleep duration and delayed bedtimes in children. In addition, disparities in sleep health exist, with children's sleep being influenced by factors such as socioeconomic status, race, community safety, and the environment. A collaborative, community-based approach is needed to support Canadian children to sleep well that considers factors at the individual, family, and neighbourhood levels. Partnerships among families, schools, community organizations, and healthcare professionals to promote healthy sleep can significantly improve health outcomes. By working together, communities can identify and address the factors that impact sleep health, ultimately supporting children's overall health and well-being."

However, little is known about whether this greater mental health burden also translates to greater use of mental health services within this population. Moreover, little is known about whether greater social support, which is generally associated with better mental health outcomes, may be associated with better mental health and reduced service use among 2SLGBTQI+ youth. Also, sex assigned at birth (males vs females) may also be associated with differences in mental health symptoms and service use. Thus, this study will compare 2SLGBTQI+ youth to their cisgender, heterosexual counterparts on mental health symptoms and mental health service use. We will then examine whether youth's perceptions of their social support network and sex differences may be associated with differences in mental health symptoms and service use. Data from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development will be used to explore 1) the prevalence of mental health symptoms within this cohort at age 23 years, and 2) the number of mental health-related outpatient and emergency visits from ages 14 to 23 years. We will then explore differences in these variables based on participants' perceptions of their social support network and their sex assigned at birth. This study will allow for a deeper understanding of the health care needs of these youth, and shed light on the potential utility of social support-related prevention and intervention strategies to reduce mental health symptoms among 2SLGBTQI+ youth."

In spite of this progress, the disabling complications of HIV have not been recognised nor the need for physical rehabilitation care for people living with HIV addressed by the healthcare system. To redress this, Handicap International, a non-governmental organisation working in Senegal, piloted a rehabilitation component within its HIV/Disability project in the region of Ziguinchor. It aimed at providing HIV prevention and treatment, including rehabilitation services, to people living with HIV who became disabled and HIV positive people with disabilities. The physical rehabilitation component focused on assessing the needs of service providers, medical officers, people with disabilities and people living with HIV on how patients' physical rehabilitation could be addressed; developing basic physical rehabilitation training tools; training local key health providers; and providing basic physical rehabilitation services by trained staff. This physical rehabilitation project component has proved to be relevant for strengthening the regional AIDS care management for people living with HIV, and addressing the rehabilitation needs of patients living with other chronic health conditions, such as stroke and diabetes. Also, it highlighted the importance of disability inclusion in service provision for quality improvement, monitoring and evaluation tools, and referral and back-referral mechanisms. To conclude, this project calls upon decision-makers and programme managers to take into consideration physical rehabilitation as a tool for healthcare system strengthening, and Global Health practitioners and researchers to be more attentive to rehabilitation services to reduce people's morbidity and increase their quality of life, beyond death."

Since the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020, the promotion of health equity and the health of marginalised or vulnerable groups have been hampered by both global health governance processes and decisions, and public health measures taken to control the pandemic. These have not only exacerbated underlying social and health inequities, but they have also led to massively redirecting financial, technical and human resources of existing research to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The research objective is to explore how the COVID-19 pandemic related global health governance is redefining population health research agendas in Canada from the perspectives of different actors. Global health governance refers to ""governance arrangements needed to further agreed global health goals"" such as health equity. We will conduct a multilevel analysis of the COVID-19 global health governance on population health research in Canada. Intersectionality, highlighting social, gender, and health inequities experienced by vulnerable populations, and the Kingdon Multiple-Streams Approach in agenda setting, will be used as conceptual and analytical frameworks. We will deploy various qualitative methods to triangulate information obtained from four levels of actors: researchers, research institutes and universities, research funders, and WHO. The study findings will enable us to better understand both the impacts of the pandemic related global health governance architecture on population health research agendas in Canada, and the potential unintended consequences on health equity and vulnerable populations. Research analyses will further help Canadian researchers and funders to improve accountability in terms of research intent, content, reach and outputs."

Due to multiple physical, attitudinal, environmental, and structural barriers, as well as discriminatory power dynamics, PWD face heightened intersectional inequities in exercising their rights to access education, livelihoods, and health services. Climate change threatens the integrity of health systems and the health of marginalised groups, such as PWD, through an increase in severe weather events and environmental upheavals. PWD may thus encounter additional challenges in accessing essential health services, such as sexual and reproductive health services, including HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, or psychosocial support, mental health, and rehabilitation services in Northern America. To identify inclusive climate- and health access-related research priorities and co-envision future projects, this proposal seeks funding for systematically reviewing the existing literature and engaging intersectoral actors, including women and men with different disabilities, intersectoral service providers, and decision-makers in Québec, Canada, and Gulu District in Northern Uganda. The outcomes of this grant will guide future scholarship for equity-focused health systems and global public health research agendas that include PWD in the context of climate change in both the Global South and North."
COVID-19 incidence rates among Canadian dentists as they return to work: a cohort study,"['Madathil, Sreenath A', 'Allison, Paul J', 'Siqueira, Walter L']","['Glogauer, Michael', 'Mcnally, Mary E', 'Quiñonez, Carlos R']","['Covid-19 Incidence Among Dentists', 'Risk Associated With Aerosol Generating Procedures']",295941.0,430045,"Since the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in Canada, in March 2020, dental regulatory authorities (DRAs) in provinces and territories across Canada obliged dentists to close their offices to routine care and provide emergency care only. The guidelines for dentists on the use of personal protective equipment or high-risk procedures (e.g., aerosol-generating procedures; AGPs), during the pandemic, vary between jurisdictions. Recently, some provinces have started allowing dentists to reopen their offices. However, guidelines on infection control, treatment and other procedures as dentists return to work have minimal evidence to support them. The overarching goal of this project is to estimate the incidence rate of COVID-19 among dentists and its risk associated with AGPs and N95 masks during the reopening phase of dental care services across jurisdictions in Canada. We are proposing a prospective cohort study of dentists during the reopening phase of dental services in Canada. An online questionnaire, adopted from WHO Unity Study protocols for assessment of COVID-19 risk among healthcare workers, will be used to collect information on socio-demographics, details of dental care provided to patients in the previous week, as well as symptoms related to COVID-19 and viral status (e.g., COVID-19 positive test). Saliva samples for detecting COVID-19 cases will also be collected at baseline and every four weeks. Participants will be followed on their viral status, clinical activities and COVID-19 status every two weeks post-baseline for a period of 12 months. Statistical analysis of the collected data will allow for the estimations of the incidence and prevalence of COVID-19 cases among Canadian dentists, and to identify the risk associated with AGPs and N95 masks. Our results will help the DRAs to monitor disease occurrence among dentists as they return to work and in developing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines and, as a result, prevent further spread of COVID-19."
Identifying workplace related chemical risk factors of prostate cancer: A Bayesian predictive approach,"['Madathil, Sreenath A']",['N/A'],"['Bayesian Inference', 'Measurement Error', 'Occupational Exposures', 'Prostate Cancer']",90000.0,396668,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most frequently occurring cancer among Canadian men. Each year more than 20,000 Canadian men are diagnosed with this cancer. Although these cancers have better prognosis compared to many other cancers, the diagnosis of PCa is followed with severe impairment in quality of life. Researcher have had little success in identifying modifiable risk factors of PCa. The only established risk factors are age, ancestry and a family history of prostate cancer. The geographical distribution of prostate cancer suggests an environmental influence in these diseases. Canadian men spent a considerable amount of their life time in or around workplaces and are exposed to different types of chemical and physical agents. Findings that exposure to some of these agents may alter hormone levels have sparked interest among researchers to investigate the prostate cancer risk associated with such chemicals. This research project aims at identifying which workplace chemical agents are important in increasing the risk of PCa, using a large database from the Quebec population -the Prostate Cancer & Environment Study (PROtEus). The PROtEus study assessed exposure to over 300 workplace chemical agents among 3931  participants, throughout their lifetime.  This comprehensive evaluation of exposures in PROtEus is superior to all other similar studies. Identifying which of the agents are important is a challenge. This project will used sophisticated, cutting-edge Bayesian statistical techniques to achieve this goal. The additional objective of the project is to statistically correct for any bias in estimation of risk of prostate cancer due to the error in exposure measurement. Overall, the project has two main contributions to public health; 1) advancing the knowledge by identifying the important modifiable workplace-related risk factors for PCa; 2) providing a novel methodological contribution by incorporating measurement error correction techniques using expert knowledge."
Feasibility of Measuring Equity of Access for Mental Health Care in a Primary Care Electronic Medical Record Database,"['Maddocks, Heather L']",['N/A'],['Feasibility Study On Equity Of Access To Mental Health Care'],1468.0,269113,"Primary healthcare (PHC) providers are often the first and only point of contact within the community to the broader healthcare system for many people with mental healthcare needs.  The prevalence of mental health problems in PHC remains high, and ongoing management of these problems often occurs without the involvement of a psychiatrist or mental health service provider.  

Electronic medical records (EMRs) used by PHC providers have the potential to provide a relatively rapid assessment of equity of access for mental health care and other services.  This research tests the feasibility of using a Southwestern Ontario EMR database to measure equity of access for mental health care.  

In this research, indicators of equity and inequity of access will be constructed.  Access to services will be identified through information in the EMR including number of patient visits, prescriptions for mental health diagnoses, and referrals to specialist providers.  Social structural advantages will be measured by linking the EMR data to other sources, including Ontario Health Insurance Plan data on the use of mental health services outside PHC.  

This project will develop knowledge on how to link datasets to improve measures of equity and access, including the Ontario Health Insurance Plan data on use of mental health care services outside PHC, and Canadian Census data on area level social structural advantages, including median household income and immigration status.

Understanding the challenges associated with using EMR data to measure equity of access to mental health care services will allow us to monitor strategies and interventions targeted at improving access and evaluate their effectiveness over time."
Premature mortality: closing the gap in Indigenous and non-Indigenous life expectancy,"['Maddox, Raglan']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal', 'Epidemiology', 'Indigenous', 'Indigenous Mortality', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Premature Mortality', 'Public Health', 'Tobacco Control']",2250.0,364661,"Background
Global life expectancy is approximately 70 years (2010), with Norheim et al. (2015) defining premature death as death before age 70 years. Indigenous people experience poorer health outcomes than their non-Indigenous counterparts, including experiencing a disproportionate burden of disease. A reduction of premature death could be an appropriate quantitative target to align with improving the health and wellbeing of Indigenous people. This presentation examines national death and the risk of death versus age by Indigenous status.
Methods
We analyse premature death data, and the risk of death versus age by Indigenous status. Risk of death is averaged over a 5-year period to smooth any sudden changes. For low-income, lowermiddle-income, upper-middle-income, and high-income countries as well as 1970 and 2010 risk of death versus age, we cite Norheim et al. (2015) and for death risk ratios regarding commercial tobacco use examining all-cause death, we cite Banks et al. (2015).
Results
Indigenous people experience disproportionately poor health outcomes in comparison to their non-Indigenous counterparts. The risk of premature death among Indigenous people is comparable to rates in middle-low income countries worldwide. Notably, smoking was one of the single major risk factors contributing to excess premature death.
Conclusion
Death rates have generally been falling, but there continues to be significant potential for change, especially in reducing Indigenous premature death and non-communicable disease death. One of the most important risk factor to address premature death is commercial tobacco use. Fortunately, quitting and preventing tobacco uptake works. If efforts to improve health and wellbeing are intensified, particularly working with Indigenous people, then it is possible to significantly reduce premature death. Reducing this premature death rate will be challenging, but achievable."
Understanding Indigenous tobacco control: informed by a realist-review,"['Maddox, Raglan']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal', 'Indigenous', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Realist Review', 'Tobacco Control']",2800.0,347099,"There are more than 300 million Indigenous people across 70 countries worldwide. Despite significant differences in the circumstances of Indigenous people globally, many themes and issues including persistent inequity in health are shared. The Indigenous experience of colonisation, marginalisation, family dislocation, racism, disconnection from land, loss of traditional diet and lifestyle, and the shift to Western habits and practices is central to patterns of poor health. One commonality among Indigenous populations is the disproportionate burden of non-traditional tobacco related morbidity and mortality when compared to their non-Indigenous counterparts. Furthermore, in many countries including Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United States of America (USA), the rate of tobacco use among the respective Indigenous peoples are significantly higher than their non-Indigenous counterparts. This research outlines the findings from a realist review to help understand Indigenous tobacco control.

This research examined 73 commercial tobacco control interventions in Indigenous communities globally, as well as theory testing in three Indigenous exemplar communities to explore what makes an Indigenous tobacco control program successful. Interventions incorporated numerous tobacco control activities to prevent (n=30), reduce (n=23) and/or cease (n=42) tobacco use; limit physical and social exposure (n=9); and limit access and availability to tobacco (n=2). Interventions were located in Indigenous communities in the USA, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Fiji, and Taiwan. A number of identified tobacco control mechanisms-the underlying processes that link program activities to specific program outcomes within the Indigenous context-assisted to lead to program success. This included examining and unpacking the evidence of Indigenous community investment-ownership-activation in Indigenous tobacco control."

Comparing Canadian children to other children in wealthy nations around the world, Canada ranks 24th out of 27 countries in terms of children's mental health. Children who have mental health difficulties can go on to become adults who also struggle with mental health. Past research has shown that many different risk factors in early childhood, like parent mental health problems, difficult child temperament, poor sleep, and excessive screen time, can lead to mental health difficulties in childhood, like anxiety, depression, aggression, and hyperactivity. What is less well known is which of these early risk factors are most important and how these risk factors combine to lead to children's mental health problems. Understanding which risk factors are most important will help doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers who work with families ask the right questions during regular appointments. Over the last 10 years, our team has been studying a group of over 3,000 mothers and their children who we have asked about early risk factors for children's mental health difficulties. We will link this data to the child's health record so that we can identify who has received a mental health diagnosis from a healthcare professional. Using the information we have collected from this large group of mothers and children, as well as information from the children's health record, this study will determine which early risk factors from the first 2 years of life are the best predictors of children's mental health difficulties at 8 years of age. We have brought together a team of experts in child development, children's mental health, and data analysis to help answer this question. This information will help guide clinicians to identify which children and families are in most need of intervention."

Unfortunately, stress, unpredictability, and disruptions can catalyze mental illness. Cross-sectional studies show that rates of anxiety and depression are on the rise during COVID-19, particularly in parents and youth. What is unknown is whether these rates will be maintained once COVID-19 disruptions have attenuated. In addition, there is no research showing how these increased rates correspond to health service utilization. High-quality, contemporary data on how parents and youth are independently and collectively coping with, and recovering from, the pandemic is crucial to inform the allocation of scarce mental health resources. Our study will provide this information. 

The All Our Families (AOF) study, a pregnancy cohort in Calgary that started in 2008 and has followed families over time, has surveyed mothers and youth (now aged 9-11 years) three times during the pandemic. We now seek to survey families in the recovery phase of COVID-19 in February of 2022 to examine the longitudinal trajectories and co-development of parent and youth depression and anxiety prior to, during, and in the aftermath of the pandemic. We aim to link cohort data to administrative mental health data to identify the patterns of diagnoses and health service utilization in the context of changing mental health symptoms. We aim to identify the patterns of risk and protective factors that have amplified and/or attenuated mental distress. 

This proposal provides an exceptional opportunity to identify who becomes most at risk based on both the structural determinants of health and personal/familial factors. Identification of the patterns of stability and change in mental health due to COVID-19, along with service utilization, can help inform decisions on resource allocation and prevention and intervention strategies to optimize mental health."

One in four are overweight or obese, mental health disorders have increased by 15% and 27% of preschool children are not developmentally ready to start school. These problems result in diminished health, wellbeing, educational achievement and lifetime success.Research across many disciplines has demonstrated that early interventions are badly needed to optimize physical, mental and educational outcomes. Yet there are major gaps in our understanding ofwho(which children),when(at which point in early life), andhow(what interventions) to intervene.To address these questions we created the largest primary care research network for children in Canada called The Applied Research Group for Kids -TARGet Kids!(www.targetkids.ca). TARGet Kids! has harnessed the power of Ontario’s publicly funded primary healthcare (PHC) system to collect data on 6000 children in the first 5 years of life, creating Canada’s largest early childhood longitudinal cohort. Over the past 5 yearsTARGet Kids!has received 18 grants totaling over $5 million, produced 20 high impact publications, brought global media attention to pressing child health issues and changed children’s primary healthcare (PHC) practice.We aim to leverage the success ofTARGet Kids!to optimize the health and development of Canada’s children by targeting the three outcomes of early life that have the greatest long-term impact on health and wellbeing: 1) Cardiometabolic health; 2) Mental health; and 3) School readiness. Our approach is driven by new data showing that these three outcomes share common early origins such that interventions aimed at one outcome will have positive effects on all three, thus markedly increasing the efficiency, feasibility and impact of this proposal. Using an integrated knowledge-to-action approach our objectives are:1) Expand theTARGet Kids!network in breadth, depth and diversity to follow the health and development of 12,000 Ontario children from pregnancy through the first 5 years of life, creating one of the largest and most comprehensive early childhood cohorts in the world.2) UseTARGet Kids!powerful longitudinal data to understand the trajectories to cardiometabolic health, mental health and school readiness to identify early modifiable factors as targets for PHC interventions.3) Develop state-of-the-art clinical risk prediction tools to arm Canada’s PHC providers with the ability to predict cardiometabolic health, mental health and school readiness outcomes early in life before negative outcomes develop to identify which children will maximally benefit from early interventions.4) LeverageTARGet Kids!practice based infrastructure to test, through cohort embedded randomized controlled trials (RCTs), promising PHC interventions to optimize the cardiometabolic health, mental health and school readiness of Canada’s children.Our novel trans-disciplinary plan capitalizes on the scientific expertise of a world class team with expertise in childhood cardiometabolic health, mental health, school readiness, health equity, economics, clinical trials, risk prediction modeling and knowledge translation. The breadth, depth and productivity of this program will place Canada at the forefront of early childhood prevention research. The payoff will be physically and mentally healthier children with optimal school performance resulting in lower health and social services expenditures and a healthier society."

The Canadian government recently announced the Canada-Wide Early Learning and Child Care (CWELCC) policy to support quality, affordable, available, and inclusive licensed childcare. While there is much excitement about this policy, it is unclear if the CWELCC will change licensed childcare access and how this may affect children's health and development. This study will involve families participating in the TARGet Kids! primary care research network in the Greater Toronto Area and Kingston, which has been collecting data on childcare use and the physical, mental, and developmental health of 12,000 children since 2008. Over the next 5 years, we will involve 932 children aged 1 - 4 years in the study and collect data on childcare use, growth, development, mental health, lifestyle behaviours, and socioeconomic status. We will evaluate how the CWELCC changed access to licensed childcare and how these changes are associated with child health and development compared to before the CWELCC. We will also examine how socioeconomic status may modify these associations. ENRICHED is well positioned to evaluate the impacts of the CWELCC policy in a large, multicultural, urban population on the physical, developmental, and mental health of children.

Although cancer is a leading cause of death for Canadians living with intellectual disabilities and developmental disabilities (IDD), they may be less likely to receive high quality cancer treatment compared to other Canadians. Because people living with IDD are more likely to live in vulnerable circumstances (such as those described above), this may impact how quickly their cancer is diagnosed, their access to life-saving treatment and result in worse outcomes.

The goal of this project is to determine whether or not Canadians living with IDD are more likely than Canadians who do not have IDD to be 1) diagnosed with cancer; 2) diagnosed with incurable cancer; 3) not receive the right cancer treatment; and 4) to die of their cancer. 

To achieve our goal, our team of cancer and IDD researchers and clinicians will perform simultaneous research studies of breast, colorectal, and cancer patients living in Manitoba and Ontario. This will be done by using data routinely collected during encounters with provincial health, social, and education systems. Analyses will be conducted within each respective province.

This study will provide the first Canadian research describing cancer outcomes for people with IDD. Without this information, people with IDD may not receive the best care for their cancer, causing unnecessary harm. This study will highlight ways to improve the quality of care provided. We will work with our policy partners to ensure this information is usable and informative to the care of underserved cancer populations."

Food environments have received growing research and policy interest, stemming from work on ‘obesogenic’ environments and their relationship to energy imbalance and poor dietary quality.Local food environments are also a health equity issue. Our team of Drs. Mah, Minaker, Cook, and Raine are a highly qualified multidisciplinary team at the cutting edge of population health intervention research in food environments in Canada, with a strong track record of independent and collaborative contributions in this area. We have research, policy, and practice expertise as well as critical ‘real-world’ experience in the specific type of KTA implementation work that the test jurisdictions will be doing. Our team will: 1) provide FRESH-IT training; 2) serve as key resources throughout implementation; 3) help establish the case for intervention including cooperating in brokering support of decision makers and diverse stakeholders; and 4) outline design alternatives for evaluating the proposed intervention. A local champion from the test jurisdiction will: 1) facilitate access to networks in the local context and co-broker stakeholder relationships; 2) synthesize local datasets and manage any new data collection and analysis; 3) co-lead, with our team, the coordination of local intervention design, suitable for decision-maker review.Through this project, we willincrease the intervention research capacityof local governments,advance the science of food environment measurementin Canada, andengage key local, provincial/territorial, and federal stakeholdersin KTA."

This study is based in methodological approaches from nutritional epidemiology but draws substantially from our expertise in spatial and social epidemiology, and health economics. It leverages Canada Research Chair-and national agency funded teams, with links internationally.

Several areas of nutrition research are converging on an important puzzle that will be addressed through the proposed study. Real-world price policies are highly effective in shaping consumer purchasing, but robust evidence of dietary improvement is still lacking. This suggests that although consumers are changing their purchasing in response to price changes (especially for price increases such as taxes), that they may not be necessarily making healthier substitutions, or altering the quality of what they eat, when they do so. 

Our team's extensive preliminary work with Nova Scotia Health, the provincial health authority, presents a distinctive opportunity to respond to this gap. We propose a prospective study of health worker diet in response to workplace food pricing, following a rigorous cohort-trial longitudinal design. We will examine the baseline link between workplace food purchasing and dietary adequacy, followed by a cohort-based pragmatic randomized controlled trial of a 20% price subsidy on healthier menu items in the workplace consumer food environment, and their effect on the nutritional quality of purchases and dietary intakes.

Our focus on price and affordability responds directly to NS Health evidence needs and internal stakeholder consultation; our approach draws from the emerging strong body of evidence at the intersection of studies on how affordability affects food purchasing, consumer food environments, and 'big data' approaches in assessing diet. This study builds on the tradition of worker cohort studies to support inferences about chronic disease risk across and within social groups. Our team is based on our expanded network of collaborators in pragmatic store trials, diet cost research, and added expertise in cohort-based dietary analyses and health economics."
Model-based impact evaluation of pre-exposure prophylaxis on HIV transmission among men who have sex with men in Montréal,"['Maheu-Giroux, Mathieu']","['Baril, Jean-Guy', 'Boily, Marie-Claude', 'Brisson, Marc', 'Cox, John J', 'Lambert, Gilles', 'Lebouché, Bertrand', 'Mercure, Sarah-Amélie', 'Mishra, Sharmistha', 'Otis, Joanne', 'Pronovost, Frédérick', 'Thomas, Réjean', 'Tremblay, Cécile L', 'Trottier, Benoit']","['Hiv/Aids', 'Impact Evaluation', 'Mathematical Modeling', 'Men Who Have Sex With Men', 'Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis']",355726.0,381358,"Over the last decade, the number of HIV diagnoses among men who have sex with men (MSM) has failed to decline in Québec despite the public health response. Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) - taking a daily antiretroviral pill - can prevent HIV acquisition among those who do not have HIV but are at risk of getting it. Studies suggest that PrEP could decrease an HIV acquisition risk by 86% among MSM and possibly by 100% among those adherent. In comparison, using a condom during anal sex reduces infection rates by 70%.

Starting in 2013, PrEP has been recommended by the Québec government and the province was the first to reimburse the drug using public funds. Preliminary data suggests that 15% of MSM in Montréal have used PrEP in 2016. Understanding the impact of PrEP on the HIV epidemic at the population level is important. Clinical studies only consider the individual benefits of PrEP and not the long-term population-level benefits of averting chains of transmission. Evaluating the population-level impact of Québec's PrEP program on HIV transmission is challenging as there is no appropriate comparison group. Further, PrEP could increase transmission of other sexually transmitted infections if it leads to lower condom use. Mathematical modeling - computer simulations of epidemics - can be used to tease-out the impact of PrEP. Specifically, we will:

1) Estimate the uptake of PrEP and characterize users' risk profile in Montréal.
2) Evaluate the population-level impact of PrEP interventions on HIV transmission.
3) Examine the reasons for PrEP interventions' success or failure in reducing HIV incidence.
4) Assess the impact of PrEP on gonorrhea incidence.

Québec is the only Canadian province where PrEP is an important component of the HIV response. By drawing on the expertise of our research team, this model-based impact evaluation provides a unique opportunity to optimize PrEP delivery and inform HIV prevention programs in Canada."
Elimination of cervical cancer through vaccination and screening in high HIV prevalence settings: a mathematical modeling and cost effectiveness study,"['Maheu-Giroux, Mathieu']","['Boily, Marie-Claude', 'Brisson, Marc', 'Chikandiwa, Admire', 'Delany-Moretlwe, Sinead', 'Kelly, Helen', 'Mayaud, Philippe', 'Pickles, Michael']","['Antiretroviral Therapy', 'Cervical Cancer', 'Cost-Effectiveness', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Mathematical Modeling', 'Optimization', 'Population Health', 'Screening', 'Vaccine']",478126.0,401978,"Cervical cancer is the number one cancer killing women in South Africa, a country at the epicenter of the HIV epidemic. Cervical cancer is caused by human papillomaviruses (HPV), which are vaccine-preventable infections. The World Health Organization has now set goals to eliminate cervical cancer. What might complicate elimination efforts in high HIV prevalence settings, however, is that people living with HIV are more susceptible to HPV and vice versa. These biological interactions affect the transmission dynamics of both viruses with important public health implications. 

When used at sufficient coverage, vaccines are powerful prevention tools because they protect those immunized and the wider population by limiting HPV spread and, eventually, cervical cancer. South Africa's HPV vaccination program currently only immunizes 4th grade schoolgirls. Though South Africa wishes to improve the program, they lack the necessary evidence and policy guidance about the benefits of different vaccination and screening strategies in a context of high HIV prevalence. Our overall objective is to fill this knowledge gap by investigating how to achieve cervical cancer elimination through HPV vaccination and cervical cancer screening in South Africa.

Our proposed study combines state-of-the-art data and computer simulations of HIV/HPV transmission, to identify vaccination and screening strategies that can lead to cervical cancer elimination in South Africa (who to vaccinate? with which vaccine? how many doses?). We will also identify the strategies that would lead to faster cervical cancer elimination, determine which ones are most cost-effective, and investigate the specific impact of HIV transmission on elimination efforts. By drawing on the expertise of a multidisciplinary team of researchers in epidemiology, economics, and mathematical modeling, our results will help mitigate the double threat of HIV and HPV to one of sub-Saharan Africa's most vulnerable groups, women."
Optimizing HIV testing services in sub-Saharan Africa to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030,"['Maheu-Giroux, Mathieu']","['Eaton, Jeffrey W', 'Johnson, Leigh F', 'Panagiotoglou, Dimitra', 'Schmidt, Alexandra']","['Bayesian Statistics', 'Cost-Effectiveness Analyses', 'Diagnostics', 'Elimination', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Key Populations', 'Mathematical Modeling', 'Optimization', 'Sub-Saharan Africa']",531676.0,420347,"Ending the AIDS epidemic begins by building efficient HIV testing services. HIV testing has, and remains, a cornerstone of HIV prevention efforts. A positive diagnosis entails that people living with HIV can receive life-saving antiretroviral therapy and, if the test is negative, people vulnerable to HIV acquisition can be identified and linked to prevention services. 

The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) put forward the objective of ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030 by strengthening the HIV care cascade. The proportion of people living with HIV aware of their status is a key progress indicator and common bottleneck in the cascade. Tracking this indicator in sub-Saharan Africa is difficult, however, as surveillance systems are often incomplete. Our team has recently developed tailored tools that specifically address these challenges. Yet, current models are agnostic about testing modalities (e.g., opt-in, HIV self-tests, mobile campaigns) and cannot stratify coverage metrics by key populations (e.g., female sex workers and men who have sex with men). Members of these populations represent close to 50% of global new HIV infections and, if the goal of ending AIDS is to be achieved, they need explicit consideration. 

To fill these knowledge gaps, we will develop methods, build tools, and validate models to inform, strengthen, and optimize HIV testing services. Specifically, we will 1) improve estimates by integrating new data sources, 2) adapt current frameworks to consider key populations, and 3) optimize national HIV testing strategies considering affordability and cost-effectiveness. By drawing on the expertise of an international team of HIV researchers, biostatisticians, economists, modelers, and knowledge users, our project will guide global recommendations on how best to sustainably close gaps in diagnosis coverage among some of sub-Saharan Africa's most vulnerable groups."
"Social vulnerability, health outcomes and the use of healthcare resources among community dwelling older adults living in Nova Scotia with dementia","['Mah, Jasmine C']",['N/A'],"['Frailty', 'Neurocognitive Disorders', 'Orphan Patients', 'Social Determinants Of Health', 'Social Vulnerability']",,460538,"We know that an individual's health conditions (aka ""frailty"") can independently determine health outcomes and utilization of health resources in patients with dementia. However, you can also predict an individual's health by looking at their social determinants of health. For example, people who are lonely or socially isolated, who have lower educational attainment or who have poorer socioeconomic status have worse health outcomes than those who are in those ways more fortunate. The term is called ""social vulnerability"". Social vulnerability is particularly relevant in the elderly population with cognitive impairment, who experience shrinking support groups, poorer health preventing social participation, and an ever- increasing need to rely on the health system.

Social vulnerability is not only an important risk factor that contributes to poor health, but it can also have great practical relevance when organizing care services for patients and caregivers living with dementia. How best to understand the social factors that contribute to the health of individuals and groups can present a challenge for researchers and clinicians because social circumstances are complex and do not fit well within traditional medical models of disease-specific silos of care. There is a great need to better understand and measure how social circumstances relate to health and frailty, and how they contribute to vulnerability in outpatient settings. This is the heart of the issue that we propose to address. First, this project will address how social vulnerability influences the health outcomes (e.g. mortality, functional decline, hospitalization) of older adults living in the community with dementia. Second, this project will examine how social vulnerability influences use of home care resources and services. Finally, this study will comment on the societal implications and policy relevance of social vulnerability for community dwelling older adults with dementia."

COVID-19 and pandemic response measures implemented to limit its spread have resulted in various indirect health impacts due to the disruption of many preventative, diagnostic, and management services. The extent of their impacts on the diabetes care cascade are not known. South Asians, representing 25% of the visible minorities have highest burden of type 2 diabetes. Higher incidence of COVID-19 was reported in neighborhood areas with higher density of South Asian population in British Columbia (BC) and Ontario. However, it is not known if diabetes care cascade among South Asians was impacted more than other population groups. 
 Aims
 We aim to assess: a) The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the diabetes care cascade, b) Differential impact in South Asians vs other population groups; c) Patient/provider perceptions of disruption of services.
Approach 
We will use BC COVID-19 Cohort which integrates daily COVID-19 lab tests, case follow-up data, COVID-19 immunizations, hospital and ICU admissions, with demographic, healthcare utilization datasets (medical visits, hospital admissions, emergency room visits, dispensed prescription drugs) Chronic Disease Registry and socioeconomic data and data from BC SPEAK Survey. We will construct care cascade in pre-pandemic years and pandemic/post pandemic years and apply a combination of epidemiological and statistical techniques to investigate the stated aims. We will gather qualitative data based on interviews with diabetes patients and care providers to provide context and inform interventions to prevent further disruptions and optimize care 
Outcomes: 
This project will characterize the extent of disruption in services across diabetes care cascade and will identify characteristics of population most affected. We will provide evidence on disparities experienced by South Asians and identify strategies to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or future similar health emergencies for individuals with diabetes."
Use of statins and prostate cancer risk and prognosis: A population-based study,"['Mahmud, Salaheddin']","['Aprikian, Armen G', 'Franco, Eduardo L', 'Platt, Robert W', 'Singh, Harminder', 'Skarsgard, David', 'Tonita, Jon M']","['Cancer Aetiology', 'Cancer Epidemiology', 'Cancer Prognosis', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Prostate Cancer', 'Statins']",148228.0,224654,"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, accounting for approximately 25,800 new cases each year in Canada. Treatment often does not result in a cure, so preventive measures are urgently needed. Unfortunately, very little is known about the causes of prostate cancer and on how to prevent its occurrence. Statins, a group of pharmaceuticals that includes atorvastatin (Lipitor) and rosuvastatin (Crestor), are widely used in the treatment of high cholesterol levels. Statins, which already appear to protect against heart disease and stroke, may also protect against cancer. Laboratory studies have shown that these drugs can inhibit the growth of human prostate cancer cells, but there is not yet enough corroborating evidence from human studies to be sure, and, therefore, more research on this topic is needed. 

The first aim of this proposal is to determine whether using statins can protect against prostate cancer. We will do this by contrasting the frequency of consumption of these drugs among prostate cancer patients to that of a comparable group of healthy men. The information will come from the Prescription Drug Plan database maintained by the health department of Saskatchewan, a Canadian province with universal health insurance coverage and excellent records of health care utilization. Our second aim is to investigate the role of statins in treating prostate cancer using data from the same source.

Statins are widely used for the prevention of coronary heart disease. They are generally safe and can be taken over the long term. If we find that statin use is associated with reduced risk of developing prostate cancer, this may have important public health and clinical implications for the prevention of this common and fatal disease. The information gained from this study may also improve our understanding of the sequence of events that leads to the development of prostate cancer."

""Seasonal"" flu vaccines remain the mainstay of flu control, but their field effectiveness, especially among the sick and elderly who need them the most, is questionable. Newer expensive vaccines with limited data have mushroomed raising the cost and complexity of vaccine programs. Flu vaccine effectiveness (VE) is influenced by vaccine potency and uptake; viral strain, infectivity and virulence and by host characteristics; factors that often vary by season, product and population. 

Progress towards developing better vaccines has been hampered by dogma, and over-reliance on poorly validated immune correlates, paucity of clinical trials due to ethical/practical constraints and fragmentary reductionist approaches to post-licensure evaluation. Flu VE cannot be understood using one-off studies limited to specific seasons, populations and outcomes, and interpreted in isolation of viral and host characteristics. Our challenge is to design effective & sustainable strategies of continually and comprehensively evaluating conventional and novel flu vaccines and understanding their complex interactions with viral, host & environmental factors. 

I envision a safe and effective societal response to both seasonal epidemics and& pandemics. To this end, I propose to further develop our rapid analytics platform built on a continually updated comprehensive data warehouse and use it to address knowledge gaps, guide decision-making and develop new vaccine research methods. This research program will create methods and tools to create data warehouses and automate rapid analysis of their data which can be shared with other provinces and to develop an integrated rich data to facilitate research and quality improvement initiatives. The program will also provide excellent opportunities for training new researchers & knowledge users."

Examining how factors such as ambient environments, social connections, and access to amenities and services relate to well-being will help us understand the importance of neighbourhoods on population-wide subjective well-being. This program involves creating measures for well-being and quality of life across neighbourhoods. These measures will help governments budget and make decisions that support the well-being and resilience of Canadians. Linked data at Statistics Canada will also allow us to explore the relationship between neighbourhood measures of well-being and health outcomes such as hospital visits and premature death.

The substantial burden of cardiovascular diseases promotes enduring interest in new ways of screening for early disease diagnosis and prediction. Fundus retinal imaging is a non-invasive and cost-effective procedure. Since the ophthalmic medium is translucent, it allows retinal vessels to be viewed with relative ease. Some retinal parameters, including vascular diameter, tortuosity, and branching, have been shown to be potentially associated with cardiovascular diseases. The findings suggest that the retinal microvasculature could provide essential data about concurrent cardiovascular disease status and predict future incidence of cardiovascular disease. However, previous studies have some limitations: (1) most studies focused on patients with a certain disease (e.g. diabetes) rather than a general population; (2) not all known confounders, such as obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and other retinal parameters, were adjusted for when assessing whether a retinal parameter was associated with cardiovascular diseases; (3) no age- and sex-stratified investigation has been done though the association between retinal parameters and cardiovascular diseases is believed to be different for men and women and for midlife and elderly population. To address these limitations in the current literature, the objectives of our study are: (1) to identify age- and sex-specific retinal parameters that are independently associated with cardiovascular diseases, using the data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA); (2) to develop cardiovascular disease risk scores based on retinal parameters and other biological and lifestyle measures to detect concurrent and predict future incident cardiovascular diseases, respectively.

This study aims to clarify the extent of involvement in leisure activities, known to be critical in promoting health and minimizing risk for cardiovascular and psychosocial sequelae. In particular, this study will identify the facilitators and obstacles to a physically and socially active and satisfying life for these two target groups of survivors of early intensive care. The child, family and environmental attributes that are associated with participation in active physical and other leisure activities will be determined. Involvement and enjoyment of leisure activities is critical for developing life skills, promoting healthy and fit lifestyles, fostering friendships, increasing self-worth and personal autonomy. Of note, a sedentary lifestyle is detrimental to the cardiovascular health of all children, and health risk is likely to be compounded by any chronic illness or disability. Recognition of the factors that influence leisure participation is essential to guide the development of targeted adaptive and remediation strategies and health promotion initiatives that foster health and well-being."

Currently, a major threat to our resilience in the face of infectious diseases is their resistance to the antibiotics used to treat them.  Thus, it is critical that we understand how resilience helps us respond to this emerging threat of antibiotic resistance.  We will assess two key types of infections for which resistance is a growing issue, and determine how best to respond to the threat of antibiotic resistance within our current social, political, biological, and economic systems.

This project will harness the rich genotypic, imaging and phenotypic data from nearly 12,000 children recruited for the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study and findings from multiple genome-wide association studies to build a multivariate model of polygenic risk for schizophrenia, bipolar, major depressive, anxiety, and eating disorders. I aim to capture the unique and shared contributions of psychiatric polygenic risk in one score using cutting-edge genomic data science methods. This score will then be related to measures of white matter in the brain that can be assessed non-invasively with magnetic resonance imaging. I will then integrate findings of microstructural features most related to polygenic risk for psychiatric disorders to maladaptive behaviours in childhood that could be predictive of the onset of future psychiatric symptoms. This project will provide an important neurobiological framework to assess psychiatric risk in early life that represents a significant departure from the classical definitions of psychiatric disorders, with the hope of re-routing current treatment plans to better meet the needs of patients and their families."
Modeling changes in cervical cancer screening performance in the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine era and the determinants of HPV transmission,"['Malagon, Talia C']",['N/A'],"['Cervical Cancer', 'Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Epidemiology', 'Hpv Vaccination', 'Human Papillomavirus', 'Infection Risk Factors', 'Mathematical Modelling', 'Transmission']",135000.0,338716,"Cytological screening is highly effective at preventing cervical cancer. However, the value of screening is less certain for the increasing number of women vaccinated against the human papillomavirus (HPV). A lower prevalence of carcinogenic HPV will reduce the performance of screening, with more false positives and overtreatment. Changes in screening practices are being considered to retain the preventive benefits while minimizing negative health outcomes. Using dynamic mathematical modelling, I will first simulate changes in screening performance, and assess the benefits of different protocol changes which may be considered such as increasing age at screening initiation, extending screening intervals, or targeting women at higher risk of cervical cancer. Dynamic models are the most rigorous method of evaluating uncertainty around potential long-term benefits and harms of health interventions. The results will be highly valuable for policy-makers seeking to provide evidence-based recommendations for cervical screening.

Individuals with multiple HPV infections are at higher risk of developing cervical precancer. Sexual behaviour, acquired immunity, and genetic predisposition contribute to individuals' infection risk, but it is difficult in epidemiological studies to determine the relative importance of each factor due to measurement error and confounding. My second objective is to develop dynamic models of HPV transmission calibrated to data from a biobank of over 40,000 biological samples collected in epidemiological studies (HITCH, McGill-Concordia, Ludwig-McGill, CCCaST) to evaluate the relative importance of sexual behaviour and acquired immunity for HPV transmission, and analyze whether epidemiological observations are consistent with our understanding of HPV natural history. This research will identify the most important determinants of infection, which will help understand inter-individual variation in the efficacy of HPV vaccination and screening."

We are interested in studying the vaginal and penile microbiomes, how they influence each other in sexual partners, and how they may influence acquisition and clearance of infections with human papillomaviruses (HPV). In particular, we are interested in the role that bacteria which cause bacterial vaginosis in women play in the risk of HPV infection in men and women.

This research will use next generation sequencing methods to test vaginal and penile samples from heterosexual partners of the HITCH cohort study, in order to characterize which bacteria are present in the vaginal and penile microbiomes of study participants. We will assess how the microbiome composition changes over time in both partners to see if there is evidence of interactions between the penile and vaginal microbiomes of sex partners, and if there are penile bacteria which increase the risk of bacterial vaginosis in a sex partner. We will then look at whether there are specific bacteria or other features of the microbiome which are linked to HPV transmission between partners, and clearance of HPV infection by the immune system.

We expect this research to lead to novel biological insights into how vaginal and penile microbiomes interact to affect the risk of HPV in sex partners. This research could help identify novel interventions for treating and manipulating the vaginal or penile microbiome to reduce the risk of acquiring HPV, help clear HPV infections, and prevent recurrence of bacterial vaginosis."

Current health promotion strategies for women experiencing GBV (e.g., counselling, pain management), while valuable, have been criticized for their limited attention to evidence-informed population-level interventions that benefit both physical and mental health. It is well documented for instance that physical activity (PA) can decrease premature death and suffering associated with chronic diseases and can improve depression- and anxiety-related symptoms. To date, however, minimal work has explored the role of PA in improving the health and well-being of women experiencing GBV. Crucially, while any increase in PA levels would likely benefit women experiencing GBV, it has been shown that individuals experiencing marginalization are less likely to engage in standard PA programs. In acknowledgment of this problem, the World Health Organization published a report providing guidelines for PA promotion in marginalized communities, highlighting the need for consultation with these communities and for the design of multidisciplinary and intersectional interventions, which prioritize social inclusion and connectedness and work to improve access to opportunities for PA. Using a mixed-methods design, I will collaboratively engage with women experiencing GBV to develop a 12-week, group-based PA program in the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver, British Columbia and explore its feasibility, assess its acceptability to participants and providers, and evaluate preliminary data on key mental and physical health outcomes. This research will contribute to our understanding of health programming for individuals from marginalized communities and provide insight surrounding the feasibility, and therefore real-world application, of an innovative equity-oriented PA program."

We will use this remarkable and unique Canadian resource to perform studies that examine the population burden of Canada's dietary patterns and food consumption. We will develop the world's most robust planning models for food. Canadian planners will be able to, for the first time, assess different policy scenarios and potential changes to our food supply to gauge the potential to improve health and reduce health inequities.

Our tools will provide a report on how close patients are to death (a range, predicted based on previous observations), and will provide a link to resources (e.g., advance care planning tools and available community supports) that will help their journey. Following our pilot, we will conduct focus groups to determine how we can make the tools more useful and acceptable. We will then modify our tools, and prepare for a larger roll-out in the Windsor-Essex County population that has formed a multi-sectorial coalition that aims to improve the care of those who are frail and nearing the end-of-life.

The study will also calculate the impact of unhealthy dietary patterns on chronic diseases (cardiovascular diseases), death and healthcare use. The health and healthcare benefits of strategies to improve dietary patterns will also be examined. Culturally-relevant dietary patterns will be ""reverse engineered"" to examine how to reduce health and healthcare burden and inequalities among Canadians. This study will use the nutrition focused Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) 2004, and the forthcoming 2015 cycle. The CCHS 2004 is unique worldwide; it is the largest population-based dietary survey linked to health and health care outcomes. These data allow very detailed assessment of health and social outcomes. Robust population health policy models will be created to support evidence-based nutrition policy for reducing the burden of poor dietary patterns. Policy actors will be involved in model development to ensure that models address questions of real-world policy relevance. Health calculators (risk-assessment tools) will be created from the policy models. These calculators can be used by individual Canadians and their clinicians to increase awareness of health risks from poor dietary patterns. This project will provide the first evidence on dietary patterns and health and healthcare outcomes at the national population level, an essential component for development of nutritional guidelines and policies. The models and supporting data linkages will create a lasting infrastructure and will position Canada as a world leader in population health assessment of nutrition policy."

Both have the potential to help make sure that the right decisions and supports are in place to improve the quality of end-of-life of all Canadians. With this grant, our team of patients, researchers and health professionals will combine, validate and enhance these algorithms to form RESPECT Now!. We will test and validate it with New Zealand collaborators. We will make sure that health professionals, patients and families are supported when discussing personalized life expectancy by integrating RESPECT Now! into patient decision aids to identify decision-making needs, plan next steps of care, and share preferences.

In December 2015, the Government of Ontario began relaxing rules regarding the sale of alcohol by allowing select grocery stores to sell beer, wine, and cider. This policy decision resulted in 450 more stores selling alcohol in Ontario over 5 years (an increase in alcohol stores by 30%). Previous studies have found that individuals in regions with more alcohol stores drink more alcohol and experience greater alcohol-related harms. However, we don't fully understand the direction of this relationship (e.g., do more stores promote higher alcohol consumption or does heavier alcohol consumption attract more stores?). Further, no study has examined if the relationship between more alcohol stores and health outcomes differs for specific populations such as between men and women and younger and older adults. In this study, we will determine how adding alcohol sales in grocery stores impacted the health of Ontarians. We will link detailed data on Ontario's alcohol retail landscape over 8 years to Ontario's health records which capture health care visits due to alcohol (emergency department, hospitalizations, primary care). The sequential roll-out of grocery store alcohol sales allows us to observe the effect of this experiment at multiple time points, reducing the likelihood that any observed impacts are due to chance. Also, since not all grocery stores began selling alcohol, we can compare changes in health outcomes for individuals living close to grocery stores that began selling alcohol to those living close to grocery stores that did not sell alcohol. Our research fills a critical knowledge gap concerning alcohol policies in Canada and internationally.

Cognitive impairment refers to a state between normal cognition and dementia and is characterized by problems with memory, language, thinking or judgement. Though some cognitive decline is associated with normal aging, those with cognitive impairment are at increased risk of developing dementia. People with cognitive impairment are also more likely to be hospitalized, have more difficulty performing daily tasks, and often have a reduced quality of life and poor well-being compared to those their age with normal cognition. There are currently no treatments to reverse cognitive decline or cure dementia, however there are known ways to reduce your risk of further decline and dementia development. These include engaging in regular physical activity, not smoking, and managing health conditions including diabetes and hypertension. Other ways of potentially preventing cognitive decline that require further exploration include use of hearing aids for those with hearing loss, maintenance of dental and oral health, and consistently getting a good night sleep. 
In this project we will explore at how modifiable risk factors (including physical activity, diet, smoking, hearing impairment, sleep, oral health, traumatic brain injury, and air pollution) influence the risk of developing cognitive impairment. We will then use this information to develop a risk prediction tool that can be used by policy makers to estimate the burden of cognitive decline in the Canadian population and evaluate risk reduction strategies."

However, there was no other country out of the 12 in the study (including Canada) that was comparable to Kenya. In addition, none of the sites had data from a rural sub-sample which may also have different characteristics. Relying on results from only urban and peri-urban populations of mostly medium-to-high income countries for making global policy decisions or for intervention strategies may be misleading and inappropriate. The project being proposed will help address this problem by collecting data among school-children from Zimbabwe (a low-income country comparable to Kenya), using a similar protocol as done before but adding a rural sub-sample and some additional measures. The project will fill an important and country-specific gap in research data on prevalence estimates of childhood obesity and its relationship with lifestyle and environmental factors. The data will also enable international comparisons of these relationships, and provide evidence of similarities or differences which are important for structuring accurate public health messages and intervention strategies that are informed by relevant research evidence. Furthermore, comparing children across cultures and regions will help researchers and policy makers borrow ideas that are applicable to all country contexts but also develop separate ones where needed. Accurate estimates of the magnitude of childhood obesity and how it relates to other factors is very important in the efforts to reduce or prevent non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular and other chronic diseases, while elevating awareness of the importance of a healthy lifestyle during childhood."

There is also a general lack of surveillance information, especially in countries, with limited resources about movement behaviors and how they relate to healthy child growth and development. As part of an international research effort, I am proposing a project that will help to address this problem.

Mental health problems related to psychological distress, depression, and burnout have assumed major proportions among the workforce. Epidemiological studies suggest that more women than men are affected by these problems. The research literature, however, offers no definitive explanation for these male-female divergences. Objectives. This research project will attempt (1) to explain how differences between men and women arise when the work-family interface functions as mental health determinant, and (2) to examine the impact of organizational context, particularly policies intended to balance work-family responsibilities. This research project proposes to analyze (1) how of male-female differences associated with work and family affect mental health; (2) how men and women experience stressors in the workplace and the family; (3) how gender-related specificities characterize the overall stress process, particularly those arising from the work-family balance; (4) how psychological distress, depression, and burnout associated with the overall stress process vary between men and women; and (5) what effects company policies designed to facilitate balancing work-family responsibilities have on mental health by gender. Methodology. Data from the SALVEO study conducted by the Research Team on Work and Mental Health (RTWMH) were derived from a sample of 2162 workers (49% women) employed by 63 Québec companies. The application of multilevel regression models and multilevel models of causal paths will allow evaluating male-female differences. Outcomes. The results anticipated from the proposed study will shed light on the social etiology of mental health problems among men and women and will eventually make it possible to devise company policies that take specific needs and circumstances into account."
Perceptions of innovative orally administered treatment for long-term opioid dependent participants in the SALOME clinical trial,"['Marchand, Kirsten I']",['N/A'],"['Data Triangulation', 'Health Services Research', 'Opioid Dependence', 'Opioid Substitution Treatment', 'Qualitative Research Methods', 'Treatment Perceptions']",17500.0,280115,"Opioid dependence (i.e., heroin dependence) is a chronic illness that poses great harm to the individual, their family and the wider community. Substitution with oral methadone is the gold standard treatment for opioid dependence, but is not effective for 15 to 25% of chronic opioid dependent individuals. SALOME (Study to Assess Longer-Term Opioid Medication Effectiveness; CIHR-funded) is a randomized, double blind clinical trial testing the effectiveness of hydromorphone (a licensed pain medication; [HDM]) and diacetylmorphine (active ingredient in heroin; [DAM]) as alternative treatments for this population.  In Stage I of SALOME, participants are treated with injectable HDM or DAM and in Stage II, half of the participants switch to an oral formulation of HDM or DAM treatment.  Despite its effectiveness, treatment with an injectable medication poses some challenges for the health care system (e.g., clinic logistics) and society (e.g., stigma). Thus, the oral treatments in SALOME, if proven effective, have the potential to significantly expand available treatment options for a population that has not benefited from available treatments in Canada. 

SALOME does not collect data about the delivery of the oral treatment; information that is critical to consider in the planning of future health delivery systems. Therefore, the proposed study is dedicated to analyzing participant's perceptions of oral treatment in SALOME and determining the association between participant's treatment satisfaction with street opioid use at 12 months. Using a mixed qualitative (in-depth interviews) and quantitative (i.e., urinalysis reports, client satisfaction questionnaire) methods approach, data will be triangulated to enrich the theoretical framework being developed.  The proposed study will identify the perceptions and outcomes of an innovative treatment alternative for a population that remains outside of the Canadian health care system."
Beyond informed consent: ethical dilemmas in a clinical trial testing the effectiveness of injectable opioid assisted treatment for long-term opioid dependence,"['Marchand, Kirsten I']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,364579,"Opioid dependence (i.e., heroin) is a chronic illness that poses harms to the individual, their family and the wider community. Oral methadone is the most widely used treatment for opioid dependence. For patients who do not respond to this and other existing treatments, a recent Canadian clinical trial has shown that medically supervised injectable diacetylmorphine (active ingredient in heroin) and hydromorphone (a licensed pain medication) are both safe and effective. Despite the benefit these treatments offer, there continues to be debate regarding whether patients with long-term opioid dependence are able to voluntarily consent to such research. 

This debate will be discussed at the Canadian Public Health Association Conference and will reference the recent Canadian clinical trial. The central ethical issue identified is beyond whether people with opioid dependence are able to voluntarily consent to injectable diacetylmorphine and hydromorphone treatment. Instead, the dilemma is rooted in the fact that people with opioid dependence may only be able to gain access to such life-saving treatments through their participation in clinical research. This debate therefore has implications for public health researchers studying new and innovative treatments outside the addictions research field. In such research, ethical solutions that address this underlying problem, while not limiting the possibility of research altogether, are needed. This debate and the lessons learned from this clinical trial will be shared with researchers, clinicians, decision makers and advocacy groups."
Patient perceptions of the effectiveness of oral hydromorphone for long-term opioid dependence,"['Marchand, Kirsten I']",['N/A'],"['Addiction Treatment', 'Health Services Research', 'Opioid Dependence', 'Patient Centered Care', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Quantitative Methods']",105000.0,365463,"Opioid dependence (e.g., heroin) is a chronic illness that poses harms to the individual, their family and the wider community. Oral methadone is the most widely used treatment for opioid dependence. For patients continuing to inject street opioids, evidence suggests that injectable diacetylmorphine (active ingredient in heroin; [DAM]) is an effective alternative. Access to DAM poses regulatory and logistical challenges in Canada and worldwide; thus, there is a need for alternative medications that could attract and retain long-term street opioid injectors not benefitting from conventional treatments. 

For such contexts, SALOME (Study to Assess Long-term Opioid Medication Effectiveness) tested if hydromorphone (a licensed pain medication; [HDM]) could be an alternative to DAM in a two-stage, randomized, double-blind clinical trial. In Stage I, participants with long-term opioid dependence were randomized to either injectable HDM or DAM. In Stage II half of the participants randomly switched to the oral route of their Stage I medication to test if the oral formulation is as effective as the injectable. 

Stage II of SALOME was stopped prematurely because of evidence that oral was not as effective as injectable. Despite this, some participants were retained to oral medications and stopped using street opioids. Moreover, some have continued on oral medications since the end of the trial. To determine the effectiveness of these alternative oral medications, this study will analyze the relationship between participant's characteristics and oral treatment access. This study will also meet with a sub-group of participants to collect their perceptions of the effectiveness of oral treatments. This evidence is essential to understand the effectiveness of alternative oral treatments, an approach that could be beneficial for those willing to stop injecting street opioids and not reached by conventional opioid-dependence treatment."

Ce projet de recherche vise à développer un programme innovant pour rendre leur résidence plus favorable à leur autonomie. Une approche de recherche-action participative sera utilisée, ce qui fait en sorte que des personnes ayant un TSA, des parents et des intervenant(e)s seront impliqués à toutes les étapes du projet. Cela permettra de développer un programme rigoureux sur le plan scientifique, applicable en contexte réel et répondant adéquatement aux besoins des personnes concernées. Cependant, la participation de personnes ayant un TSA à des projets de recherche représente un défi étant donné leurs difficultés de communication et d'interactions sociales.

The Role of Behavioural and Environmental Risk Factors in Cancer Sex Ratios in the Canadian Population,"['Marozoff, Shelby']",['N/A'],"['Administrative Data', 'Behavioural Risk Factors', 'Cancer', 'Environmental Risk Factors', 'Primary Prevention', 'Sex Disparities']",105000.0,477547,"In Canada, about 44% of men and 43% of women will develop cancer in their lifetime and it is the leading cause of death. For cancers that affect both sexes (i.e., not cancers such as ovarian or prostate, among others), men are diagnosed more than women for most cancers. The reasons for this difference are mostly unknown, but one recent study found that factors already linked to cancer such as BMI, diabetes, and smoking only explained a modest part of the male predominance in most cancers. But, to the best of my knowledge, many behavioural and environmental factors were not examined to see how much they could explain this male predominance in cancer diagnoses. 

The aims of my study are to: 1) describe male vs. female sex ratios for new cancer cases in the Canadian population and 2) see if the apparent sex ratio in these cancers is explained by sex differences in known risk factors.

To do this study, I will use data from three linked sources: 1) the largest cohort in Canada, which includes more than 300,000 adult participants from eight provinces who have been filling out health questionnaires since 2008/2009; 2) Canadian environmental monitoring data; and 3) provincial cancer datasets, which include data on all individuals in a province diagnosed with and/or receiving treatment for cancer. From these three datasets, the following risk factors will be examined: age, sex, gender, ethnicity, marital status, family cancer history, BMI, physical activity, tobacco use, alcohol use, diet, UV exposure, income, education, other illnesses, neighbourhood relative wealth, and air quality. I will answer my study aims by calculating cancer sex ratios for 19 different physical sites in the body (e.g., lung, colorectal). Separate analyses will be done for transgender men and women. The results of this project will give important information on the different processes whereby men and women develop cancer, which may be used to develop sex-specific guidelines for cancer prevention."
Renewing national consensus on sun safety messages for Canada,"['Marrett, Loraine D', 'Atkinson, John', 'Nuttall, Robert K', 'Rosen, Cheryl F']","['Chu, Maria', 'Hodgson, Corinne S']","['Common Messages', 'National Consensus', 'Personal Protection', 'Skin Cancer Prevention', 'Sun Protection']",10000.0,308188,"Between 1996 and 2006, Canadians generally increased their time in the sun without improving protection. During this period, the incidence rates of melanoma, the most fatal form of skin cancer, have been increasing in Canada and are projected to continue to rise. Skin cancer is largely preventable through reducing ultraviolet radiation exposure; thus, public education through consistent messaging is an essential part of a prevention strategy. National consensus on messages was last achieved in Canada in 1994 and an update to reflect the current science and to address gaps is required.

The Ontario Sun Safety Working Group (OSSWG) plans to partner with the Canadian Cancer Society (CCS), and the Canadian Dermatology Association (CDA) to organize a workshop to gain national consensus on updated sun safety messages for clearer and more consistent public education in Canada. The OSSWG has identified gaps in current public education messaging, conducted a review of the evidence in consultation with an expert committee, drafted a revised messages and evidence document, and has carried out focus testing of this document as a foundation for work among public health professionals. Organizing a consensus workshop provides a unique opportunity for the next phase of work.

Renewed consensus will help ensure that organizations across the country that are addressing sun awareness and skin cancer prevention will communicate a consistent set of messages to Canadians concerning the activities required to protect themselves during sun exposure, thereby reducing the risk of skin cancer. Consistent messages will reduce uncertainty around what protective actions to take and therefore increase the likelihood of the adoption of these behaviours."

Our overarching goal is to advance the FNHA vision of healthy, self-determining and vibrant First Nations children, families and communities. We will also partner to train five Indigenous graduate students (four MSc and one PhD) who will conduct research for their degrees at SFU while receiving practical training in Indigenous research methodologies and First Nations public health and wellness at FNHA. We will use Indigenous and Western research methods to champion the perspectives of First Nations in BC about health and wellness.  Moreover, the students will enhance the standard reporting at FNHA through their projects' focused research aims, analyses, and contextualization. This initiative builds upon a strong established partnership between FNHA and SFU to conduct research supporting the mandate of the FNHA and First Nations in BC and to train a new generation of Indigenous health scholars.

In 2011, First Nations leadership in BC signed the BC Tripartite Framework Agreement on First Nation Health Governance to establish the FNHA and collectively made the most significant self-determination decision in BC history: taking control over their own health and wellness. The FNHA is governed by First Nations and its mandate is to transform the way healthcare is delivered to First Nations in BC, shift from an illness deficit model to wellness and increase First Nations designed services. An important part of this mandate is to facilitate high-quality data collection and analysis by and for BC First Nations. FNHA took responsibility for implementing the First Nations Regional Health Survey (RHS) in BC, which includes First Nations wellness perspectives. Our students will use existing data from the RHS for their research projects."

Designing a Model to Address the Needs of Persons with Mental Illness Following Homelessness in Two Urban Contexts: A Community Engagement Study,"['Marshall, Carrie Anne']","['Laliberte Rudman, Debbie', 'Oudshoorn, Abram', 'Webster, Fiona']","['Disadvantaged Persons', 'Health Equity', 'Homeless Persons', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Illness', 'Participatory Methods', 'Poverty']",175951.0,401503,"Existing models designed to support homeless persons with mental illness are demonstrating positive results in supporting re-housing yet have failed to address the myriad of other mental health difficulties that persist following homelessness. Contributing to this problem is the siloing of policies, resources, and providers in many Canadian communities, which has resulted in a system that is poorly integrated and struggles to provide necessary and timely support to individuals with mental illness following homelessness. This problem is compounded in small to mid-sized urban centres where competition for scarce resources among community-based services is high. Developing collaborative solutions that are built upon the perspectives of community stakeholders has the potential to identify and fill gaps that are left by a system that is currently fragmented in many Canadian communities, and more effectively meet the needs of this complex population. 
Method: Using community based participatory research (CBPR), we will: 1) Conduct an extensive stakeholder consultation with key informants in two moderate urban centres in Ontario; 2) Present the findings of this stakeholder consultation at a 2-day knowledge-to-action event involving stakeholders in each participating city; and 3) Collaborate with a group of key stakeholders to design a model for more effectively meeting the needs of persons with mental illness following homelessness that is specific to a mid-sized urban context.
Implications: Communities across Canada continue to struggle to support individuals with complex needs in the transition from homeless to housed. Collaborating across sectors and drawing on the voices of those with lived experiences of homelessness in the development of approaches is critical to identifying solutions that are feasible, relevant, and effectively target crucial outcomes that have historically challenged communities."

""crystal meth"") is a stimulant that is recognized by researchers and practitioners to be a highly addictive substance that imposes serious impacts on physical, cognitive, and psychosocial well-being. Among persons experiencing homelessness, use of methamphetamine is a serious public health problem with the prevalence of use tripling in recent years. Of the studies that have explored associations between methamphetamine use and experiences and patterns of homelessness, researchers have noted that individuals who use stimulants are housed for fewer days than individuals who use other substances, that persons who use methamphetamine frequently experience victimization while unhoused, and that homelessness is a predictor of methamphetamine use. These studies are few, and more research is needed to identify intervention strategies and to inform health and social policy.

Objectives: We propose a program of research aimed at identifying associations between homelessness and methamphetamine use to build on existing literature. 

Method: Using both convergent mixed methods and qualitative approaches, we will conduct a study informed by the lenses of social justice and health equity to uncover the ways in which methamphetamine influences the psychosocial well-being of persons who experience homelessness at both the individual and environmental levels. Our study will be conducted in two phases: 1) mixed methods interviews with persons with lived experience of homelessness; 2) qualitative interviews with service providers and landlords. 

Implications: By conducting this study, we will build on a developing body of literature exploring associations between homelessness and methamphetamine use. Specifically, by developing a more thorough understanding of the ways in which methamphetamine use is associated with well-being, we can inform the development of intervention approaches and policies aimed at mitigating adverse psychosocial consequences."

Depending on the province, adolescents up to 18 years of age may require parental permission to participate in research. Across research disciplines, there have been calls to allow young people to make decisions for themselves, yet it is unclear how these appeals have been taken up and how to best support the inclusion of adolescents in health research while attending to ethical concerns. The central questions guiding this proposal are: 1) What are the current policies and laws on the inclusion of adolescents in health research in Canada? 2) How do key stakeholders understand and uptake existing legal and ethical guidelines on the inclusion of adolescents in health research? and 3) What changes, if any, do key stakeholders recommend to policy and practice guidelines concerning the inclusion of adolescents in health research? By exploring the perspectives of researchers and decision-makers as well as legal and ethical frameworks, this approach to research shifts the focus away from the traditional research subject and instead researches up, and will integrate a poststructural analysis. There are three core elements: 1) a policy scan of legal and ethical guidelines concerning the participation of adolescents in Canadian health research; 2) a scoping review of recent Canadian health literature involving adolescents and young adults, and 3) thirty-four in-depth interviews with health researchers, policy-makers from across Canada, and decision-makers from research ethics boards. This study will identify gaps in perspectives and practice among key stakeholders and will provide new opportunities to reconsider the risks and benefits of including adolescents in Canadian health research."

Plusieurs barrières à la pratique de l'AP comme le manque de temps, les déplacements et la peur de tomber sont cités par les ainés. Les gérontechnologies, surtout celles basées sur les jeux interactifs, pourraient potentiellement dépasser ces limites. 
44 personnes âgées (65 ans et plus) précédemment indépendantes, ont été recrutées au sein du DU après avoir subi une blessure mineure. 20 d'entre elles ont complété un programme d'activité physique à domicile via une gérontechnologie (JIN), 16 ont complété un programme d'activité physique de groupe supervisé dans un centre communautaire (YMCA) et 8 ont été assignées à un groupe témoin (CON).

The objectives are: 1. to develop best practices to enhance participation of WWUD in STBBI research, 2. to examine perceived vs. objective health needs among WWUD over time and associations with social and drug-related vulnerabilities, and 3. to estimate STBBI incidence and identify potential avenues of STBBI service adaptation according to perceived vs. objective needs.
We will develop a portrait of WWUD participating or not in research projects, and co-construct new recruitment strategies with the help of people with lived experience and community workers. These strategies will be evaluated to establish best practices. We will combined quantitative (e.g., statistical analysis of answers to questionnaires) and qualitative methods (e.g., focus groups) to establish a cohort of WWUD.  Participants will be followed with repeated questionnaire, STBBI and medical evaluation. Interpretation will contextualize the impacts of overlapping vulnerabilities on service use.

Throughout Canada, policies and programs are developed to reduce health and social inequities. Our program of research will use the unique information-rich population-based Repository of administrative data housed at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy, to study the impact of multiple programs and policies introduced over the past decade which could potentially impact health and social inequities of Manitoba's children. The Repository's 97 databases are anonymized, but linkable at the person-level and to family units and neighbourhoods, and contain information on health and social services and outcomes, including: births and deaths, use of physicians and hospitals, immunization programs, educational outcomes, early childhood intervention programs, and the use of child welfare, social assistance and public housing. Our focus is on childhood trajectories, including interventions that impact social and health outcomes from birth through to age 18. We will determine which programs, or combinations of programs, improved overall outcomes, but more importantly, which ones narrowed or widened the gap in inequity.

Health inequity is unfair and avoidable or remediable differences in health among social groups. Health equity suggests that all people can reach their full health potential and should not be disadvantaged from attaining it because of their race, ethnicity, religion, gender, age, social class, socioeconomic status, or other socially determined circumstance. Throughout Canada, policies and programs are developed to reduce healthy inequity. Our program of research will use the unique information-rich population-based Repository of administrative data housed at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy, to study the impact of multiple programs and policies introduced in the past 10 years which could potentially impact health inequities of Manitobas children. The Repository's 90+ databases are anonymized, but linkable at the person-level and to family units and neighbourhoods, and contain geographically-based information on health and social services and outcomes, including:  births and deaths, use of physicians and hospitals, immunization programs, educational outcomes, early childhood intervention programs, use of child care, use of social assistance programs, and the use of public housing. Our focus is on the lifecourse of childhood, including interventions that impact social and health outcomes from birth through to age 18. We will determine which programs improved overall outcomes, but more importantly, which ones narrowed the gap in inequity and which ones widened the gap. Our research team includes partners from four government ministries as well all the regional health authorities and the Healthy Child Manitoba initiative. By working with these decision makers throughout the research process we will ensure that we ask relevant questions, interpret the data in the correct context and can assist in the translation of the research findings into evidence-informed policies and programs."

In 2017, the WHO released a consolidated guideline on the SRHR of women living with HIV. Both stated the need to recognize the rights of Indigenous people to control their own health systems. Aims: The proposed project has 3 specific aims: (1) Improved understanding of barriers affecting data collection, analysis, utilization, and communication related to SRHR of Indigenous women and girls living with HIV; (2) Increased partnerships to inform SRHR care programming, planning, and learning; and (3) Enhanced capacity of future Indigenous and allied researchers, civil society professions, and in-country leaders to collect, analyze, communicate, and use data effectively. Methodology The Canadian Aboriginal AIDS Network (CAAN) is a leader in Indigenous health and HIV-related research, and the proposed project builds on our successful partnerships with 7 countries. A '2-eyed seeing' approach will connect biomedical science with Indigenous ways of knowing.  Activities and outputs: (a) Scoping literature and policy review on the state of SRHR care of Indigenous women and girls living with HIV, and analyses of relevant international and Canadian policies; (b) Capacity-building group discussions to increase opportunities for local Indigenous women to engage in research activities; (c) Validated and context-specific survey on SRHR care from an Indigenous perspective; (d) Toolkit to reflect local project findings; (e) Context-specific Indigenous knowledge translation. Implications: This Project will enhance the ability of Indigenous women and girls to engage in all levels of research while strengthening our global Indigenous and allied partnerships."

This Catalyst Grant's objectives are to: 1) connect team members from across the country who have conducted strength-based research with Indigenous women living with and affected by HIV; 2) develop a national Team, by connecting the research groups, including Indigenous women living with HIV, Elders, Indigenous community leaders, Indigenous Organizations and Indigenous and allied researchers; and 3) develop a strategic plan to present research findings aimed to impact the lives of Indigenous women living with and affected by HIV in a positive way.
We will host a 2.5-day meeting with members from each Research Team listed above to present on their projects, discuss a larger Umbrella Team and develop a preliminary Strategic Knowledge Dissemination and Implementation Plan. We will use Indigenous methods to guide the types of knowledge products (e.g. quilts, drums) we create. Indigenous traditional ceremony, teachings and traditions will be woven throughout all steps of this project. Elders from different parts of Canada will be approached with offerings of Tobacco and cloth to request involvement.

To date, examples of community-based Aboriginal oral health research is exceedingly rare. After four years of collaboration, in 2011 our Kungatsiajuk Research Team (which is comprised of representatives from the south Labrador Inuit communities of NunatuKavut, academic researchers and dental professionals) was successful in securing a three-year CIHR Open Operating Grant. This project has identified the oral health status of NunatuKavut youth and listened to youth and their care-givers discuss oral health priorities for their communities using a community-based approach. The objectives outlined for this dissemination plan have been formulated based on the three top themes that have emerged from our story-telling sessions with youth and their care-givers. These objectives include: 1) Getting at the root causes of oral health disparities for Inuit youth through an exploration of power differentials between dentist and patient. 2) Making oral health knowledge more palatable for Inuit youth and their caregivers. 3) Providing recommendations to brush up existing oral health promotion and oral health resource and service delivery policies so that they are more aligned with the needs and realities of Inuit youth. Using the stories of Inuit youth as a catalyst for discussion, this dissemination plan will: 1. Offer a short-film contest for Inuit youth as a means for youth to convey what they would like health professionals to know about their communities. 2. Through an Aboriginal Youth Oral Health Forum create opportunity for dialogue about, and identify future research and policy directions regarding, oral health promotion and oral health resource and service delivery issues within Aboriginal communities."

But when a child suffers from oral disease and decay a smile can be a source of pain and embarrassment.  Poor oral health can affect children's self-esteem, their eating and sleeping habits and eventually their overall health. Aboriginal children in Canada have much higher rates of tooth decay than non-Aboriginal children. The children of NunatuKavut, who live in Inuit communities located in the isolated south coast region of Labrador, face many difficulties that prevent them from having 'kungatsiajuk' (a healthy smile). Many of these difficulties are related to the high cost of travelling to access specialized oral health care outside of their communities, along with very few opportunities to learn about how to prevent oral health problems from happening in the first place. We are proposing to work with the people of NunatuKavut to identify oral health needs of children (ages 0-17). With an understanding of these needs, we will create and implement culturally appropriate oral health promotion and oral health-care service delivery interventions for children. Our research team is made up of health researchers, community members and health-care providers, who hold an interest in the oral health of NunatuKavut children. The success of this program will inform policy recommendations regarding oral health in NunatuKavut and other Aboriginal communities across Canada, and importantly, it will ensure our Inuit children have 'kungatsiajuk'."

This chronic pain is often more physically, psychologically, and socially debilitating than the injury itself. Currently, drugs are the most frequently prescribed treatment for SCI pain, but drugs have many negative side-effects. The primary purpose of this project is to determine whether a regular program of exercise, performed in a person's home or in a local fitness facility, can significantly reduce chronic pain in adults with SCI. As secondary purposes, this study will test whether exercise has different effects on different types of pain, if exercise reduces pain by reducing inflammation in the body and reducing a person's sensitivity to pain, and if reductions in pain lead to improvements in how people feel about themselves and their lives. We will also test whether the exercise intervention has the potential to reduce health care costs.

Our team includes people with expertise in exercise psychology, exercise physiology, pain, physical medicine, immunology, biostatistics, health economics, and trial design and management. Our team also includes a community-researcher with lived experience of SCI, and groups and individuals who will use the knowledge generated by this study. These knowledge users represent local, provincial and national SCI organizations.

Our novel idea is that exercise performed according to a prescription specifically tailored to people with SCI, performed in one's community (rather than in a laboratory or a clinic) can be an effective behavioural strategy for reducing chronic pain. This study may also help to explain how exercise alleviates pain. By working with key stakeholders throughout the project, we will ensure the results are appropriately shared with Canadian and international end-users including clinicians, fitness programmers, people living with SCI and the community organizations that support them."

The Ohero:kon intervention in the Mohawk community of Akwesasne supports the need for youth health interventions based on Indigenous knowledge. Ohero:kon restores cultural knowledge of coming of age as a preparatory process for youth as they transition to adulthood. Through a series of teachings and ceremonies, Ohero:kon connects youth with their cultural knowledge and traditions to develop understandings of identity, life, and creation. Youth learn cultural understandings of puberty, healthy behaviours, and roles and responsibilities. Positive understandings of identity, relationships, communication and behaviours are created fostering resilience and community health. A shared desire to promote the health of Haudenosaunee youth through the restoration of Indigenous knowledge and practice has led to a Six Nations and Akwesasne community-based research partnership. Utilizing Indigenous methodologies, our objective is to evaluate and document Ohero:kon and use it as the foundation to develop a Ohero:kon ritual health intervention at Six Nations. Community Elders, Clan Mothers and the traditional mentorship system of the aunties and uncles will guide the project.

The effects in children beyond the age of 3 have not been well studied, but animal models suggest that these deficits may be permanent. Maternal and infant nutrient status is also an important determinant of neurodevelopment, but this data has not been available in any previous human study of BPA or phthalate exposure. We will make use of an established prospective pregnancy cohort (the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition study; APrON) to advance the current state-of-knowledge by examining the associations between perinatal BPA and phthalate exposure on neurodevelopment while considering the likely interaction with key nutrients in mothers and their infants. Specifically, we will analyze the concentrations of BPA and phthalate metabolites in spot maternal urine samples, measure the status of nutrients in perinatal blood samples from the mother and infant, and evaluate child performance at age 3, and again at age 5, on measures of intelligence, motor function, executive function, memory and behaviour. We hypothesize that perinatal exposure to BPA or phthalates will be associated with lower performance, but we will further examine if the effects are attenuated by sufficient nutrient status, or made worse by low nutrient status, methylmercury co-exposure, or lead co-exposure. We will also test if children who were exposed to higher levels of BPA and phthalates in the perinatal period have slower rates of development between ages 3 and 5. We anticipate that the results of this study will contribute to public health protection in Canada and abroad. By identifying nutrients in the perinatal period that can attenuate the subsequent adverse effects in children, risk mitigation strategies may be quickly communicated."

The research proposed in this application will determine whether blood telomere length is associated with the risk of developing breast cancer in a prospective study.  Telomeres are pieces of DNA on the ends of chromosomes that protect them from damage.  Telomeres shorten with age, and the length of telomeres in cells in the blood may be an indicator of biological aging and susceptibility to cancer.  If the length of telomeres in blood cells from women who develop breast cancer is different from that in women who do not have breast cancer, then blood telomere length may be a useful marker to identify women at increased risk for breast cancer. Further research to understand the reason for this difference may lead to ways to prevent breast cancer in the future."
The Costs of Aging-in-Place for Frail Older People,"['Martin-Misener, Ruth', 'Goodwin, Sharon', 'MacDonald, MJ', 'Ganann, Rebecca L', 'Warner, Grace']","['Campbell, Angus', 'Swan, Ron', 'MacDonald, Marilyn T', 'McKibbon, Shelley', 'Moody, Elaine M', 'Ploeg, Jenny', 'Shaw, Lynn', 'Weeks, Lori']","['Community-Dwelling', 'Frailty', 'Older Adults', 'Out-Of-Pocket Expenses']",25000.0,383828,"Many countries are experiencing an aging population; there are greater numbers of older people than ever before. Older people often prefer to remain in their home and communities as they age. Some older people experience health changes that mean they need supports to live in the community. This is particularly true for frail older people, those who have multiple health conditions and who generally have a harder time recovering from illness or injury. Supports to live in the community for frail older people are often associated with out-of-pocket expenses that are not covered by health insurance. These costs have to be paid by frail older people themselves or their families or friends who care for them, and can contribute to financial burden and decisions to move into long-term care facilities. 
We will conduct a systematic scoping review of the literature to find research studies and other literature that discuss the out-of-pocket expenses for frail older people living in the community and their caregivers. This review will be supported by consultations with frail older people and their caregivers, as well as stakeholder such as policy makers, community organizations and companies that provide support in the community. The scoping review will help us identify areas where further research will help to better understand the costs of aging in place, as well as summarize the types of research that have already been done.  
Identifying the literature that reports the out-of-pocket costs of aging-in-place for frail older people is a first step to developing better supports for addressing the costs of living in the community for frail older people and to help older people plan for staying at home as they age."

"Better understanding vulnerability to the consequences of discrimination: Externalizing behaviours and social support as moderators between racism, sexism and homophobia and depressive and substance use outcomes","['Martin-Storey, Alexa']","['Benner, Aprile', 'Déry, Michèle', 'Dirks, Melanie A', 'Georgiades, Katholiki K', 'Paquette, Geneviève', 'Temcheff, Caroline E']","['Depressive Symptoms', 'Externalizing Behavior Problems', 'Homophobia', 'Racism', 'Sexism', 'Social Support', 'Substance Use']",409275.0,401842,"In Canada, the three most common stigmatized identities for adolescents are those based on gender, race/ethnicity and sexuality. Discrimination based on these stigmatized identities (i.e., sexism, racism, and homophobia) increases individual level risk for depressive symptoms and problematic substance use. Not all youth who experience these kinds of discrimination, however, are at risk for depressive symptoms and substance use. This project focuses on externalizing behaviour and social support as two key risk and resilience processes to better understand variation in the consequences of discrimination. This project has two objectives. The first is to use quantitative methods to explore if the links between sexism, racism, and homophobia and depressive symptoms and substance use are mitigated or exacerbated by social support and externalizing behaviour, respectively. This objective will be tested using secondary data analyses with four existing datasets. The second objective employs a mixed-methods approach to examine how sex and gender shape the link between externalizing behaviours and social support and depressive symptom and substance use outcomes. Quantitative analyses with a longitudinal dataset will be complimented with qualitative interviews of 48 youth who will speak to how their gender and sexual identities shape how they are treated by others, and the consequences of this discrimination for their health and wellbeing. The findings have clinical implications for (1) identifying pockets of vulnerability among youth experiencing discrimination, (2) understanding how social support can be used to protect youth against the consequences of discrimination, and (3) focusing intervention efforts on addressing discrimination among youth with externalizing problems. This project provides a practical framework for addressing the impact of discrimination by identifying factors that serve to augment or mitigate its consequences."

As the cannabis legalization in Canada sought to protect youth from potential harms of cannabis use, it is essential to understand which patterns of cannabis use are associated with negative consequences in adulthood. This project proposes to investigate the associations between youth cannabis use and later physical health, mental health, and psychosocial outcomes across four decades of life. We will measure these outcomes using objective administrative data on healthcare utilization and governmental tax reports linked to three large population-based longitudinal studies: the Québec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (1500 children, followed from birth 25 years), the Québec Longitudinal Study of Kindergarten Children (2000 children, followed from 6 to 40 years), and the Montreal Longitudinal and Experimental Study (800 children, followed from 6 to 40 years). We will estimate how different patterns of cannabis use between ages 12 and 23 (based on age of initiation and frequency of cannabis use) are associated with healthcare use for mental and physical health problems as well as personal earnings, welfare receipts, and unemployment later in life. We will explore sex- and gender-specific differences in these associations. Our findings will allow clinicians, researchers, and policymakers to develop better prevention and treatment programs to avoid possible consequences of cannabis use in the short and long term."
"Risk for disordered eating among North American Asian emerging adults: Examination of the roles of ethnic identity, parenting, and satisfaction of basic psychological needs","['Ma, Ruofan']",['N/A'],"['Asian', 'Basic Psychological Need Satisfaction', 'Culture', 'Eating Disorders', 'Ethnicity', 'Moderated Mediation', 'Parenting', 'Psychological Control', 'Self-Determination Theory', 'Structural Equation Models']",105000.0,436990,"Eating disorders can result in serious medical consequences, including electrolyte disturbance and cardiac arrhythmias, and have the highest mortality rates among any psychiatric disorders. Asians constitute the largest group of visible minorities in Canada and, compared to White Canadians, have similar or higher rates of eating disorders, yet they are less likely to receive treatment. Emerging adulthood (18-25 years of age) is a developmental period when individuals are at particularly high risk for developing eating disorders. During this period, many parents continue to play a significant role in emerging adults' development. However, the impact of particular parenting practices on the children may vary across cultures. For example, parental control is perceived negatively in Western cultures, but may be perceived as well-meaning in Asian cultures. Therefore, strong ethnic identity in Asian emerging adults may buffer them against the negative impact of parental control. That is, for Asian emerging adults who identify strongly with their ethnic culture, parental control may not pose as much risk for psychological adjustment, including eating disorders, as for those who have a weaker ethnic identity. The proposed research examines this possibility and contributes to understanding how various individual, familial and cultural factors may explain Asian emerging adults' risk for eating disorders. Findings will inform theories regarding psychosocial risks for eating disorders in Asians living in North America by clarifying the role of ethnic identification in their mental health. These findings could also inform the development of more family-oriented, culturally-sensitive intervention and prevention programs attending to the needs of Asian emerging adults at risk. We note that causes of eating disorders are multifaced and cannot be solely attributed to one's familial environment. Instead, families usually play an important role in one's treatment and recovery."
Women online: Does meeting partners through the internet place women at increased risk for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV?,"['Masaro, Cindy']",['N/A'],"['Internet', 'Mixed Methods', 'Perceptions', 'Risk', 'Sexually Transmitted Infections', 'Women']",105000.0,184359,"Internet dating sites have increased in popularity for the pursuit of romantic and sexual relationships. Amongst health care professionals there is concern that these sites provide a faster way to spread sexually transmitted infections (STI) because people have access to a larger group of partners possibly leading to an increased numbers of sexual partners and riskier sexual behaviours. Research focussing on men who have sex with men indicates that people using the internet for dating and sex are more likely to engage in riskier sexual behaviours and to acquire an STI. The extent to which women's romantic online relationships develop into sexual off-line relationships, or the extent to which women use the internet for sex seeking has not yet been explored. STI research has shown that once intimacy and trust develop in relationships, perceptions of STI risk and the motivation to engage in safer sex are lowered. Recent research indicates that intimacy and trust develop more rapidly on line than with face-to-face communication. To date, no studies have examined whether women using internet dating sites for romance or sex are more at risk for an STI or HIV. 

This study will investigate whether women using the internet to access romantic or sexual partners are at greater risk for STI or HIV than those who do not. In addition, this study will explore how women's online relationships develop with respect to intimacy, trust, and sexual risk behaviour, and examine how the development of online relationships differs from off line face to face relationships."

This project responds to the need to develop innovative research approaches rooted in the ways in which Aboriginal/ Indigenous and African Diaspora worldwide generate and integrate knowledge. Project goals include: (1) completion of a preliminary synthesis of existing literature; (2) creation of a discussion framework based on the results of the scoping review; (3) conducting consultations with Aboriginal/Indigenous and African Diaspora HIV researchers and community members at the AIDS 2012 International conference in Washington, DC (July 2012), and; (4) developing a larger protocol enabling continued theory development. Project outcomes will include: i) a framework summarizing key common and distinctive features of decolonizing/ Indigenous/Southern methodologies for use by researchers working with Aboriginal/Indigenous and ACB populations; ii) a community report documenting project findings; iii) a finalized research proposal for submission to CIHR; and, iv) a journal article by team members. This foundational work is particularly timely for the HIV field given that Aboriginal/Indigenous peoples and ACB communities are disproportionately affected by the epidemic in Canada, and broader health inequities more generally. The impact of this work is far-reaching with the potential to transform the way we engage in HIV community-based research in Canada, and other fields as well."

This will contribute to new knowledge and a greater understanding of how to work together. We will use the protocol to develop more innovative HIV research responding to community identified needs. 

This application lines up well with the CIHR Catalyst Grant funding objectives by supporting research partnerships and emerging research initiatives. The project team is ready to undertake research but needs a solid foundation between member countries and for IIWGHA as a whole before we begin. In summary, the objectives of this project are to: 1) generate and share knowledge through the development of a research protocol; 2) strengthen international partnerships to undertake research together; and 3) develop a research operating grant to implement an Indigenous specific epidemiology and surveillance project. 

We will approach our work through a number of frameworks that capture our values as Indigenous researchers. The Two-Eyed seeing perspective will bring traditional Indigenous and western academic approaches together. We will ground ourselves in Indigenous knowledges and a community-based research (CBR) framework which is based on mutually respectful and ethical partnerships. In order to engage respectfully in North/South and South/South relationships we will emphasize decolonizing our research methods and processes.

While these approaches are lifesaving, they are not enough to make a meaningful difference within Indigenous communities. Mainstream harm reduction models focus too narrowly on substance using behaviours, neglecting the broader social and system-wide issues that contribute to and intersect with substance use for Indigenous peoples in the first place. For Indigenous communities, harm reduction = reducing the harms of colonization. It is inclusive of, but much broader than, a focus on using substances or safer sex. Indigenous harm reduction is a way of life, rooted in Indigenous Knowledges and worldviews, combined with the best of what the Western world can offer, and focused on mitigating the living legacy of colonization. Among Indigenous communities however, harm reduction can be contentious and contested. If Indigenous approaches to harm reduction are to be successful, communities and community leaders must find ways to engage in conversations informed by evidence and understanding to facilitate inclusion of all Indigenous people in ceremony, programs and community life. In 2018, we received PHAC funding to develop an Indigenous Harm Reduction policy brief and 4 accompanying case studies that highlight wise practices in Indigenous Harm Reduction. In this proposal, we seek funds to create a culturally-relevant and community-friendly online package to disseminate the concepts and messaging to make this more accessible to the individuals and communities who need them. Specifically, we will develop: 1) an implementation guide to assist communities in putting the principles into practice; 2) a social media package; 3) a series of videos; 4) a website/portal to host our materials; and 5) two webinars to assist communities in how to use our resources."

This scan will result in the co-creation of wise practices for culturally responsive Indigenous harm reduction services which will support  harm reduction organizations in sustaining and improving the ways that they deliver harm reduction services to their Indigenous clients. 
 METHODS: The methodology of this environmental scan is guided by several core foundations of Indigenous Ways of Knowing and Doing, OCAP, Two-Eyed Seeing, and Ermine's 'ethical space of engagement.' This environmental scan - using a strengths-based, trauma-informed, culturally responsive, and asset-mapping approach - will include published and grey literature, as well as sharing circles and interviews with key informants representing harm reduction organizations. The research team of experts in harm reduction, knowledge translation, and Indigenous epistemologies will ensure that this project proceeds from an Indigenous research epistemology in accordance with CIHR's definition of Indigenous Health Research and Meaningful and Culturally Safe Health Research.
 OUTCOMES: This project will create an evidence base of culturally safe harm reduction programming for Indigenous Peoples in the context of COVID-19. We will subsequently use this evidence to develop a suite of capacity-building resources for harm reduction programs and services that are grounded in Indigenous Knowledges for diverse community contexts."

Drawing on Indigenous ways of knowing and doing and a commitment to community-engagement. 
Emphasizing lived experience, we know that it is important to share the knowledge we've developed so that Indigenous Peoples might thrive. In sharing what we know, we understand this is a sacred pursuit, follows cultural protocols, occurs in ceremony, is community engaged, and supports self-determination. To answer our research questions we plan to critically review how we are currently using Indigenous knowledges to mobilize what we know and to use this knowledge to develop new and innovative ways of meaningfully sharing research knowledge. 
We will assess whether we have reached intended audiences, whether the information we provide contributes to positive social change, outcomes or services using our original grant data. Our network of brilliant colleagues in academic and community settings and community leaders living with HIV, HCV, STBBI and issues related to mental health and aging need greater access to CAAN's research. 
On of our successes is our response to the lack of Indigenous HIV CBR literature - the open access Journal of Indigenous HIV Research. In addition, CAAN hosts workshops as part of our Annual Meeting, and hosts bi-annual Wise Practices-an Indigenous CBR gathering. Our team's productivity is exceptional, but the missing link to fully mobilize our research is greater emphasis to localize our Indigenous knowledge translation strategies leading to positive and meaningful community impacts."

We witness Indigenous Peoples navigating ongoing and layered syndemics every day. For this reason, CAAN's research mandate is strengths-based, culturally safe, and grounded in Indigenous knowledges and solutions. CAAN's research with Indigenous-led front-line service organizations responding to HIV, HCV, and TB lays a foundation to sustain a response to the continually evolving COVID-19 situation and its consequences for intersecting pandemics.

We know the experiences of working through other 'demics' informs organizational and personal responses to COVID-19 and we aim to understand how to identifying practices and processes others may find useful as well as to provide space for reflection and integration of the full experience, which may include layers of tragedy and grief. This is the lived experience of front-line work even without a global pandemic; we intend to bring to the fore what can be learned from the people serving in these contexts every day in support of the organizations and to highlight the staff wisdom.

The research will support identifying, implementing, and sharing culturally safe, Indigenous community-led solutions to address the COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences by addressing the research areas of culturally safe covid-19 prevention, preparedness, response (and recovery) for indigenous peoples.

This project will facilitate early-stage planning of a community-based project designed to support recently released Indigenous mothers and establish partnerships between researchers and relevant Indigenous community organizations in three cities across Ontario. We will (1) conduct a review of programs and services in Ontario that are currently available to Indigenous mothers transitioning back into society to identify gaps and strengths in current wraparound supports and (2) build upon existing partnerships and create new relationships with Indigenous communities and criminal justice-involved organizations in Toronto, Thunder Bay, and Kingston to collaboratively determine the direction of the possible project. We will host participating organizations and community members at a two-day planning meeting in Toronto, Ontario to discuss the priorities of the community and reach consensus on the implementation of an intervention that will serve to support and build capacity among previously incarcerated Indigenous mothers. Knowledge will be generated through Sharing Circles - an Indigenous small-group discussion - with key stakeholders, including Indigenous women who have experienced incarceration, Elders, community partners involved in the criminal justice field, and the research team.

The need for an interdisciplinary team is critical to study LBP multidimensional contributing factors. Experts from diverse disciplines including sensorimotor determinants of pain, kinesiology, neurobiology, epigenetics, genetics, psychology, spinal/cerebral imaging, trajectory of care and health care resource use, epidemiology, patient pain experience and healthcare communication founded the Quebec Back Pain Consortium to address this challenge. Their main objective is to identify biopsychosocial factors predicting who will develop chronic LBP and recover after an initial episode of acute LBP. To accomplish this goal, we will recruit individuals suffering from acute LBP across the province of Quebec. After inclusion, all participants will fill web-based questionnaires regarding the traditional risk factors related to LBP (e.g. depression, work-related compensation, etc. - the Databank) and collect saliva and blood (for epigenetic and genetic analysis) samples (Biobank). Thereafter, their pain trajectories will be followed over two years using an online platform. During that period, satellite projects will investigate specific risk factors including neuroanatomical, biomechanical, and physical activity. Advanced statistical methods will be used to integrate and interpret the data. This unifying cohort study will provide an integrated view on the transition from acute to chronic LBP or recovery in a Canadian population that is not confined to individual disciplinary silos. Results will allow to identify individuals at risk of developing chronic LBP, and ultimately, guide the development of specific interventions to intervene rapidly before pain becomes chronic."
Household environmental framework pertaining to childhood obesity: Improving our measures of the familial environment,"['Masse, Louise C']","['Baranowski, Tom', 'Beauchamp, Mark R', 'Hughes, Sheryl O', ""O'Connor, Teresia""]","['Childhood Obesity', 'Familial Environment', 'Item Bank', 'Nutrition', 'Physical Activity', 'Psychometric', 'Questionnaire Design', 'Validation']",573157.0,238438,"Childhood obesity is rapidly increasing in Canada as well as in all developed countries. Since the family is important in shaping children's behaviours, parents can profoundly influence children's physical activity and dietary habits. Certain parenting practices (e.g., restrictive and controlling practices) have a more negative impact on a child's ability to develop healthy behaviours while other practices have more positive effects. Although parenting practices are widely recognized as an important target for family-based intervention, our ability to understand the influence of the family is hampered by our ability to measure parenting practices. Researchers have developed different ways to measure parenting practices related to physical activity and nutrition; however no agreement has been reached in the scientific community. To remedy this situation this study proposes to first engage the international scientific community in developing a common conceptual framework for assessing parenting practices related to physical activity and nutrition. We will then use this information to standardize our measurement of parenting practices by developing a bank of items. We will assess the validity and reliability of the parenting measures by administering the bank of items to 3150 parents of children 3 to 16 years of age. Lastly, we will conduct a pilot study with 88 families to assess relationships among parenting practices, children's behaviours, and children's weight. Findings from this study will provide the groundwork for future research aimed at understanding the influence of parenting practices. Having better methods to assess how parenting affects a child's weight is relevant to both the research community and health practitioners, and is necessary for designing effective interventions to identify the active component of the familial environment in relation to childhood obesity."

There is a strong consensus that school-based policy strategies may have the greatest impact on childhood obesity, since such an approach can reach the majority of youths. However, it is unknown whether obesity prevention-focused policies are fully implemented or implemented as intended and whether such policies translate into change in physical activity (PA), nutrition behaviours and overall weight (Body Mass Index (BMI)) among the target student population. In British Columbia (BC), a number of policy strategies to address childhood obesity have recently been enacted, including the BC Ministries of Health and Education Guidelines for Food and Beverage Sales (GFBS), and the BC Ministry of Education Daily Physical Activity (DPA) initiative.  The primary aims of this study are to evaluate the implementation of the GFBS policy and DPA initiative across BC and examine factors influencing their implementation. Our secondary aim is to examine the influence of school PA and nutrition policies on student PA and eating behaviours and overall weight (BMI). All BC school principals (N = 1399 based on our eligibility criteria) will be surveyed to address our primary aim. In addition, we will use qualitative interviews and school audits (n=25 schools) to gain more in-depth knowledge about factors that influence implementation.  To address our secondary aim, we will perform an analysis of previously collected data among 513 schools and among 29,315 students. Findings from this research will allow the province of BC to make evidence-based course corrections where necessary and provide evidence for continued investment in school-based approaches. Results will also inform other jurisdictions in Canada enacting or considering school-based policy strategies to improve students' health."

Yet there are no Canadian guidelines and few provincial guidelines that govern the physical activity environment of childcare settings. In recognition of this gap, and the importance of the preschool years, the BC government and partners have developed Active Play Standards and communication and capacity-building interventions to support implementation of the Standards. Our research group is ready to take advantage of this opportunity to increase our understanding about the effect of supporting these Standards with communication and capacity-building strategies on the policies and practices of childcare providers and the health behaviours of children while in their care. In addition, we will explore the hierarchy of factors (individual, childcare settings and regional) that facilitate or hinder full implementation of the Standards.

RentSafe research findings1,2reveal significant KTA gaps and confirm that lack of knowledge is but one impediment to tenants’ ability to secure healthier housing conditions. We will undertake two interrelated interventions designed to:(1) create the conditions necessary for tenants to act upon knowledge of housing-related health risks and(2) optimize the health/social services system’s responsiveness to such concerns.Drawing upon diverse expertise in RentSafe, we will explore whether and howinvestment in human interactionvia (1) tenant-led peer outreach and (2) increased professional connections among service providers can improve tenant self-advocacy and intersectoral system responsiveness.BackgroundEnvironmental health risks in housing can have a profound impact on residents’ health. Robust scientific evidence links housing-related exposures with multiple health risks: mould and asthma,3,13radon and lung cancer,4,lead and IQ decrements in children,5inadequate cooling and heat stress,6among others. These links underscore the important role of housingqualityas a determinant of health, particularly for children and other vulnerable groups.7Despite concerted efforts to promote public knowledge and the preventable nature of these risks, housing-related exposures continue to exacerbate health inequities.Multiple health and social services agencies have roles in mitigating housing-related health risks. Baseline research conducted through our Trillium-funded RentSafe initiative, led by the Canadian Partnership for Children’s Health & Environment (CPCHE), points to two key gaps in knowledge-to-action on housing-related health risks. First is a lack of empowerment among tenants, stemming from factors such as fear of eviction, cultural and linguistic barriers and lack of knowledge of their rights. Second is the inadequate flow of information and collaborative links among health/social service providers.MethodologyWe will conduct two interventions to assess the value of investing in human relationships9,10,11as an actionable means of fostering tenant self-advocacy and improving system responsiveness:(1) Design and conduct tenant-led peer outreach on housing-related health risks in Owen Sound (a RentSafe site);(2) Convene local stakeholders to critically examine the current flow of information/assistance in response to housing-related health concerns and identify ways to optimize coordination and impact, via a curriculum informed by our novelequity-focused KT (EqKT)framework11and 2011 CIHR-funded Knowledge Leaders training pilot12which targeted barriers to intersectoral action through human relations and experiential learning.We will evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions through pre-/post- surveys, participant journals, focus groups and social network mapping.Anticipated resultsThe proposed pilot-scale initiative will:assess the value of investing in human relations between tenants (peer-to-peer) and among service professionals (human connections within institutional networks) as a strategy for improving local/regional systems for addressing housing-related health risks; andinform RentSafe next steps and replicable action across Ontario and elsewhere."
Holding Space for frontline Indigenous leadership in community-driven responses to the housing and overdose crises in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside,"['Masuda, Jeffrey R', 'De Leeuw, Sarah']","['Greenwood, Margo L', 'Pranteau, Samantha']","['Community Based Participatory Research', 'Community Organizing', 'Harm Reduction', 'Healthy Housing', 'Indigenizing', 'Indigenous Leadership', 'Public Health Systems', 'Single Room Occupancy Housing']",612000.0,410230,"Our research team supports frontline Indigenous community health organizers who are leading the public health response to the twin housing and overdose fatality crisis in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside. There are over 5000 people who live in Single Room Occupancy (SRO) Hotels. Conditions in many SRO hotels are unlivable, yet they are the only option for people on low income, mental health survivors, sex workers, and people who use drugs. It is a colonial crisis of epic proportions: at least 35% of SRO tenants self-identify as Indigenous. But the twin crisis has also spurred a grassroots response led by Indigenous leaders in the DTES. While the crisis is predominantly affecting Indigenous men, the response is largely led by women and 2SLGBTQ+ leaders in the community, including among our team. Building on our previous research in support of housing and harm reduction organizing led by SRO tenants, we propose a project that strengthens our team by ""holding space"" for our Indigenous leaders, protecting them from harmful conditions of low pay and dangerous work, and supporting their ability to sustain themselves and their relations in a self-determined way. To do this, we will work with our partners and respected local Elders to organize five years of restorative Indigenous methodologies centred on land-based retreats and sharing circles that allow us to support each other, reflect on the trauma that surrounds us, and strengthen a wider coalition of Indigenous frontline organizations. This approach to research will ultimately tackle colonial processes in public health that have relied heavily on community-based Indigenous leaders to deliver culturally-appropriate care, while leaving them in short term, low wage contracts. Our partnership includes major grassroots organizations working in the DTES and to national Indigenous health organizations. Our project will make important contributions to the growing field of Indigenous public health in Canada."

Interventions to Improve Health among Canadian Prisoners.,"['Matheson, Flora I']",['N/A'],"['Addictions', 'At Risk Youth', 'Gender', 'Integrated Knowledge Mobilization', 'Intersectoral Partnerships', 'Mental Health', 'Prisoners', 'Qualitative', 'Quantitative', 'Stigma']",,297453,"Canadians who are incarcerated or are at risk of incarceration (both youth and adults) have multiple health needs, fueled by personal experiences of poverty, violence, trauma, addiction and mental illness. Health problems, such as mental illness and addictions, can thrust people into contact with the police and other aspects of the criminal justice system (CJS). Effective health interventions for those at risk of CJS involvement and those already in the system must result from joint collaborations between the health system and non-health infrastructure and services (e.g., correctional, housing) since the social determinants of poor health are often the same determinants of imprisonment (e.g., poverty, unemployment, early school leaving/low-literacy, homelessness/under-housed). This Chair in Applied Public Health entitled, Interventions to Improve Health among Canadian Prisoners, will uniquely bring together leading experts, robust scientific evidence and effective integration of knowledge translation strategies to improve the health of prisoners and those at risk of entering or re-entering the penal system. The objectives of the Chair program are to: 1) identify specific health interventions that will benefit this vulnerable population, 2) work with key partners in both health and non-health sectors to implement promising interventions, and 3) train a new generation of researchers in best practice for intersectoral partnership development and improve their knowledge of the social determinants of health and criminal involvement. The end-goal of the Chair is to reduce health problems among those at risk of CJS involvement, those incarcerated and those at risk of re-incarceration. Reducing health problems may have the added benefit of keeping at risk people from going to jail or re-entering jail after release."

Mortality is higher among people with psychiatric problems relative to the general public and other comparison patient groups. Patients suffering from chronic pain may self-medicate and become addicted to drugs in an effort to cope.

The primary objective of this research is to explore whether the presence of one of these condition creates an increased risk in the development of additional health problems, and if so, to understand the nature of multiple health problems among men and women. The spotlight here is on mental illness, substance abuse and ten high incidence/high prevalence chronic physical health conditions (e.g., cancer, hypertension). 

The study is timely since the Provincial Forum and the Mental Health Implementation Task Forces (2000/01) were mandated to examine the current process of delivery of mental health services in Ontario and to make recommendations for mental health care reform. One of the Task Force recommendations was to address current gaps in mental health services for those who have a dual diagnosis and/or concurrent disorder. Another concern identified was that mental health services and supports are not always accommodating to all people in terms of cultural, gender or special needs. 

The study will inform present clinical practice which is currently, not optimally designed to address multiple needs of patients with mental illness/addictions; time constraints often force physicians to address the most salient health problem (e.g., depression, anxiety, schizophrenia) so that preventive procedures are not delivered (e.g., pap tests, hypertension). This is the first study in Canada to inquire into this topic, and specifically to study co-morbidity from a gendered perspective"

In many First Nations communities, the disempowerment of girls and women as a result of colonialist patriarchal policies has been profound, placing them at risk physically, socially, and emotionally. It has also resulted in the devaluation of the inter and intragenerational relational behaviors that colonialism deemed feminine, and thus inferior. In the proposed research, we will work together with female and two-spirit First Nations youth to established culturally-grounded and gender affirming peer mentoring programs for youth across the gender spectrum, as such supports are expected to be integral to youths' sense of belonging and positive mental health. In addition, together with First Nations communities, we are proposing to enable youth to create digital stories of strong female role models, thereby providing inspiration and fostering respect. Finally, we will encourage First Nations youth who are about to become mothers to bring together their trusted social supports to co-create their collective story of strength to be gifted to her newborn later in life, and in so doing, consolidate the supports surrounding young mothers (and infants), and affirming these mothers' value and purpose. Ongoing multi-method (qualitative, quantitative, and behavioral) measurements will form the basis of formative and outcome evaluations of the program effects on youth wellness. Qualitative analyses of the program outputs (co-created training curriculum, stories) will be conducted to understand the processes by which empowered gender and cultural identities are expressed and consolidated. It is expected that by affirming the strengths of First Nations women, gender relations, social support behaviors, coping skills, and the health and wellness of First Nations youth will be enhanced."

Cette crise sanitaire a entraîné une hausse de 22% de l'absentéisme en raison des PSM chez le PSSS dans le monde. Les stresseurs psychosociaux (SP) du travail sont impliqués dans le développement des PSM. Les milieux de travail québécois devront bientôt identifier les SP auxquels leur personnel est exposé et les inclure dans leurs activités préventives. Or, peu d'outils permettent aux employeurs d'être autonomes dans le diagnostic des SP. Pour répondre à ce besoin, notre équipe a développé un outil numérique d'identification et d'analyse automatisées des stresseurs psychosociaux du travail. Par ailleurs, pour une amélioration plus durable de la santé mentale du personnel, il est recommandé d'améliorer l'environnement de travail tout en offrant des stratégies de gestion du stress au personnel. Parmi ces stratégies figure la thérapie du rire, qui s'est montrée bénéfique pour la santé mentale au travail. À notre connaissance, aucune étude antérieure n'a porté simultanément sur la diminution des SP et la thérapie du rire au travail. Ce projet comblera cette lacune en mettant en œuvre et en évaluant l'efficacité d'une intervention combinant la réduction des SP et la thérapie du rire. Des approches de recherche qualitative et quantitative seront utilisées. Les personnes participantes seront recrutées au sein d'établissements de santé et services sociaux québécois. Environ 20 équipes de travail sont visées. Les résultats montreront dans quelle mesure des équipes de travail munies d'une solution numérique pour dresser le diagnostic des SP et exposées à de la thérapie du rire parviennent à contrôler les SP et à améliorer leur santé mentale et productivité au travail.

According to many researchers the incidence is even higher, and the Federal and Provincial governments have made autism a higher priority. Medical scholarship on autism has established that certain risk factors like prematurity in a pregnancy can lead to a child developing autism. These findings have sparked great interest in health forums across Canada, the US, and the world as numbers of children diagnosed with autism continue to rise. Important questions are being raised by many. How do parents treat and care for their children after a diagnosis? How do educators and communities respond to the needs of persons of any age with autism in order to best serve them in their ongoing development? How can I better understand what it feels like to have autism? 

These and many other questions will be answered though our Café event. The objective of the Café will be to showcase the latest research on autism, make the public aware of resources and support networks available, and promote recent advances of care for those diagnosed with autism. The Café will feature expert speakers and researchers on the topic of proper care for individuals with autism, encouraging Canadians from all sectors of society to engage CIHR health researchers and contribute their views on current research. By first addressing how autism may develop and its root causes, the Café will engage its audience on how best to respond to individuals with autism in homes, care centers, and in the community. Additionally, our speakers will suggest research and findings that promote innovative treatments with autistic children and mature autistic adults. Not only will this Café  shed light on the causes of autism, but it will improve public understanding of the health and well-being of persons with autism and how best to deliver quality care to Canadians who need it most."

By the end of the study, we will have provided Enriched Support to all of our clinical and research staff and many learners (> 6,000 people). We will test the effectiveness of the Peer Support Champions by measuring trends in burnout and other effects of stress over the course of the study in a subgroup of these hospital workers (~1000 people). We have assembled a team of experts in infection prevention and control, healthcare workers' stress and resilience, and continuous professional education. Because occupational stress and burnout are very common in healthcare, we expect this work to produce knowledge that is valuable well beyond the current outbreak."
"Opportunity costs: Underemployment, a determinant of mental health inequities between immigrant and Canadian-born labour force participants","['Mawani, Farah N']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,383179,"This study aimed to examine the association of underemployment (unemployment or overqualification) to self-rated mental health: 1. in workers 18-64yrs in Canada (excluding full-time students and those with long-term physical or mental conditions limiting work activity), and 2. between a. immigrants and Canadian-born workers, and b. recent immigrant (in Canada <10yrs) and long-term  (in Canada 10 yrs or more) immigrant workers. The study sampled 53 409 workers from the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 2.1 (2003). Underemployment was positively associated with fair/poor mental health for workers in Canada. The association of unemployment to fair/poor mental health was similar for immigrant and Canadian-born workers, but there were differences in the association of overqualification to fair/poor self-rated mental health between immigrant and Canadian-born workers. There was a significant association of overqualification to fair/poor mental health for immigrant, but not for Canadian-born workers. This suggests a different experience of overqualification, and need for tailored health and employment policies and programs for immigrant workers. This research highlights the underemployment as a socioeconomic status measure of particular importance to reducing mental health inequities between immigrant and Canadian-born workers. It suggests the need for a whole of government approach to minimize societal exclusion of immigrants selected based on their education and experience."

Also, consumption of a healthy diet varies between socioeconomic groups. We will study the link between cancer risk and different dietary combinations of red and processed meat, vegetables and fruit, and fiber. We will also examine differences in these relations across socioeconomic groups. We will use available data from Alberta's Tomorrow Project, which follows since 2000 a large group of 26,788 adults aged 35-69 years with no previous history of cancer. The regular linkage with the Alberta Cancer Registry provides new cases of cancer among study participants. Results will generate important knowledge to help reduce the cancer burden among Canadians by tailoring existing recommendations and targeting specific socioeconomic groups."

South Africa has the highest number of people living with HIV (5.6 million) and the highest incidence of TB and HIV-TB worldwide (981 and 591 per 100 000, respectively). Latent TB infection (LTBI) is a dormant stage preceding TB disease. Although treatment for LTBI in the form of Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) has been used commonly in the developed world, it has not been used in countries with high HIV-TB incidence until now. In 2011, IPT community-wide IPT has been offered to PLWH at clinics in the Edendale Hospital catchment area of KwaZulu-Natal province, South Africa (an area of high TB-HIV and MDR-TB prevalence). The proposed catalyst project will focus on previously unexamined community understandings of TB infection versus disease, and the beliefs and attitudes about IPT following implementation among six communities (two peri-urban, two rural, and two remote) in the Edendale catchment area. The researchers will involve community members as co-facilitators, participants, and community advisors, all of whom have or will contribute to research design, data collection, review of findings, and dissemination. In addition to providing important feedback on IPT implementation to policymakers, themes developed in focus groups discussions and ranked by advisory teams will contribute to the research direction of an upcoming IPT effectiveness study and be used to interpret its results."

Putting the Research to Work (PRW), a 10 year old research partnership, is an intersectoral partnership that consists of 17 community, funder, government (municipal, provincial, federal), and university partners representing multiple levels (from frontline to decision-maker) and sectors (e.g., health, children's services, employment). PRW has available to it extensive information in three areas critical for decision-making for low-income families: (a) the health and well-being of over 1100 children and their families over three years, including information on over 1400 variables reflecting demographic characteristics, social determinants of health (e.g., ethnicity, immigrant/aboriginal status, educational attainment, labour market attachment, housing, community participation, social support, use of services), and health outcomes, (b) service delivery dynamics for low-income families; and (c) collaboration among intersectoral partners (e.g., leadership, governance). The PRW partnership has developed a culture that is not only receptive to using research evidence, but is eager to learn how to do it effectively. It has determined the knowledge translation goal to be increasing the capacity of partners to apply evidence within and across their systems. By hiring a knowledge broker and communications specialist, and by hosting a spring institute, partners will have increased capacity to apply evidence within and across their systems to improve health outcomes for low-income families based on the database described above."

Many other Canadian municipalities are developing poverty alleviation, reduction, or elimination plans; provinces are following, and the federal government is currently developing a national poverty reduction strategy. The success of these efforts depends on large, multisectoral collaboration and leadership, and ongoing and intentional learning and evaluation processes.  However, the latter rarely occurs (Cabaj, 2011; Lowen, 2009); measurement of these efforts are prohibitive as they require significant coordination, expertise, and cost. Through this IPPH opportunity, we will be able to study population level impacts of a comprehensive and bold poverty elimination plan that will inform efforts on what other Canadian cities can do to address poverty and ultimately have healthier cities."

EndPovertyEdmonton (EPE) is an organization convening agencies and companies using inclusive economic strategies. However, these agencies and companies report challenges to their implementation, like language barriers and discrimination. While EPE intervenes on multiple levels with government and industry, it is unclear which strategies lead to recruiting and retaining diverse people into good jobs (e.g., jobs providing living wages and benefits) and whether these jobs improve health. 
We will ask three questions: 1) how are inclusive economic strategies implemented to improve health outcomes for diverse populations within the COVID-19 context? 2) how do these strategies affect health outcomes for diverse populations? 3) how has the pandemic affected workers' perspectives regarding employment and their health? We will use qualitative and quantitative methods (interviews, surveys, participant observation, document review). Data will be collected with two groups: 1) staff at EPE and partnering agencies and companies implementing inclusive economic strategies; and 2) diverse workers (e.g., newcomers, women, LGBTQQIP2SAA). Methods include following a cohort of diverse workers who have been hired, trained, and retained in good jobs to assess effects on health outcomes (stress, quality of life, self-rated health) over time. EPE and partnering agencies and companies will be involved in interpreting findings, which will be shared as actionable information about how economic systems can be transformed to respond to systemic inadequacies exposed by COVID-19."
Measuring muscle wasting in the elderly - an investigation of sarcopenia definitions and their associations with health outcomes and protein intake,"['Mayhew, Alexandra J']",['N/A'],"['Activities Of Daily Living', 'Disability', 'Muscle Mass', 'Muscle Strength', 'Physical Function', 'Protein Intake', 'Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve', 'Regression Analysis', 'Sarcopenia', 'Systematic Review']",,344788,"As people age, muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical function decrease. The term sarcopenia is used to describe this process. Sarcopenia is associated with poor health including disability, longer hospital stays, and mortality. Four sets of definitions for sarcopenia have been developed, each which includes different measures of muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical function. Depending on which definition is used, the prevalence of sarcopenia is between 1 and 39% of older adults suggesting that the definitions do not measure the same health condition. 

The primary goal of this project is to evaluate the current definitions of sarcopenia to determine which is most strongly associated with poor health. Different methods of measuring muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical function will be explored. The strength of the association between each definition and health outcomes such as disability measured through activities of daily living will be compared. Each definition also uses different cut off values for the muscle measures. The appropriateness of the cut-off values for the muscle measures for each definition will be assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves with health outcomes as the outcome. This analysis will be conducted using data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. Further analysis will be conducted to examine the relationship between protein consumption and the risk of sarcopenia.

The results of this research will contribute towards a harmonized definition of sarcopenia. Clinically, this will assist in physicians identifying people who should receive treatment or preventative care. For researchers, a harmonized definition would enable better comparisons between studies and from a population and public health perspective, more accurate estimates of the prevalence in sarcopenia will be possible. Receiver operating characteristic curves will be used"

Measures exist for assessing the HRQL impact of illnesses and conditions but these measures are not best suited for older persons who may have many such illnesses and conditions but who are still interested and involved in aging actively.  Some of the existing measures use many items to assess all the different illness aspects; others use very few items and capture only an illness snapshot.  Often the items are not relevant to the experience of older persons and some of the items ask the same content in different ways, something that many find confusing, if not annoying.  The intent here is to develop a brief measure of what matters to older persons as they attempt to get on with their life despite an illness burden.  This study will also use modern statistical and measurement approaches to create a scoring method that produces a value that considers the preferences for different combinations of health circumstances from the perspective of the older person: ""If I had to have that (pain) then I would also rather have this (many interesting distractions)"".  The gathering of evidence to support the interpretation of the scores across different groups of people (validation) will also be conducted through this project using a mix of in-person assessments and anonymous surveys using the internet. The methods proposed are consistent with the most up-to-date and rigorous guidelines for developing and testing measures and will result in a measure that can be used to evaluate seniors in their own communities."

Cervical precancer treatment can weaken the cervix and lead to complications in future pregnancies, such as preterm birth.  This is why we want to identify factors we could act on to reduce the number of women who are treatment unnecessarily. We will investigate the role of  pathology diagnosis on the biopsy, and investigate factors linked to spontaneous regression of the lesion between biopsy and treatment.  We will also look at the viral characteristics of the human papillomaviruses (the cause of cervical precancers) found in the cervical specimens. In another analysis, we will investigate if some patients and/or disease characteristics would help further define women truly at risk of recurrence of precancer after treatment.  We firmly believe that, in combination, those analyses will help balance benefits and harms from cervical cancer screening, by enabling more targeted intervention strategies."

HPV infections are very common. Most infections will disappear on their own, without any consequences.  However, some HR infections persist and can progress to cervical precancer and cancer.  
HPV tests can be used for cervical cancer screening in older women. HPV vaccines can prevent infections and related precancers and cancers.  Because the vaccines do not treat infections or disease that is already present, they are most effective if given before women begin having sex.
Older women remain at risk of acquiring infections throughout their lifetime and for this reason some experts have advocated that they should be vaccinated also. However, it is possible that infections acquired later in life do not carry the same risk of progressing to disease. Although up to now the few research efforts in older women have focused on the risk of infections. We believe research needs to focus on the risk of precancer, because infections are most often not problematic. 
To address this question, we will study a subgroup from a large cohort of women over 30 who have been diagnosed with an HPV infection and investigated for the presence of precancer.  We will determine the type of HPV causing the infection and verify if the risk of disease varies with age. This will help public health officials propose cervical cancer prevention strategies that are best suited for women of various ages."

Currently, there persists a paucity of empirical data on the coping mechanisms of persons of African Descent (PAD) and its impact on social determinants of health and access to MHSU services across their statuses (immigrants, African Nova Scotians etc) and socio-cultural-economic spheres.  
Considering that the negotiations PAD make in accessing MSHU services are likely to compromise such social determinants of health as employment, housing, and food for affected persons, it is crucial that effective policymaking aimed at understanding effective health standards should not be based on generalizations about the experiences and needs of target populations accessing MHSU services. There should be feedback on health care delivery and interventions from people with lived and living experiences of MHSU; with an attempt to ensure that health providers understand the experiences of service users of AD in navigating stigma and discrimination associated with MHSU. The proposed one-year project aims to situate the research within alternative research methods that project African knowledge and ways of healing/coping.
The study will be situated within Critical Race Theory, Postcoloniality and Afrocentricity and adopt a mixed-method for data collection that allow for Counter-StoryTelling styles entrenched in African traditional oral practices. A purposeful sampling method will be used to recruit 60 youths (18-25 years), 20-25 family members and care givers of AD resident in Nova Scotia across their intersecting biological and/or socio-cultural identities and 200 health service providers working with PAD accessing MHSU services in Canada."

Academic trainees will play an important role in the analysis and dissemination of this information for communities. The results will strengthen the programs and services to promote health among African Canadians, and to help strengthen advocacy and activism related to health and wellbeing among African Canadian communities, and ultimately to help African Canadian communities exercise power and control over their access to health services.  The research team will establish a community-based working group to ensure that the data are accessible to community stakeholders to support program development, advocacy and community engagement."
Enhancing Self-Management Support in Persons Newly Diagnosed with Dementia,"['McAiney, Carrie A', 'Dupuis, Sherry']","['Harvey, David', 'Heckman, George A', 'Le Clair, John K', 'Lee, Linda', 'Loiselle, Lisa', 'Rojas-Fernandez, Carlos', 'Wiersma, Elaine C']","['Dementia', 'Disease Management', 'Information Tool Kit', 'Knowledge Transfer', 'Primary Care', 'Self-Management']",155387.0,213504,"Illness self-management has been identified as a critical means of enabling persons with chronic illness to be partners with primary care providers by increasing their knowledge, skills and confidence in their ability to manage their condition. Despite a desire to be active partners in their care, self-management for persons with dementia has been largely ignored. The proposed study builds on existing work being conducted by the researchers where they have been working in partnership with persons with dementia, family members, family physicians and other health professionals in developing a resource kit to be given to persons with dementia and their family members at the time of diagnosis. The goals of the current project are to: 1) complete the development of a self-management education resource kit for persons living with dementia and their family members; 2) pilot test the resource kit to identify the range of potential impacts of the kit on persons with dementia and their family members; and 3) identify factors that help and hinder use of the resource kit in primary care and the community. In undertaking this proposed project, we will work with our existing PAR research team as well as Family Health Teams, Alzheimer Society First Link Coordinators, and community pharmacists to develop the remaining content for the kit and pilot test the kit. By providing individuals with information and support early in the disease, it can help to maintain the independence of the person with dementia, reduce the burdens associated with caregiving, and reduce costs to the health care system. The collaborative approach being used will help to ensure a self-management tool that is meaningful to persons with dementia and their family care partners, and feasible to implement in primary care and community settings."

Leveraging Longitudinal Data to Understand Youth Mental Health Care Utilization during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"['McArthur, Brae Anne']",['N/A'],"['Administrative Health Data', 'Covid-19', 'Developmental Psychopathology', 'Health Care Utilization', 'Longitudinal Cohort Study', 'Resilience Factors', 'Risk Factors', 'Trajectories', 'Youth Mental Health']",55000.0,454440,"The past year has been an extraordinarily challenging time for youth coping with ongoing changes and disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, stress, unpredictability, and disruptions can increase mental illness. Cross-sectional studies show that rates of youth anxiety and depression are on the rise during the COVID-19 pandemic. What is unknown is how these increased rates correspond to health service utilization. High-quality, contemporary data on how youth are coping with, and recovering from, the pandemic is crucial to inform the allocation of scarce mental health resources. Our study will provide this information. 

The All Our Families (AOF) study, an epidemiological prospective pregnancy cohort has followed 2400 families over time, and surveyed mothers and youth (now aged 9-11 years) three times during the pandemic. We now seek to examine the longitudinal trajectories of youth depression and anxiety prior to, during, and in the aftermath of the pandemic. We aim to link cohort data to administrative mental health data to identify the patterns of diagnoses and health service utilization among those at risk of elevated depression and anxiety, and to identify risk and protective factors that have amplified and/or attenuated mental distress over time. 

This study provides an exceptional opportunity to identify who becomes most at risk based on both the structural determinants of health and personal/familial factors. Identification of the patterns of stability and change in youth mental health due to the COVID-19 pandemic, along with service utilization, can help inform decisions on resource allocation and prevention and intervention strategies to optimize mental health for youth."
The association between social participation and health care utilization in older Manitoban adults.,"['McArthur, Jennifer M']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Health Behaviour', 'Health Services Use', 'Longitudinal Data', 'Older Adults', 'Social Determinants Of Health', 'Social Participation']",17500.0,252761,"Due to the aging population in Canada, it is becoming increasingly important for research to focus on older adult health. Recent studies have found that on average, older adults use more health services than any other age category. A factor found to hold a strong relationship with health services use in older adults is health behaviours such as physical activity. Social behaviours on the other hand, have not been examined as extensively in connection with health services use in older adults.

The purpose of this study is to look at the relationship between social participation and health services use in older adults. The data I will be using to assess this relationship will be from the WISER III study, collected in 2007/08. By looking at data from adults aged 45 years and older at the time of the study, I will be examining health services use among both baby boomers (i.e. future seniors) as well as current community-dwelling seniors.

Assessment of social participation will include measures of both formal (e.g., social groups) and informal (e.g., visiting with friends) social activities, as well as engagement in volunteer activities and social networks. Health services use will be assessed using administrative health care records obtained from the provincial health ministry, which is linked to the WISER III data. This includes information on actual health care use, such as hospital use, physician use, and pharmaceutical use, for the years 2000 to 2010. As such, this research will have an objective measure of health services use over a four-year period following the survey.

This research will be important in understanding the true importance of social participation in the health of older adults. Policy makers and planners will find this information valuable in the development of community level seniors programs and interventions to improve health in Canada's older adults."

The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated mental health stressors and concerns about campus suicides, already on the rise. In response, the BC Ministry of Mental Health and Addictions has funded the BC Campus Suicide Prevention Initiative (CSPI), partnering with the Canadian Mental Health Association, BC division (CMHA BC) who will distribute funding and offer technical support to all 25 BC publicly funded post-secondary institutions. This HSIF project will evaluate the implementation and early impacts of the CSPI, identify where further support is needed, and provide recommendations for how the public health system can ensure long-term and sustainable impacts and national scale-up to improve post-secondary suicide prevention and overall mental health and well-being. This study has the following aims: 1. to monitor early outcomes across the CSPI program's implementation; 2. to understand the mediating role of CMHA BC (program administrator and technical support coordinator) in the collaborative processes and outcomes of participating post-secondary institutions; and 3. to assess scalability and sustainability of the CSPI in BC and nationally. An evaluation-based multi-method approach will be used, to thoroughly identify how the CSPI works, for whom, and in what contexts - illustrated through CMO configurations (Contextual conditions, generative Mechanisms, and Outcomes). Qualitative stakeholder interviews, collection of project documents, and observing technical support sessions will inform creation and analysis of data. Ongoing analyses, used to build CMO configurations, will focus on understanding how CSPI implementation operates and with what effect. Findings will be leveraged to directly affect and optimize suicide prevention programs, policies, and resources locally, nationally and internationally."
Sustaining Knowledge Translation Within Indigenous Communities,"['McBeath, Brittany']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1300.0,382945,"European colonization of North America disrupted and suppressed the historically rich and diverse base of Indigenous knowledge and language. This included the systems for their exchange, and uptake to maintain and improve health within Indigenous communities (Smylie, 2011). Successful knowledge translation (KT) interventions within the context of Indigenous communities are most successful when they take the form of interpersonal exchange (Leadbeater, Banister, & Marshall, 2011). Currently, sustaining knowledge use following a KT intervention can be a challenge, yet this phase of the KT process remains understudied (Graham et al., 2006). The objective of my research is to identify barriers and facilitators to KT intervention sustainability within the socio-ecological system of an Indigenous community. Specifically, I intend to focus on my home community, Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory as a case study because this community will be receiving an Indigenous-led week-ling mobilization training workshop focused on diabetes prevention (i.e., the KT intervention). I intend to conduct qualitative interviews informed by Indigenous KT with workshop participants, addressing each layer of the social ecological system as informed by an Indigenous KT lens. My research is ancillary to the a larger Community Mobilization Training research led by my graduate supervisor, Dr. Lucie Lévesque, which builds upon established partnerships with several Indigenous communities across Canada. Parallel to the approach of the larger project, my research will be participatory, with all phases of research completed in partnership with the community. The end product of dissemination will be a culturally relevant resource to support the sustainment of the KT intervention created by, with, and for the community."

To date, few youth have been involved in the CMT, yet it has been widely documented that youth are essential partners in community mobilization, and that community mobilization can provide developmental opportunities for the youth.

Purpose
My doctoral research aims to 1) gain a better understanding of Indigenous youth's conceptualization of health and wellness in their community, 2) to facilitate positive youth development opportunities through youth-led participatory evaluation and advocacy, and 3) to increase uptake of the larger KSDPP CMT project within the community of Tyendinaga by involving the youth in the process of community mobilization.

Methods
The three studies done within this project will follow a rubric for participatory practice outlined by (Ledwith & Springett, 2010) which includes three interlinked components of storytelling, respectful dialogue, and reflexivity. Research design, methods, analysis and dissemination of the storytelling, and dialogue components will rely heavily on consultation with the youth at Quinte Mohawk School.

Strengths-Based Community-Driven Frameworks of Wellness Developed by Diverse Indigenous Communities,"['McBeath, Brittany']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2800.0,412169,"Participants of the Kahnawake Schools Diabetes Prevention Project (KSDPP) Community Mobilization Training (CMT) for Diabetes Prevention were invited to take part in a talking circle that was focused on how participants from each community defined wellness. It is well known, and well documented that Indigenous conceptualizations of wellness differ from Western conceptualizations, yet Western measures are still being used within Indigenous communities to quantify health and wellness. 
By exploring and creating a unique framework of wellness driven by the members of each community completing the KSDPP CMT, using the method of concept mapping, this activity will provide a basis for strategic planning related to further community mobilization efforts, and also evaluation of efforts to improve wellness in their community along the way. The concept map is created based on how participants sort statements about wellness into themes and rate statements about wellness according to its importance and the possibility of achieving it. With this information communities will be able to create their own tools to quantify their community health and wellness. In the past, information from concept maps have also been used to advocate for policy change, and additional funding."
Evaluating the impacts of end-demand criminalization and immigration policies on the health access and human rights of im/migrant women in sex work,"['McBride, Bronwyn G']",['N/A'],"['Epidemiology', 'Gender', 'Immigrant Health', 'Sex Work', 'Social Inequities', ""Women'S Health""]",105000.0,404130,"Despite evidence that criminalization promotes stigma, violence, HIV/STI burden and labour rights violations among sex workers, in 2014 Canada enacted end-demand sex work legislation (Protection of Exploited Communities and Persons Act, PCEPA) which upholds the criminalization of clients and third party activities while leaving the sale of sex legal. However, selling sex services remains explicitly criminalized for temporary residents and open work permit holders: this additional criminalization may compound documented health and labour inequities among im/migrant workers. Evidence suggests most im/migrant sex workers in Canada are legal immigrants; yet face unique vulnerabilities including racism, stigma, and language barriers resulting in poor healthcare access. Qualitative research suggests im/migrant sex workers may fear jeopardizing their legal status (i.e., work permit) as a result of police interactions, which has been shown to impede reporting violence to authorities and limit health access through fear of disclosing sex work to health providers. Authorities' broad discretion in enforcing sex work and immigration laws, and the conflation of sex work (consensual exchange of sex services) and sex trafficking (forced sexual labour) among racialized women may exacerbate barriers to healthcare and legal protections. Given that punitive PCEPA and immigration enforcement may disproportionately impact im/migrant sex workers, there is an urgent need to assess how such criminalization impacts their health and human rights. As policy shifts impacting im/migrant sex workers in Canada have occurred despite a dearth of evidence on their experiences, and given the PCEPA's stated goal of protecting vulnerable communities, I will evaluate how shifts in criminalized interactions post-PCEPA relate to im/migrant sex workers' health access and human rights to inform national and global policy discussions on end-demand legislation."
Identifying Barriers to HIV Testing on Fort McKay Reserve in Northern Alberta,"['Mcbride, Katharine']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal Health', 'Community Health', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Hiv/Aids Testing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Risk Taking Behaviour']",35000.0,264399,"This project will explore barriers to HIV testing on the Fort McKay First Nation reserve. Fort McKay is a reserve that is 60 km from the nearest town and over 500 km from HIV specialists or services. During my time doing health outreach with street entrenched people of nearby Fort McMurray I found that many of them were from Fort McKay. Though these individuals knew they were at risk for HIV due to high risk behaviors they still chose not the get tested. Now that I am working in Fort McKay I would like to explore the topic of HIV testing on the reserve.

Throughout Canadian HIV epidemiological data, researchers are quick to point out that Canadian aboriginals are over represented in the infected population. Testing is an essential component of HIV prevention. Awareness of status substantially affects sexual behavior by decreasing risk-taking and can therefore prevent new infections. Regardless, the information health professionals have on HIV testing within First Nations communities is limited.

This project will focus on the experiences of Fort McKay First Nation surrounding HIV testing; I would like to create a narrative of barriers to testing within the community. The target population will be community members who have, are at risk for, or have been affected by HIV. This study will be carried out using qualitative interviews and two discussion groups. 

This project will provide the Fort McKay First Nation health center with a clearer picture of barriers to HIV testing within the community. The findings will also be shared with Chief and Council and can be integrated into community wide health initiatives."
A US national causal analysis of the impacts of wildfire smoke and disaster on preterm birth and infant mortality,"['McBrien, Heather']",['N/A'],"['Air Pollution', 'Causal Inference', 'Climate Change', 'Disasters And Health', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Environmental Health', 'Infant Mortality', 'Perinatal Epidemiology', 'Preterm Birth', 'Wildfire']",105000.0,474147,"Wildfires are widespread in Canada, the United States, and globally, and will become more frequent, intense, and destructive with climate change. 70% of the US population is exposed to wildfire smoke each year. At the same time, people caught in wildfire disasters experience evacuation, fear, disruption of social networks, and financial strain. Both wildfire-generated fine particulate matter (PM2.5), a pernicious air pollutant, and exposure to a wildfire disaster may cause a neonate to be born early or an infant to die.
Most studies about wildfire and health focus on smoke. Few evaluate early birth or infant death, or consider environmental justice. Some people may be more vulnerable to wildfire, like those who live in housing that lets in smoke, or babies and parents who are sick already. We propose a study spanning years 2000-2017 using three US national datasets: one including all wildfire disasters, another cataloguing wildfire PM2.5 concentrations, and a third cataloguing all births and infant deaths. We assembled the disaster dataset based on available wildfire and federal emergency declarations. We used ground-level air pollution concentrations and satellite images to create estimated wildfire PM2.5 levels. Together with vital statistics data, we can measure disaster and wildfire PM2.5¬ exposure during pregnancy and after birth. We aim to: (1) evaluate the effects of disaster exposure and exposure to wildfire PM2.5 on the risk of early birth and infant death; and (2) examine these relationships in subgroups who may be more vulnerable.
Wildfire seasons will continue to worsen in North America. The proposed work considers smoke and disaster exposure during vulnerable life stages. This contributes to environmental justice goals by identifying those most at risk of health effects from wildfire. To achieve disaster resiliency, we must identify individuals and areas that are at higher risk, so we can intervene to protect population health."
A persisting presence: Using natural language processing methods to identify previously uncaptured and mild cases of pertussis in the Electronic Medical Record Administrative data Linked Database (EMRALD) to assess how waning immunity from the acellular vaccine contributes to the existence of mild cases in Ontario and to understand the role of these cases in sustaining community disease transmission,"['McBurney, Shilo H']",['N/A'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Epidemiology', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Immunization Research', 'Infectious Disease', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Pertussis', 'Population Health', 'Public Health']",105000.0,408174,"Pertussis (whooping cough) is a serious health concern that can lead to death, particularly in infants. Pertussis is preventable through vaccination, but in recent years the number of cases has been increasing. The estimated number of pertussis cases worldwide in 2014 was 24.1 million with 160, 700 deaths. In Canada, a large-scale outbreak of pertussis last occurred in 2015, with 700 cases reported in Ontario alone. However, the number of actual cases is suspected to be much higher than the reported number. A recent study estimated that up to 98% of pertussis cases go unreported in Ontario. It is essential to have correct counts of pertussis cases to guide vaccination policy and programmes. Of particular concern are mild cases of pertussis which do not have typical symptoms and as a result are difficult to correctly diagnose. It is believed that these cases may be sustaining the spread of disease in communities as they remain undetected and able to transmit infection to other people. The existence of milder cases could be due to using the acellular pertussis vaccine, which has been demonstrated to become ineffective faster than the whole-cell vaccine. It is of great importance to public health to correctly estimate the number of pertussis cases in Ontario, including mild cases. This study aims to apply artificial intelligence methods to electronic medical record and health administrative data to accomplish this goal. Additionally, statistical analyses will be used to identify reasons for the existence of mild cases, such as acellular vaccine use, and determine their role in transmitting disease. Such information will support public health agencies in making necessary changes to vaccination programmes by identifying key populations to target with boosters or whole-cell vaccines. This would greatly assist in reducing the number of pertussis cases and deaths in Ontario and could be used more broadly to set an example for vaccination policy elsewhere in Canada."
Perfectionism and Implicit Self-Esteem: Important Factors in the Experience of Anxiety and Depression,"['McCabe-Bennett, Hanna I']",['N/A'],"['Anxiety', 'Depression', 'Implicit Self-Esteem', 'Negative Feedback', 'Perfectionism', 'Positive Feedback']",17500.0,254093,"Anxiety and depression are serious mental health issues with harmful physical consequences. They both tend to affect the lives of women more often than those of men. Two personality traits that play a role in the experience of anxiety and depression are perfectionism and implicit self-esteem. There are two types of perfectionism. Those with maladaptive perfectionism require reassurance from others to diminish their feelings of anxiety and depression, whereas those with adaptive perfectionism do not. Implicit self-esteem refers to automatic associations with the self ranging from positive to negative, or high to low implicit self-esteem. Individuals with low implicit self-esteem tend to experience worse moods after receiving negative feedback from others than those with high implicit self-esteem. Currently, it is unclear how these two traits function together in the experience of anxiety and depression. The present program of research seeks to demonstrate that by considering perfectionism and implicit self-esteem together, we will be better able to understand the causes of anxiety and depression. Undergraduate students who are high in either maladaptive or adaptive perfectionism will participate in the study. All participants will complete a computerized test of implicit self-esteem. They will then receive either positive or negative feedback about their performance on a mock test of scholastic or social competence, followed by measures of anxiety and depression. We predict that participants high in maladaptive perfectionism with low implicit self-esteem and receiving negative feedback will likely feel the most anxiety and depression in both the scholastic and social domains. The findings from this research will help mental health professionals identify people at risk for anxiety and depression while encouraging the development of comprehensive approaches to treatment for these patients, consequently improving their personal mental and physical health."

The Crosstown Clinic remains the only site in Canada to engage in such treatment. While the efficacy and cost-effectiveness have been demonstrated, little is known about the experiences of patients and staff within the program. In this interpretive descriptive study I will investigate the clinical phenomenon of heroin assisted treatment by identifying themes that are based on subjective interpretations of experiences. Thematic analysis can assist in identifying common themes and patterns and relies on processes of constant comparison to developed insights into human experiences. It is important to always keep the aim of the research in mind and to contribute in ways that speak to a) what can be learned about the phenomenon and b) how does this knowledge shape practice. The goals of this study are to better understand the experiences of people who seek treatment for severe and refractory heroin dependency, to inform the practice of everyday practitioners, and to help policy makers create programs that ensure access to and retention in treatment."

Prenatal exposure to environmental contaminants and fetal growth: How to account for multiplicity when testing multiple statistical hypotheses?,"['McCandless, Lawrence', 'Lanphear, Bruce P']","['Kosatsky, Tom', 'Phipps, Erica', 'Bornn, Luke', 'Braun, Joseph', 'Moodie, Erica E', 'Rempel, Emily S', 'Steele, Russell J', 'Stephens, David A', 'Venners, Scott', 'Woods, Meghan']","['Bayesian Statistics', 'Biostatistics', 'Epidemiology', 'Fetal Growth', 'Multiple Comparisons']",12500.0,324982,"In perinatal epidemiology, we often measure multiple correlated exposure variables in study participants, such as biomarkers during pregnancy.  These variables permit testing of novel exposure-disease relationships.  However, multiple testing also leads to more false positives (due to type 1 error).  The extent of this multiplicity is usually non-transparent, and there is extensive debate in the literature on whether it should be adjusted for in the analysis. The problem of multiplicity can be eliminated when viewed from a hierarchical Bayesian perspective. Multilevel models shift point estimates and their corresponding 95% intervals towards each other by a process called ""shrinkage"".

The goal of this Planning and Dissemination Grant is to support planning activities and bring together stakeholders including Bayesian statisticians, child health researchers, epidemiologists, trainees and decision makers.  We will (1) exchange knowledge on current practices, gaps and priorities to adjust for multiplicity when testing hypotheses from correlated exposure variables in perinatal epidemiology, and (2) apply this knowledge to establish a research agenda for developing novel Bayesian statistical methods and tools.  This grant application will employ the HOME (Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment) Study, led by Bruce Lanphear, which examines the effect of mixtures of environmental contaminants on healthy growth and development in a cohort of mothers and their infants. 

The planning activities will have two tangible outcomes.  The first outcome will be a consensus about research priorities, which will take the form of a grant proposal to be submitted to the CIHR Project Scheme in March 2016.  The second outcome will be a summary report to be published in an open-access journal, which details current practices and priorities faced by perinatal epidemiologists who adjust for multiplicity when analyzing correlated biomarker data."
Biostatistical methods for estimating the cumulative impact of environmental contaminant exposures on preterm birth,"['McCandless, Lawrence', 'Lanphear, Bruce P']","['Braun, Joseph', 'Fraser, William D', 'Moodie, Erica E', 'Platt, Robert W', 'Stephens, David A', 'Woods, Meghan']","['Biostatistics', 'Environmental Contaminants', 'Environmental Influences On Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Machine Learning', 'Pregnancy Outcomes', 'Preterm Birth']",198330.0,351120,"The causes of many preterm births are unknown.  A growing body of research points to the role of environmental contaminant exposures during pregnancy as a possible cause of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth.  Of particular concern is cumulative exposure to multiple contaminants.  While each contaminant may shorten pregnancy by only a few days, the cumulative impact of many contaminants may be substantial.  The interest in environmental factors that influence pregnancy outcomes has arisen in tandem with new and important birth cohort studies in Canada and beyond.  However, analyzing biomarkers in birth cohort studies presents extraordinary challenges to biostatistical research.  Numerous methods have been proposed for modelling cumulative exposures including Bayesian methods and machine learning techniques.  However, the differences between methods are not well understood by stakeholders in terms of ability to obtain better estimates with less bias and higher precision.  The overall goal of this project is to estimate the effect of environmental contaminant exposures during pregnancy on preterm birth using data from the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study and the Health Outcome and Measures of the Environment (HOME) Study.  Additionally, we will develop and investigate novel biostatistical methods for estimating the health effects of cumulative exposures.  This grant submission builds on an emerging Canadian collaboration between the disciplines of biostatistics and reproductive health epidemiology, with input from knowledge users and trainees.  We will develop state-of-the-art biostatistical methods to obtain better evidence that improves our understanding of the environmental causes and mechanistic pathways leading to preterm birth."

"HIV risk and self-identified healthcare priorities of ""high risk"" young women in Ukraine and Kenya","['Mcclarty, Leigh M']",['N/A'],"['Global Public Health', 'Hiv Prevention', 'Kenya', 'Public Health Programming', 'Sex Work', 'Sexual Health', 'Ukraine']",105000.0,327842,"Existing models of targeted HIV prevention interventions (TI) are successful in providing health services to older/well-established female sex workers (FSW), but often miss young women who are new to sex work (SW) or engaging in transactional sex (TS), but do not self-identify as FSW. Thus, many women involved in SW are already HIV+ before accessing health services. It is necessary to tailor TI to reach and meet the sexual health needs of young women prior to and immediately following self-identification as FSW.

In order to improve TI accessibility and acceptability for these ""high risk"" young women, it will be critical to better understand their personal healthcare priorities and how these priorities might affect HIV risk/vulnerability during these periods. Little research specifically explores the healthcare priorities of young women newly practicing SW or those engaging in TS. While HIV is likely a concern for these women, it may not be a specific healthcare priority. This study intends to address this gap. My proposal focuses on ""high risk"" young women in Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine and Mombasa, Kenya. Ukraine's relatively new HIV epidemic is concentrated among FSW - who are 10-times more likely to be HIV+ than women in the general population - but is rapidly expanding. In Kenya, the HIV epidemic is stable and generalised with average adult prevalence of 6%, but is also significantly concentrated among FSW, who are burdened by nearly 30% prevalence.

This study will significantly contribute to an important yet poorly understood area in HIV prevention. Using knowledge of women's healthcare priorities to inform TI design is an innovative approach to further tailor HIV prevention efforts specifically for ""high risk"" young women. Findings from this work can be used to inform policy and TI design, while beginning to understand HIV prevention strategies that meet the unique needs of young women involved in commercial SW and TS."
HIV positive solvent users: a volatile combination,"['Mcclarty, Leigh M']",['N/A'],"['Anti-Retroviral Therapy', 'Disease Progression', 'Hiv', 'Patterns Of Care', 'Questionnaire', 'Retrospective Chart Review', 'Solvent Abuse']",17500.0,224424,"Solvent inhalation is a form of substance abuse that has been prevalent in marginalised and vulnerable populations worldwide for a number of years, though it still receives very little attention from both the public and research communities. Previous research indicates that solvent users are at substantially increased risk for HIV infection, with evidence of prevalence among users being approximately two times greater than among non-users. Their addictions, in addition to their compromised immune system, make HIV positive solvent users a particularly vulnerable population. 
This study will examine the effects solvent addictions have on disease progression in HIV positive individuals and the efficacy of anti-retroviral drug therapy in these patients. In addition, focus will be put on developing novel strategies to ensure adequate and accessible services for all persons living with HIV, and specifically for solvent users. 
As limited research exists on solvent abuse in general, information obtained from this investigation may be found to be particularly important in identifying specific risks involved with using solvents while infected with HIV. The application of the knowledge acquired throughout this study will be especially useful for the Manitoba HIV Program, as we do believe the population of HIV positive solvent users in the program is quite unique.
We hope this study will be able to provide a platform for further research on the impact of solvent use on HIV positive individuals. If any sort of correlation were to be found between the use of solvents and severity of HIV infection, it would be of great interest to identify the specific reasons behind the phenomenon. Furthermore, understanding the effects of solvent use on HIV positive individuals could open doors for further investigation into the roles other illicit drugs play in disease progression drug treatment efficiency in people living with HIV/AIDS."

Program Science is an equity-centric approach for embedding research and learning into public health programs so that the research process is directly linked to and addressing issues and challenges that limit the positive impact that public health programs have on the health and wellbeing of marginalized communities at most risk for HIV/STBBI. To successfully operationalize a Program Science approach, long-term partnerships between researchers, community members, public health program implementers, and government are essential. To foster these critical Program Science partnerships, we are proposing to hold a two-day meeting to bring together new and existing research, policy, and implementation partners, with the goal of strengthening and expanding authentic Program Science partnerships to advance embedded Program Science research agendas that will inform the optimization of HIV/STBBI programming for affected marginalized populations in Nigeria and Kenya. The meeting will focus on sharing Program Science research findings from across Sub-Saharan Africa, expanding our Program Science networks within Canada's global health research community, and identifying opportunities to strengthen embedded research initiatives in Nigeria and Kenya. Ultimately, the goal of this work is to leverage new and existing Program Science partnerships to develop effective strategies for optimizing HIV/STBBI programs to improve equity and health outcomes for people living with and at increased risk of acquiring HIV/STBBI."
Criminal charges of HIV non-disclosure: impacts on the lives of people living with HIV and AIDS,"['Mcclelland, Alexander L']",['N/A'],"['Community-Based Research', 'Health And Criminal Law', 'Hiv Non-Disclosure And Criminal Law', 'Hiv-Related Stigma And Discrimination', 'In-Depth Semi-Structured Interviews', 'Intersectional Analysis Of Hiv', 'Qualitative Health Research', 'Social Determinants Of Health']",99167.0,279107,"In Canada, HIV positive people are increasingly charged criminally for not telling their HIV status to sexual partners. This is known as the criminalization of HIV non-disclosure. There is no evidence that this helps prevent the spread of HIV. In fact, people with HIV have been imprisoned even when they have used condoms or when there has been no HIV transmission. This punitive climate is driving people away from proven HIV prevention and support services. HIV is not what it once was. Treatments for HIV have dramatically improved quality of life and have made HIV very hard to transmit. But still today, HIV is a highly stigmatized disease. Telling people your HIV-positive status can result in discrimination and violence. Experts state that the complexities underlying HIV disclosure and prevention are not suited to a criminal law context. The recent Supreme Court of Canada decision reinforced a legal approach on this issue and has opened the door for further charges. Up until 2010 there have been 122 cases, with charges ranging from sexual assault to attempted murder. This project will ask the question: How has the experience of being charged in relation to HIV non-disclosure impacted peoples lives, and what are the implications for human rights and the HIV response? This Community Based Research project will interview up to 20 people who have been charged in relation to not disclosing their HIV status. Interview participants will include men and women from across Canada. This project will be conducted in partnership with Concordia University, Ontario Working Group on Criminal Law and HIV Exposure, Prisoners AIDS Support Action Network, and the HIV and AIDS Legal Clinic Ontario. There has been no study of the experiences of people in Canada who faced these charges firsthand. This research will offer new insight to help understand the personal, social and human rights implications of this practice to help inform responses and alternatives."

The project seeks to better understand the individual, community, social and structural level factors that enable resiliency and healthy decision making among young people living with HIV in the context of significant HIV related stigma.  HIV related stigma has significant and adverse effects on the health, quality of life, well being and social support of young people living with HIV. The realities and fears of HIV related stigma are felt intensely by young people living with HIV. HIV related stigma has also been shown to impact access to services and adherence to antiretroviral therapy among young people living with HIV, as well as affecting self esteem and depression levels. Better understanding how young people living with HIV respond to unique challenges and various forms of HIV related stigma can assist in the development of relevant and effective interventions to address these factors. Using an asset based, resiliency approach, a modified form of 'body mapping' methodology will be used to engage youth in identifying individual, community and institutional assets that enable resiliency in the face of HIV related stigma. Body mapping is a process whereby people living with HIV are facilitated through a creative process of tracing, drawing and painting to depict pictures relating to their health, their history, their points of personal power, and their life goals. Each resulting map tells a unique story that illustrates the impact of HIV on the body and the soul. Research outcomes will inform ongoing program development at PYO and other programs working with young people living with HIV."
Explanatory Models of Cancer-Anorexia-Cachexia Syndrome: Family Members' Perspectives,"['Mcclement, Susan E']","['Chochinov, Harvey M', 'Hack, Thomas F', 'Harlos, Michael S', 'Lobchuk, Michelle M', 'Thompson, Genevieve N']","['Cancer Anorexia Cachexia', 'Explanatory Models Of Illness', 'Family Caregivers', 'Palliative Care', 'Psychosocial', 'Social Sciences']",113859.0,292116,"Lack of appetite (anorexia) and profound weight loss (cachexia)are common among advanced cancer patients. These symptoms can be very distressing for family members who sometimes respond by trying to force feed patients. In contrast, clinicians typically do not endorse aggressive nutritional intervention for anorexia and cachexia, opting instead to let patients decide what, when, and how much to eat. Some family members equate clinicians' non-aggressive response to these symptoms as tantamount to nutritional neglect of the patient. Not surprisingly, nutritional care issues at the end of life are a common source of tension and conflict in the relationship families have with clinicians. In order to work effectively with families around nutritional care issues, clinicians must first understand why family members believe anorexia and cachexia are occurring, and what constitutes an appropriate therapeutic response. This understanding is referred to as an explanatory model, and provides a framework for explaining why people respond in the ways that they do when making sense of illness. The explanatory model that informs clinicians' understanding of, and thus responses to anorexia and cachexia are found in biomedical literature. However, no research has been conducted explicating family members' explanatory models of these symptoms. We hypothesize that the tension and conflict that occurs between family members and clinicians about how to manage anorexia and cachexia is a function of divergent explanatory models. In order to work effectively with family members, clinicians must first understand the explanatory models that families hold. We propose to interview fifty family members of terminal cancer patients to explicate their explanatory models. Such understanding will provide the foundation from which meaningful educational and psychosocial interventions for families can
be developed and tested, thereby improving the care of family members of the terminally ill."

Colonial definitions of homelessness do not consider Indigenous perspectives and understandings of homelessness and therefore likely underestimates homelessness in urban Indigenous communities and its' impact on connection to self, culture, and community and use of drugs and alcohol. 

To address this, I will work in partnership with Indigenous community partners to develop and pilot a series of Our Health Counts (OHC) Winnipeg survey questions that measure an Indigenous definition and understanding of homelessness. I will conduct a secondary data analysis on respondent-driven sampling OHC Winnipeg data to understand Indigenous homelessness and its' impacts on connection to culture and use of drugs and alcohol in an urban Indigenous population in Winnipeg.

An indicator that measures Indigenous homelessness will provide a quantitative 'evidence-base' for the many direct and indirect structural and social factors that contribute to homelessness among Indigenous peoples. The information generated from this research is important to understand Indigenous homelessness in an appropriate context that will inform the current gaps in urban Indigenous social and health services dedicated to supporting Indigenous peoples experiencing homelessness."

These experiences are often traumatic and paramedics are at an increased risk of developing work-related mental illnesses, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, and anxiety. Tragically, suicide rates among paramedics are also high. Despite an increasing awareness of this crisis facing the paramedic community, the scope of the problem, its root causes, and ways to improve the mental health of paramedics remain poorly understood. To better understand these issues, our team will undertake a comprehensive study of paramedic mental health, with particular attention to exploring how the sociocultural features of paramedic work - the shared values, attitudes, and beliefs associated with the profession - influence paramedics' mental health and wellbeing. Our research will involve distributing a comprehensive written survey to all paramedics in a large, urban emergency medical service in Ontario. This will allow us to obtain more accurate estimates of how common work-related mental illness is among paramedics, and what individual or organizational factors might increase the risk of developing a work-related mental illness. We will also conduct in-depth interviews with individual paramedics to better understand how the professional culture of paramedicine - what it means to be a paramedic - affects their mental health and wellbeing. Taken together, our study will provide a more holistic understanding of how common work-related mental illness is among paramedics, what risk factors exist, and how to create workplaces that support their mental health and wellbeing. This will help mental health workers better understand the unique issues and challenges faced by paramedics and lead to more effective prevention and treatment strategies."

Studies have found positive associations between walkability and physical activity, and in particular recreational and transportation walking. Despite promising findings, most studies to date have estimated associations between walkability and walking from cross-sectional data. Cross-sectional data however, cannot provide causal evidence regarding the temporal direction of associations. Thus, based on current evidence it is difficult to determine if the estimated associations reflect higher walkability causing more physical activity or if the estimated associations just reflect the non-random process of already physically active adults seeking out neighbourhoods that have high levels of walkability (i.e., residential self-selection). Longitudinal residential relocation studies (a type of natural experiment) can provide causal evidence regarding the temporal direction of associations between the built environment and physical activity. We will use existing longitudinal data (n=10,330) collected from a random cross-section of Albertan adults (35-69 years) to investigate the extent to which changes in objectively-determined walkability are associated with changes in transportation and recreational walking following residential relocation. Evidence from this study will provide causal evidence that will be useful for urban form and transportation planners and policymakers in creating walkable neighbourhoods in Canada and elsewhere."

Findings from previous studies suggest that urban planning policies that inform the design of the neighbourhood built environment are associated with physical activity behaviour. These previous findings have had, for the most part, a positive impact on current urban planning policy and practice however, these studies have several major methodological issues, one of which includes the over-reliance on cross-sectional designs that do not allow the temporal direction of associations between the built environment and physical activity to be established. These studies have also typically relied on self-reported measures of physical activity that can over-estimate physical activity levels. Moreover, there is a lack of evidence on the economic value of creating physical activity-supportive neighbourhood environments. 

Building on my previous research, I will lead a research program that will deliver rigorous causal and economic evidence in a form that can be used by policymakers to create better built environments that support health for all individuals regardless of their socioeconomic circumstances or life-stage. This 5-year research program will: 1) Characterize the relations between neighbourhood design and physical activity, and; 2) Generate evidence on the economic value of neighbourhood design to inform physical activity-supportive urban policies.

Discrepancies between individuals' perceptions of their neighbourhoods and the actual built environment can influence their physical activity choices. Our study will investigate the relationships between perceived walkability, actual walkability, and physical activity. Additionally, this research will pay particular attention to specific subpopulations, including older adults, women, racialized minorities, immigrants, and those of lower socioeconomic status. Our study aligns with broader national priorities focused on creating healthier and more equitable urban environments.

Approach: Our secondary analysis will utilize data from two comprehensive and nationally representative databases: the Canadian Health Measures Survey and the Canadian Active Living Index. These databases offer varied and relevant information, such as sociodemographic characteristics, self-reported physical activity, and neighbourhood attributes, pertinent to our study's objectives. Our sample will include data from over 16,000 household interviews and approximately 4,700 health and fitness assessments, with physical activity measurements obtained through wearable accelerometers. Applying an in-depth and rigorous statistical analysis strategy, we aim to reveal how people's perceptions of their neighbourhood built environment might either amplify or counteract the influence of actual neighbourhood built characteristics on physical activity, including self-reported recreational and transportation physical activity and accelerometer-determined moderate-to-vigorous physical activity and steps. 

Implications: Insights from this study hold potential to shape context and population-specific public health strategies and urban design initiatives geared toward enhancing physical activity and improving population health."
Efficacy of limb immersion for mitigating physiological strain from the cell to whole-body response during a daylong heat exposure in elderly adults: a laboratory-based heat wave simulation,"['McCormick, James J']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Body Temperature', 'Cardiovascular Function', 'Cellular Stress', 'Extreme Heat Events', 'Heat Mitigation Strategies', 'Heat Stress']",45000.0,473796,"On the heels of the hottest decade ever recorded in Canada, Canadians faced record-setting summer heat in 2021, engulfing Western Canada and claiming the lives of vulnerable elderly adults. We recently showed that the brief use of air conditioning midday during a heat wave can alleviate elevations in body temperature and reduce cardiovascular strain in elderly adults, although these benefits were short-lived upon returning to the heat. However, this brief period of cooling was able to preserve vital cellular function even upon re-entry to the heat, that could otherwise lead to heat-related injury or death. However, many Canadians do not have access to air conditioning or are unable to access cooled locations (i.e., those in retirement or care homes), leading health agencies including the World Health Organization and Health Canada to recommend, simple alternative methods of cooling the body that can be performed at home. This includes the use of limb cooling, wherein the legs are immersed in cool water during indoor overheating, however little evidence exists evaluating the effectiveness of limb cooling on protecting the body during exposure to heat. To address this knowledge gap, my project aims to assess the efficacy of limb immersion in preventing dangerous elevations in body temperature, diminished cardiovascular function, and impaired cellular activity in elderly adults during daylong exposure to heat representative of indoor conditions faced by Canadians during the 2021 heat wave. This includes assessing whether the benefits of immersing the limbs in cool water intermittently throughout the day provide more protection than only during the latter half of a heat wave simulation, when a person is likely the hottest. By evaluating simple limb immersion for mitigating the harmful effects of extreme heat, this work will contribute to the development of evidence-based and sex-specific heat protection strategies to improve health outcomes in elderly men and women."
Long-term health resource utilization and total economic burden following diagnosis of Systemic Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases: a population-based study,"['McCormick, Natalie']",['N/A'],"['Connective Tissue Disorders', 'Direct Medical Costs', 'Health Economics', 'Indirect Costs', 'Longitudinal Analysis', 'Population-Based Cohort', 'Productivity Costs', 'Provincial Administrative Data', 'Systemic Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases', 'Systemic Vasculitis']",105000.0,307772,"SARDs are a group of inflammatory arthritis disorders (including lupus) affecting muscles, joints, and nearly every body system. Life span and quality are reduced by serious damage to the lungs, brain, heart, blood vessels and kidneys that frequently occurs, and the toxic effects of their immunosuppressive therapies. Thus, SARDs are believed quite costly to the healthcare system, but the long-term costs of these chronic disorders, and what influences them, are not well known. We will access 16 years of anonymous medical claims (including outpatient visits & tests, hospitalizations, and all prescriptions) for all adult SARD patients in BC, no matter where they live, to calculate their medical costs over time. To determine the extra healthcare costs from SARDs, we will compare these costs to those for a similar group of BC residents without SARDs. The physical manifestations of SARDs mean patients frequently are limited in their ability to participate in childcare, domestic activities and paid work during their prime reproductive and career years. In fact, many SARD patients become unable to work within 2 years of diagnosis, barring further career advancement and eliminating a source of retirement savings, extended health benefits, socialization and self-esteem. The financial implications for patients, families and the entire Canadian economy are huge, but underappreciated, and what drives these costs is unknown. We will directly survey a sample of the same BC SARD patients about their quality-of-life, and time they are less, or completely unable, to work or perform other activities, and link this data to their health claims data to quantify the total economic burden of SARDs. Our estimates should raise the profile of SARDs in Canada and help policymakers allocate scarce government resources to deliver care more efficiently and make informed decisions about new therapies, to reduce costs, keep patients working, and help preserve their health and quality-of-life"
"Prospective, population-based studies of antimalarials and their impact on vision loss, quality-of-life, disease activity, and mortality in patients with rheumatic disease","['McCormick, Natalie']",['N/A'],"['Anti-Malarials', 'Causal Framework Analyses', 'Electronic Medical Records', 'Hydroxychloroquine', 'Marginal Structural Models', 'Mortality', 'Patient-Reported Outcomes', 'Retinopathy', 'Rheumatoid Arthritis', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus']",150000.0,376668,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and lupus are forms of inflammatory arthritis that affect at least 1 of every 100 Canadians, mainly females. Immune dysfunction leads to organ and joint damage, disability, work loss, pain, fatigue and early mortality. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an anti-malarial drug, is also a long-term treatment for lupus and RA that improves survival. Though effective, low cost, and generally safe, one serious adverse effect of HCQ is irreversible retinopathy (damage to the back of the eye) that can lead to vision loss and blindness.

Retinopathy was thought to be rare (<2% of long-term HCQ users), but in a recent study using more sensitive screening tests, many more were affected (7.5%). As a result, guidelines now call for HCQ users to have these new, more sensitive eye tests every year, to diagnose it earlier. But much is unknown about the risk of retinopathy, risk factors, and impact of earlier diagnosis on patients' vision, survival and quality-of-life. For example, detecting more cases of mild retinopathy (which may not progress) could simply increase patients' anxiety.

To fill these gaps, we will use electronic healthcare data (without names or identifying information) to follow ~3,000 people with lupus and RA who have used HCQ for at least 5 years. We will use new statistical methods to estimate of the risk of retinopathy (overall, and with HCQ different doses), and risk factors, which may include female sex, increased age, kidney disease, and using higher doses of HCQ. We will also study its progression over time - we expect severe cases of retinopathy will progress to vision loss, but milder cases will not. 

Finally, we will also see what happens when patients stop HCQ, or reduce the dose. While that may help prevent vision loss, risk of death may increase alongside. 

Our findings will help clinicians and patients make more informed treatment decisions to reduce their chances of vision loss, while optimising their survival and quality-of-life"

By providing trainees with mentorship opportunities to learn about traditional healing we believe that we are helping to lift students up so they too can soar like the eagle. The main objective of the Ombaashi network is to provide First Nations, Inuit and Métis trainees and New Investigators with increased mentorship opportunities to learn about traditional healing knowledge and medicine as well as the opportunity to obtain the guidance and mentorship of traditional healers and knowledge keepers. The Ombaashi Network will facilitate opportunities for First Nations, Inuit and Métis trainees and New Investigators in Canada to learn from traditional knowledge mentors in BC, in their respective home territory, as well as internationally through its partners in the United States, Hawaii, New Zealand, Australia and the South Pacific. This proposed mentorship in traditional healing knowledge and medicine has the potential to be transformative and paradigm-shifting for trainees, mentors and Indigenous communities and knowledge users by giving them the tools and knowledge to navigate the conflict between Indigenous values and mainstream academic values."

The Secwepemc Health Caucus have asked researchers at Thompson Rivers University to help the Secwepemc Nation conduct research into traditional identity ceremonies that were once widely used within the Secwepemc Nation for pre-birth, birth, and with babies, children and adolescents. Identity ceremonies have been used by Indigenous peoples for thousands of years to facilitate a sense of belonging or connection for individual community members as well as to develop a strong sense of self. 
With the assistance of this catalyst grant we are proposing to develop, evaluate, and build upon a Western/Indigenous research tool which combines a method extensively used by the NPA and other Indigenous researchers (Critical Incident Technique), with the traditional Indigenous method of storytelling. Data would be in the form of the participants telling the story of their experience of either participating in an identity ceremony or in helping to facilitate an identity ceremony. This Indigenous form of research asks the real experts i.e. those who actually experienced the ceremonies or those involved in the process of facilitating the use of the ceremony. This research is strength based and based on achieving wellness rather than just addressing health inequities or in closing a ""gap"".

How nurses respond to social iniquities in health through health equity nursing practices,"['McCready, Geneviève']",['N/A'],"[""Bourse De Voyage D'Aci""]",1000.0,400188,"In Canada like elsewhere, social inequalities in health are threatening population health. Given this situation, what are the practices of nurses working in community health to ensure greater health equity? 
My doctoral research project combined oral history (12 interviews) and collaborative ethnography (420 hours in the field) with the nurses of the Pointe-Saint-Charles Community Clinic. 21 nurses and 11 ex-nurses from the Clinic participated in this research, from 2016 to 2018. 
Results highlight the contribution of personal (reciprocal relationship and therapeutic use of the self) and aesthetics (intuitions induced by experience) knowledge to the development of health equity practices. When confronted to people's living conditions and through exchanges with citizens, nurses open their scope of evaluation to include problems in the social and physical environment, as well as a consideration for people's life paths. They also shift the paradigm of intervention, from a controlled and predictable process of care to one that deals with unpredictability, while making themselves available in time, place and approach. Nurses then craft generic nursing interventions learned in school to adapt people's reality. Because the bureaucratic health care system fails to answer urgent needs of people living at disadvantage, nurses will often take immediate actions to alleviate scarcity of material resources and advocate for access to healthcare. At a collective level, nurses also initiate actions on social determinants of health. 
Through this presentation, I intend to restore the place of nursing knowledge historically undervalued within the nursing profession. Submerge in a liberal system of care, acting according to values of equity, inclusion, non-judgement and respect for the right to self-determination represents a political stance of nurses in favor of social justice."

There is a growing ethno-racial population (categorized along ethnic and/or racial lines) in Canada. In addition to health inequities by ethno-racial status there is evidence of inequities by sex/gender status, with men having higher incidence rates of chronic diseases such as hypertension, stroke, diabetes and cancer. These outcomes may further be understood by examining how determinants of health relevant to ACBM's health interrelate to exacerbate their health experiences. Masculinity and race are two determinants of unique relevance to ACBM. There appears to be social and mental health dynamics between hegemonic masculinity and race demonstrated through disproportional adverse outcomes on income, gun violence, and mental health in ACBM. Most of what we know about the variants in men's health by race, ethnicity, and other social determinants is grounded in the U.S. context and focuses on chronic physical illnesses. This project aims to fill a gap in Canadian health equity literature by exploring social and individual determinants that impact on the health status of ACBM, specifically, behaviors associated with obesity and chronic diseases, (i.e. eating practices, physical activity). An interdisciplinary team of researchers and knowledge users with complementary expertise will develop a research program that brings awareness to chronic disease prevention, health promotion, and health inequities among ACBM. Goals are to: 1) establish a Canadian ACBM Health Network, 2) conduct a needs assessment of ACBM in four metropolitan areas, 3) adapt a multi-level cardiovascular disease and diabetes prevention intervention based on the needs assessment, 4) pilot and evaluate the intervention in two demographically different cities, 5) develop and implement a knowledge translation plan to communicate preliminary pilot results to knowledge users."
Socio-economic status and the comprehension and Use of Nutrition Information among Adolescents in Canada.,"['McCrory, Cassondra']",['N/A'],"['Diet', 'Health Behaviour', 'Health Communication', 'Health Disparities', 'Health Policy', 'Nutrition', 'Obesity']",17500.0,281262,"Objective: Adolescents are important populations to target for nutrition interventions in Canada given relatively high intakes of calories, fat, sodium and increasing prevalence of nutrition-related conditions within these groups. Adolescence is a period of transition, characterized by increasing independence, a growing role in food shopping for themselves and their families, and long-term eating patterns that can track through adulthood. Nutritional labelling policies, such as the Nutrition Facts table (NFt) on pre-packaged foods, represent a low-cost population-level health intervention. Research suggests nutrition labels may promote healthier food choices when read and used; however, comprehension of the nutrient amounts, serving size and how to compare food limit effectiveness of nutrition labels. In addition, comprehension and use of the NFt varies by socio-economic status. To date, there is little evidence on the effectiveness of nutrition labelling policies among young people. The proposed study will examine socio-economic differences in how young people in Canada use the NFts when choosing and comparing foods, and to test modifications to NFts.       
Methods: The study will consist of an online survey with a sample of 1,000 young people (ages 16-18) from across Canada. A between-participants experiment to empirically test the efficacy of the current and modified NFts on comprehension and use of serving size and % Daily Value (% DV) information when choosing and comparing foods will be conducted. Analyses will explore potential differences in the efficacy of the NFts by socio-economic factors such as income, education, immigrant status, and ethnicity.     
Potential Impact: The findings will inform regulatory changes to the NFt, and interventions for improving young people's understanding and use of NFts when choosing and comparing food products. Results will provide evidence for communicating nutrition information on NFts and other forms of labelling."

Related health care costs and lost productivity are estimated to cost the Canadian economy over $80 billion per year. Cannabis use may be a risk factor for mental health problems, especially during youth when the brain is still developing. However, research has not established if cannabis use leads to mental health problems, or if mental health problems and other factors lead adolescents to use cannabis. Understanding this relationship is a critical public health issue in Canada given recent cannabis legalization and Canadian youth being among the heaviest users of cannabis in the world. This project will examine whether cannabis use causes mental health problems and whether this relationship differs based on age of use and sex/gender. Across four large contemporary longitudinal datasets, this project will analyze data from over 15,000 people across multiple life stages (adolescents, young adults, and middle-aged and older adults) in Canada and the US. Participants have been followed over time with repeated assessments to determine the timing of cannabis use and mental health problems. This project will allow us to precisely dismantle the chronological relations between cannabis use mental health problems.

To supplement previous AOF findings and gain a deeper understanding of how these impacts have been ameliorated through participation in effective interventions and supports, qualitative research will be undertaken in the form of focus group discussions with mothers, youth, and community stakeholders. A recovery survey for mothers and youth will also take place, focused on studying how to bolster post-traumatic growth following stressful life events. 
IMPORTANCE: We are poised to rigorously examine and compare the changing nature of social, economic, and health-related impacts associated with COVID-19 over time to provide contemporary evidence to decision makers to assist in the planning of future pandemic waves and long-term recovery."
Intergenerational Transmission of Maternal ACEs on Child Behaviour at age 5: Risk and Resilience Factors,"['McDonald, Sheila W']","['Graham, Susan', 'Madigan, Sheri L', 'Tough, Suzanne C']","['Adverse Childhood Experiences', 'Child Behavior', 'Cohort', 'Intergenerational', 'Mechanisms', 'Parenting', 'Resilience']",74979.0,363426,"Early experiences of abuse or growing up in a household where there is significant dysfunction, such as mental illness or substance abuse, can influence the development of poor health outcomes later in life, including heart disease, suicidal thoughts, addiction, and depression. A landmark study in the 1990s by an American health insurance company found that the more adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) a person has, the higher their risk later in life of health and social problems. Early abuse and exposure to stressful experiences over time can also impact parenting, in that new mothers who were abused or grew up in chaos during childhood may face challenges with their new baby, display harsh parenting practices, and have decreased confidence in their ability to parent. They may face challenges in building stable, supportive homes that in turn can influence child development and family well-being.  

This study will use data from an existing data source that has collected detailed information over time from pregnant women, following them up after delivery and into the early years of parenting. Types of information collected include mental and physical health, parenting, child care, social support, and resources used in the community. This study also collected information on maternal ACEs and recently collected detailed information on child behavior at age 5. The present project will combine all this information and use it to answer research questions on associations among maternal ACEs, parenting, and child behavior in the next generation. The research team is also interested in examining mechanisms and factors that protect against poor child outcomes and foster maternal and child resilience. A better understanding of these links can help develop approaches to support new parents and optimize child outcomes."

Youth is a developmental period of significant social, emotional, biological, and contextual change, simultaneously associated with a surge in mental health difficulties. Preliminary evidence at the national level is indicating reduced mental health during the pandemic, particularly among youth. High-quality, contemporary data on coping and recovery for families and youth during and after an unprecedented pandemic is crucial to inform further action and resource allocation in any future periods of lockdown, increased or re-infection, and future pandemics. Further, the acute and sustainable costs and benefits of aggressive public health measures such as physical distancing on the well-being of families and communities are unknown. The All Our Families (AOF) study, an ongoing prospective pregnancy cohort in Calgary, will survey families at three times points over one year to capture the discrete and longitudinal patterns of direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic on mental health, social connections, school achievement, sleep, and screen-time. AOF is uniquely positioned to disentangle emerging and sustained vulnerabilities from pre-existing vulnerabilities to development using longitudinal data that reflect the individual, family, and community determinants of health. Longitudinal data analysis will uncover patterns of resilience and vulnerability immediately, and over time for mothers and youth. Identification the factors that influence family and youth health and well-being during a pandemic is critical to the development of public health communications and strategies to improve outcomes."
Social factors and physical activity in older adults: Identifying predictors across vulnerable populations,"['McDonough, Meghan H']",['N/A'],"['Physical Activity', 'Social Relationships', 'Social Support', 'Vulnerable Populations']",70000.0,388331,"Physical activity is important for maintaining and improving health and independence among older adults. But more than 80% of older Canadians do not meet physical activity recommendations, and physical activity declines with age. Older adults who feel more supported by others in their social network tend to be more physically active. This association suggests that social support may be important for physical activity promotion for older adults, and may help with overcoming barriers to physical activity and enhance motivation and engagement. However, there are many ways in which people can attempt to support each other, and little is known about what forms of support best predict physical activity. This gap in our understanding is particularly acute for more vulnerable segments of the population who tend to be less physically active, and who are at greater risk for being socially isolated.  
This study will examine which social support factors assessed in the Canadian longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) predict physical activity among adults age 65 and older. Furthermore, it will examine which predictors of physical activity are strongest for those who live alone, have low incomes, are members of an ethnic minority, are immigrants to Canada, are women, are LGBTQ, and are caregivers. The CLSA provides a unique opportunity to investigate this question because it includes an unprecedented variety of social support measures (e.g., marital/partner status, social networks, online social networking, social participation, availability of social support, and functional measures of social support such as emotional and tangible support), and a large sample of older adults including many vulnerable populations. Results of this study will be used to help design ways to improve social support for physical activity among older adults."

The goal of Moving Together is to strengthen this partnership through collaborative discussions with academic, municipal, and community stakeholders to develop a program of research on age-friendly cities related to physical activity and inclusion for older adults, including vulnerable populations. Physical inactivity and social isolation are critical issues facing older Canadians, and there is potential for researchers, municipalities, and communities to develop innovative solutions to better support physical activity and social participation among older adults, particularly those from vulnerable populations. Project activities include collaborative events aimed at identifying key issues and priorities with municipal and community stakeholders, identifying prospective sites for innovation and research, and developing a grant proposal for a program of research on supporting active, socially inclusive cities for older adults. Moving Together will create opportunities for collaboration across City of Calgary initiatives addressing age-friendly cities, active aging, mental health, active transportation, healthy cities; University of Calgary researchers focused on aging; and community programs with innovative ideas and unique opportunities for engaging older adults. The project will identify research questions that address key priorities and emerging issues related to physical activity, social inclusion, aging, and engaging vulnerable populations, and develop a program of research focused on closing the knowledge-to-practice gap in creating healthy, active, inclusive cities for older adults."

However, physical activity tends to decline with age, and social isolation (lack of sufficient quantity and quality of connections with others) is a top issue for older adults. Physical activity and social connections may also have positive effects on each other, as social connections can be a source of support for participating in physical activity, and physical activity contexts can be a source of social connections for older adults. Our prior research with baseline data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) identified several social factors (social network, marital/partner status, social contact, social participation, online communication, and perceptions of tangible support) that were significant predictors of physical activity in adults aged 65 and older. Furthermore, some of these associations were moderated by sex, living arrangements, and income. However, the lack of longitudinal data precluded examining whether those associations were significant prospectively, and the possibility of reciprocal associations, which would provide important evidence about the possible causal and reciprocal effects among social connections and physical activity for older adults. This two time point longitudinal study will examine (1) whether social connection variables predict physical activity prospectively; and (2) whether physical activity also predicts social connection variables prospectively, suggesting reciprocal effects using data from participants age 65 and older from the CLSA. In both questions we will examine (3) whether these associations are moderated by sex, living arrangement, and income. Results of this study will be used to help design ways to improve social connectedness and physical activity among older adults."

As the 'baby boom' generation sits on the precipice of retirement, their better health has policy makers worried about the costs of supporting retirees for longer periods of time. The problem and one of its most widely-touted solutions, extending working life, are talked about mainly in economic terms, and with reference to average improvements in health. As a result, we know very little about the health implications, for individuals, of this policy approach. Is continuing to work at older ages realistic only for those in better health to begin with, or for those with certain privileges? Will the better-off gain, in health terms, from extending working lives, while the less-well-off are harmed? Or, is continuing to work likely to benefit all, and perhaps even reduce health inequalities among older adults? Our study tries to answer these questions by analyzing health and work information collected over many years, on people over the age of 50 in the US, Britain, Germany, Denmark and Italy. We anticipate that our results will help guide Canadian policy makers as they grapple with the issues raised by an ageing and increasingly healthy population."

Involvement in paid work became a fact of life, even for women with major family responsibilities, and households have become increasingly diverse. Two critical questions for the public, research communities and policy makers alike are: (1) What are the consequences of change for women's health in mid-life? And (2) Has change been beneficial for some women but harmful for others?

Researchers are only beginning to address these questions, and findings remain contradictory. This study helps to clarify the situation. In it, we examine the impact of social change on women's health using data collected from household surveys in the US and Britain that follow the same people over many decades. We use information about health at mid-life, and examine its relationship to past work and family experiences. We also take into account education, race, and other background characteristics that may help predict whether they do well or poorly. We then compare results for women whose career- and family-building years occurred during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, to assess the long-range health consequences of the changes that occurred over this period. The results of this study will help lay the groundwork for understanding the health challenges upcoming cohorts of Canadian women are likely to face as they approach mid-life."

Many supports and interventions are directed toward this goal. It is critical for clients, service providers, and policy makers to understand the key factors that predict changes in life quality for children and youth with chronic conditions. These factors may include personal (e.g., children's emotional functioning), interpersonal (e.g., children's social participation), or environmental factors (e.g., supportive community environments).

This study will address two unexplored research areas: 1) the changing nature of quality of life for youth with chronic conditions over a three-year period, and 2) the factors that predict change in quality of life for these youth. Six hundred youth aged 11 to 17 years (and their parents) who receive services from OACRS centres will participate. Individuals in this age span are expected to experience key life transitions during the three-year period (e.g., changes in school, independence expectations, health and mobility, role within the family and community). Participants will be assessed at four time points. Children and parents will each complete a brief questionnaire that includes two validated measures of quality of life, in addition to a set of measures of factors thought to predict changes in life quality. These measures focus on children's physical and emotional functioning, self-determination, spirituality, social participation, and family and environmental supports. Advanced statistical analysis procedures will be used to evaluate changes in quality of life and to determine predictors of change. The results will inform policy decisions about where to best allocate funds. This information is vital to ensure rehabilitation and allied services address those areas of children's lives that are most likely to maximize their quality of life."
Risk and Protective Factors for Healthy Aging: A Departure from the Traditional Successful Aging Framework,"['McDowell, Cynthia N']",['N/A'],"['Aging Well', 'Chronic Illness', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthy Aging', 'Intervention', 'Longitudinal', 'Multidimensional', 'Prevention', 'Risk Factors', 'Successful Aging']",105000.0,458504,"Despite decades of research, there is little consensus on the operational definition of 'successful aging' or which variables significantly influence aging trajectories. Currently, the successful aging paradigm is not maximally effective in identifying risk and protective factors for optimal healthy aging or elucidating how these variables are interrelated in later life and across time. Using a longitudinal and multidimensional framework, the current research aims to create a novel method for measuring successful aging by employing a rigorous data-driven approach examining several indicators (e.g., blood pressure, depression, social support) across multiple health dimensions (e.g., biological, psychological, social) to identify trajectories and predictors of health in older to later life. The objectives are to i) identify subgroups of aging on the basis of longitudinal trajectories of change in multiple health domains, and ii) pinpoint specific risk and protective factors that contribute to the aging trajectories, and how they interact across time. Methods: Participants include 304 older adults (aged 64-92 years; 32% male) from Project MIND, a well-established 8-year longitudinal study. Each year participants were assessed on numerous cognitive, physical, biological, and psychosocial measures, as well as their demographics, chronic medical conditions, and health behaviours. Latent class growth mixture modeling will be employed to identify distinct aging trajectories across years and examine individual determinants impacting these aging trajectories. Implications: Standardizing the methods and biopsychosocial measures of successful aging will provide a deepened understanding of the risk and protective factors responsible for healthy and pathological aging. Demonstrating the importance of psychosocial and lifestyle factors, regardless of chronological age or disease, can promote a healthy society and inform policy-based preventative and intervention strategies."

We believe that it is critical to integrate these seemingly distinct approaches to get closer to the heart of the complex interaction between personal, social, economic, and biological influences that affect the health of older people living in Northern and Aboriginal communities. ""Inflammaging"" (the influence of inflammation on the aging process) contributes significantly to poor health and declining function among older adults in general, and specifically in Northern and Aboriginal communities. Dementia and chronic lung disease are both associated with inflammatory processes and are all-too-common problems affecting older adults in these communities. Our research team will develop ways to predict how these common diseases are likely to impact on our daily lives, and develop assessment tools for clinicians to be able to advise the individual of his or her own risk for loss of independence.  Finally, the study will develop ways to delay the impact of disability associated with dementia and chronic lung disease. The results of this research could be widely applied to other common diseases affecting older people and could ultimately lead to a scientifically validated, community-based integrated approach to healthy aging developed in, by, and for Northern and Aboriginal communities."

Thus, onset of frailty occurs at a much younger age and the burden of morbidity among older Indigenous persons with dementia results in substantial caregiver burden. Diverse community contexts, complex relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians, and continued colonial policies governing access to services, all present significant challenges to empowering communities [3]. The purpose of this proposal is to engage local integrated Knowledge Translation (iKT) teams to develop, evaluate and implement care models that empower caregivers and communities to support people living with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) and cognitive decline including dementia. Our goal is to address the unmet needs of Indigenous persons living with or at risk for dementia, and to support their families and communities to reduce caregiver burden.

Strengths-based, resilience, centred programs are therefore needed to overcome these inequities. With the support of Indigenous youth in Manitoba, we developed a peer-based mentoring program, centred on an Indigenous model of resilience; Dr.Martin Brokenleg's Circle of Courage, called the Indigenous Youth Mentorship Program (IYMP). During the last 2 years as a Pathways 2 Implementation Research Team we expanded from 5 communities in Manitoba and to 13 communities across 4 provinces in Canada. Using a participatory action model, guided by the teachings of elders, knowledge keepers and youth on our team, we will build on the successes of the past 2 years to (1) explore a novel pathway through which IYMP can reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes in youth, through the Indigenous concept of Mino-pimatisiwin/bimaadiziwin ""living in a god way"",  (2) deepen the reach of IYMP within existing communities, (3) explore relational models of rippling IYMP to new communities, and (4) study the process of moving IYMP from a university-based program to a sustainable community-led organization.

To better understand how HIA can support prevention in a complex federal landscape, this research will use realist review to investigate legal contexts, understand prevention pathways, and evaluate health outcomes across Canadian health care jurisdictions.

There are three research questions that inform the project. 1) What evidence exists about contexts, mechanisms, and outcomes for HIA in environmental health and lifestyle-related chronic disease prevention? 2) Where should HIA best practices vary across Canadian jurisdictions? 3) How can integrated knowledge translation support realist review? Data collection and analysis will involve interviews with international practitioners, legal research at various levels of government, consultation with public health and other professional health associations, and the evaluation of health outcomes as part of HIA. 

 ""Supporting Opportunities for Prevention through Health Impact Assessment (SOPHIA)"" will provide a relevant and timely investigation into HIA as an innovative process with significant potential for population health interventions. It will employ realist review to contribute tools and evidence for HIA best practices to address preventable morbidity and mortality.

Quebec is the province where the percentage of smokers is highest, which means that children and teenagers in Quebec are more likely to live with a smoker than anywhere else in Canada.  Importantly, inhaling secondhand smoke is linked to serious diseases, even among non-smokers.  Studies now show that inhaling secondhand smoke is not only linked to diseases, but possibly also to starting to smoke.  Scientists have found that non-smoking children who inhale secondhand smoke are more likely to start smoking when they are teenagers, compared to children who do not inhale secondhand smoke.  Other scientists have found that non-smoking adults who inhale secondhand smoke at work are more likely to feel negative physical sensations similar to withdrawal effects.  Another group of scientists found that non-smoking children who inhale secondhand smoke are more likely to report having symptoms of feeling dependent on nicotine (the addictive substance in cigarettes).  Scientists can measure exposure to secondhand smoke in people's saliva or hair.  Recently, scientists found that the speed with which people metabolize nicotine in their body is determined by certain DNA genes.  Our project seeks to recruit students in 7th grade in French-speaking high schools, a time that is typically before students start smoking.  Students will answer questions about their beliefs about smoking and its consequences.  We will collect a saliva and hair sample to measure exposure to secondhand smoke.  We will also rub a swab on the inside of their mouth to help us identify the gene for nicotine metabolism.  The students will be contacted twice each year during high school so we can identify those who start smoking.

It tells our bodies when we should be awake or asleep and it stays on time by using information from the environment around us, like light, regularly timed meals, and activity. The body clock controls the rhythms of most functions including body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and hormone release. Sometimes the timing of these bodily functions gets disrupted and out of sync with the rhythm of the body clock, which is called circadian misalignment (e.g., bed/wake times shifts later). Teenagers experience many changes in the timing of their sleep. Teens commonly go to bed later and sleep in on the weekends. Our 24hr society promotes this later sleep delay. Using gadgets late at night, staying up late on weekends, and having inconsistent routines across the week can contribute to this shift toward later sleep timing. Shifts in sleep times often happen during puberty. Girls start going to bed later before boys, which coincides with their earlier puberty onset than boys. In fact, compared to adults, teenagers have a body clock slightly longer than 24 hours. Our project tracks the evolution of the circadian timing system changes across puberty. We will investigate if circadian misalignment might be a culprit in child obesity and cardiometabolic health. Wearable gadgets will be worn by teens to monitor their sleep, activity, temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure. The information we learn from this project will help parents, schools, and policy makers develop better prevention programs to improve childhood health.

In addition to developing an intervention that is accessible and easy to use, we will develop this intervention to be culturally responsive to diverse populations, as these populations are often underserved by current available programming. 

We will recruit a sample of 273 parents of children aged 3-14 years with developmental disabilities from across Canada. We will measure psychological well-being (primary outcome), parental resilience, depressive and anxiety symptoms (secondary outcomes), as well as demographic information. T-tests will be used to test the effectiveness of the intervention. If effective, we will work with partners to make it widely available."

Determinants of Physical Activity and Nutrition Among Anishinaabe Children in Six First Nation Communities,"['McGregor, Lorrilee']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2800.0,346575,"This study explored the determinants that influence physical activity and nutrition among Anishinaabe children. Eight focus groups were conducted with a total of 33 caregivers in six First Nation communities in northeastern Ontario.

Participants reported that the patterns of physical activity among children in their communities are different from previous generations who were active through walking, outside play and physically demanding chores. Four themes emerged as influences on physical activity: lifestyle changes, technology, safety concerns, and the impact of the colonial legacy on community programs.

Food systems in these First Nation communities have been influenced by colonialism. Food systems are the way in which food is procured, distributed, processed, the nutritional consequences, and the sociocultural meanings. Food used to be mainly from the land but is now mainly from the market although traditional foods remain important both nutritionally and culturally.

Colonialism continues to impact on the health and well-being of Indigenous peoples in these six First Nation communities. Addressing obesity among children in First Nation communities requires the recognition of the effects of historical and contemporary colonialism on health behaviours. Healing from intergenerational trauma can take place through the continued revitalization of practices that connect Indigenous peoples to their culture and land through activities like hunting and fishing."
Adapting Wiisokotaatiwin (an Indigenous research method) from Urban to Land-Based: Anishinaabeg Elders' Land-Based Knowledge Transfer Research Project,"['McGuire-Adams, Tricia D', 'Smith, Wayne']","['Smith, Gary', 'Smith, Norma', 'McGuire, Patricia D', 'Pitawanakwat, Brock T']","['Health', ""Indigenous Elders' Knowledge Transfer"", 'Indigenous Research Methodology', 'Land-Based Physical Activity', 'On-The-Land Knowledge', 'Wellbeing', 'Wellness']",149763.0,379039,"Indigenous health researchers maintain research must centre the knowledge of Indigenous peoples to identify better and more sustainable ways to foster wellbeing for Indigenous communities. Yet, there remains a need to create Indigenous-led, and community-driven, research projects that frame the entire research within a specific Indigenous research methodology. Furthermore, Indigenous Elders' knowledge of wellness stemming from their lands is imperative to identifying resistance strategies to ill health, and for passing down experiential knowledge of wellness gained from local environments. The need to learn from the knowledge, life experiences, and healing processes from Elders regarding their lands is particularly vital, as Indigenous Elders' life expediencies are less than non-Indigenous elders. In response to these needs, the current research team, led by three Naicatchewenin First Nation community leaders and three Anishinaabeg researchers, have two main objectives: 1) through sharing circles in a traditional roundhouse and engaging in land-based activities, we will ask how do traditional knowledge transfer activities, such as hunting, trapping, fishing, harvesting, walking-the-land, ceremonial processes etc., enhance Anishinaabeg wholistic wellbeing? 2) through Wiisokotaatiwin, an innovative Anishinaabeg-informed research method, this study will investigate how Wiisokotaatiwin may be used as an on-the-land research method to amplify Indigenous approaches to health and wellness?"
Urban Anishinaabeg Women's Physical Well-Being:  An Approach to Decolonization through Physical Activity,"['McGuire-Adams, Tricia D']",['N/A'],"['Anishinaabeg Knowledge', 'Anishinaabeg Theory', 'Decolonization', 'Focus Groups', 'Health Disparities', 'Indigenous Feminism', 'Indigenous Research Methodology', 'Indigenous Women', 'Key Informant Interviews', 'Physical Activity']",108000.0,317905,"My PhD research will investigate if physical activity specifically geared to gaining physical strength coupled with a direct challenging of one's internalized colonialism can be used to change the negative trajectory of urban Anishinaabeg women's physical health with the aim to provide a pedagogical praxis.
Stage one: In order to identify ways for Anishinaabeg women to experience improved health, meaningful solutions to the effects of colonialism are best approached with the aim of decolonization and through an Indigenous lens. As such, I will build upon Anishinaabeg theory (Simpson, 2011; McGuire, 2009) by articulating Anishinaabeg women's ceremonial and ancestral narratives to show how they inform physicality as a decolonization process.
Stage two: Conduct Wiisokotaatiwin (Anishinaabeg concept meaning coming together for a purpose) with a minimum of 10 Anishinaabeg women from the ONFC to engage in a kettle bell workout, a circle dialogue, and journaling for 10 weeks. The goal is to uncover how their PA may or may not influence decolonization processes; I will blog about the process of Wiisokotaatiwin.
Stage three: PA has the power to transform, to assist in Anishinaabeg women's decolonization journey as it connects to culture while simultaneously assisting in regenerating physicality. As such, I will conduct 10 key informant interviews with Anishinaabeg women who maintain a high level of PA and who also connect aspects of their culture or epistemologies to their PA, to understand what drives them to maintain their PA as it may link to their decolonization processes.
Stage four: Based on the results from Wiisokotaatiwin and the interviews, I will develop a pedagogical praxis (e.g. a PA program developed to foster personal decolonization) which will also be developed with and reviewed by the research participants. I will also seek wide dissemination and knowledge translation with the 27 Friendship Centres in Ontario."

"Opioids and Cannabinoids in Canada: a public forum series on current research, social impact, and regulation","['McGuirk, Shawn']",['N/A'],"['Dissemination', 'Drug Policy', 'Medical And Recreational Marijuana', 'Opioid Crisis', 'Public Education', 'Public Forum', 'Science Policy', 'Student-Driven Initiative']",12000.0,372939,"Overuse of opioid drugs like Oxycontin or Fentanyl can lead to crippling dependence; this has contributed to an opioid crisis in Canada which presents an important challenge for healthcare professionals, policymakers, and patients dealing with chronic pain. Many have turned to medical marijuana as a more moderate treatment for pain relief, which has prompted a surge of research into the mechanism of action of its active compounds, tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). As researchers uncover new insights into the medicinal effects of marijuana, others have reported that its recreational use may have negative effects on educational outcomes and in brain development among adolescents. This raises important questions in light of its impending legalization in Canada. What are the steps necessary to ensure proper regulation? What lessons can be learned from other countries?

Drawing on the success of our previous public forums, Science & Policy Exchange is organizing a public forum series in 2017-2018 to disseminate current research and policy issues surrounding the medical and recreational uses of cannabis, as well as on the causes and possible solutions to address the Canadian opioid crisis. These forums are a platform for the public to engage with experts in this field, to not only increase their knowledge on these topics but also to ask their burning questions and inform the experts on the public's concerns. In the long-term, we hope these forums empower the public to take an informed decision or stance when faced with issues of chronic pain, drug use, or addiction - whether it be in addressing social stigma, new federal policies, or their own health and well-being.

Drawing on the success of previous public forums, Science & Policy Exchange is organizing a forum and panel discussion set in October 2016 to introduce the aspects of genomics policy most relevant to the layperson. Our panel of experts will discuss how genetic data is used in research and in the clinic, as well as why additional policy considerations are necessary to regulate new developments in genomics such as prognostic and at-home genetic tests.
