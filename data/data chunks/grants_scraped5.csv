Pregnancy weight gain charts for Canadian women: developing a novel tool to establish optimal gestational weight gain for maternal and child health,"['Hutcheon, Jennifer A', 'Bodnar, Lisa']","['Platt, Robert W', 'Walker, Mark C', 'Woolcott, Christy G']","['Fetal Growth', 'Gestational Weight Gain', 'Maternal Obesity', 'Pregnancy', 'Reference Chart']",240308.0,303786,"Most Canadian women gain too much weight during pregnancy. This is a concern because women with high weight gain in pregnancy are less likely to return to their pre-pregnancy weight after delivery, more likely to become obese, and more likely have obese children. In this project, our goal is to develop reference charts to help monitor and assess pregnancy weight gain of Canadian women. The charts will be based on the weight gain patterns of women with healthy pregnancies delivering in smaller and larger centres in western (BC), central (Ontario), and eastern (Nova Scotia) Canada. We will then identify the ranges on the weight gain charts that are linked with the best pregnancy outcomes for mother and baby. This project will produce a novel tool for women and their care providers to support appropriate weight gain in pregnancy, and address multiple topics that are research priorities for the CIHR such as reproduction, maternal health, and obesity."
Fetal growth and risk of spontaneous preterm birth,"['Hutcheon, Jennifer A']",['N/A'],"['Fetal Growth', 'Perinatal Morbidity', 'Perinatal Mortality', 'Population Health', 'Preterm Birth']",165000.0,180890,"Infants born at preterm gestational ages have a higher chance of death or serious complications after birth. While poor fetal growth is known to increase the chance of preterm birth occurring because of physician intervention (i.e. a physician deciding to induce birth or perform a Caesarean section delivery because the fetus is small), it is not as well known if poor fetal growth will also increase the risk of a spontaneous preterm birth. The goal of this project is to better understand the relationship between fetal growth and risk of spontaneous preterm birth and associated clinical complications in newborn infants. Prenatal ultrasound estimates of fetal weight will be linked with electronic medical records of maternal characteristics and pregnancy outcomes. Fetal growth trajectories will then be matched with spontaneous preterm birth and clinical complication status in order to identify growth patterns associated with higher risk. This information will then be used to create a tool for physicians to better predict pregnancies at increased risk of spontaneous preterm delivery. This project will help increase our understanding of the reasons why some infants are born preterm, and will produce a new tool to screen for high risk pregnancies in prenatal care."
Implications for Health: Hunting and Gathering among Métis in British Columbia.,"['Hutchinson, Peter J']","['Bottorff, Joan L', 'Corbett, Jonathan', 'Evans, Michael J', 'Jones, Gareth R', 'Kurtz, Donna L', 'Sookraj, Dixon']","['Chronic Disease Prevention', 'Mental Health', 'Métis', 'Physical Health']",75202.0,205091,"It is well established that there is a disparity in health status and associated social determinants of health between Aboriginal people, including the Métis, and the general population of Canada. Participation in traditional activities, such as hunting and gathering, has been utilized to improve health status. The purpose of this study is to assess the health promoting effects of hunting and gathering amongst Métis in British Columbia.  To identify the health implications of hunting and gathering 3 phases of research will be implemented, first a case study will utilize focus group and individual interviews with Métis community members and stakeholders to assess the engagement in hunting and gathering, perceived and physical and social benefits.  Researchers will also participate with harvesters and utilize global positioning systems and other technologies to monitor the level of physical activity in harvesting activities. The second phase will utilize the case study data to develop a survey tool that will be administered to Métis hunters and gathers from across British Columbia. Once the qualitative data and quantitative data are collected and analyzed community discussions will begin in phase 3. The aim of these discussions is to develop guidelines to support the development of culturally appropriate approaches to support healthy living in Métis communities."
"Models for Primary Medical Care, Nursing Care and Personal Care in Long-Term Care Homes: Systematic Reviews to Inform Change in Canada","['Hutton, Brian E', 'Watt, Jennifer A']","['Garritty, Chantelle M', 'Lunny, Carole A', 'Shea, Beverley J', 'Straus, Sharon E', 'Welch, Vivian A', 'Wong, Eric K']","['Knowledge Synthesis', 'Long-Term Care', 'Nursing', 'Nursing Home', 'Older Adults', 'Primary Care', 'Seniors', 'Systematic Review']",110925.0,443936,"Older adults are a rapidly growing segment of the population and live longer and healthier lives than in previous generations. In 2014, adults aged 65+ years accounted for six million (15.6%) of Canada's population, and the government estimates that by 2030, this number will surpass 9.5 million (23%). The impact of COVID-19 in long-term care homes (LTCH) in Canada highlighted longstanding challenges in this sector. 

Recently, a Canadian policy briefing addressed these challenges in Canada's long-term care (LTC) sector, and made recommendations that changes be made to the healthcare workforce. Amongst the most vital issues to address are improvements for the provision of primary medical care for LTC residents, as well as for direct care provided by nurses and personal support workers. To do so, there is an urgent need for researchers to identify and review the currently available research in this area to support comparisons of different models of care and their impact on key measures such as quality of resident care, resident quality of life and hospital admissions.

To address this need, we will conduct two systematic reviews of currently available research to answer the following questions:
1. What are the effective models for primary medical care for residents of LTCHs to optimize their quality of care, quality of life and health outcomes?

2. What are the effective models for direct care (including nursing care and personal care) for residents of LTCHs to optimize their quality of care, quality of life and health outcomes?

We will use best practice methods to carry out the planned systematic reviews of the evidence with a multi-disciplinary research team having expertise in public health, geriatric medicine and epidemiology. We will partner with Canadian organizations in the LTC setting to disseminate our findings and to maximize their uptake toward optimizing long-term care homes for Canadians."
National study of environmental determinants of adolescent violence in Canada.,"['Huynh, Quynh N']",['N/A'],"['Adolescent Health', 'Adolescent Violence', 'Built Environment', 'Epidemiology', 'Geographic Information System']",17500.0,200209,"Rationale/Background: Youth violence is an important public health concern. Growing rates of youth violence suggest a need for greater understanding of their causes. Theory proposes that the health of youth populations results from both individual behaviours and environmental influences. The built environment is one possible influence that is worthy of study. It may affect violent behaviours in this age group.

Objective: To examine the effects of the physical surroundings on youth violence in Canada.

Methods: This study will be based on Canadian records of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) Survey. In 2009/2010, the HBSC was administered in 500 schools to 20 000 students from grades 6-10. Measures of physical fighting and weapon carrying will be used to profile violent behaviours. Geographical Information Systems will be used to link this data to factors in the physical surroundings of students' schools and neighbourhoods.

Implications: This study is important as it will further understand youth violence in Canada and the role of physical surroundings on the health of youth. This will inform the prevention and intervention programs, and perhaps the next generation of violence control strategies."

The HHiT study is a prospective cohort study that is tracking the health and housing status of a representative sample of approximately 1,200 homeless and vulnerably housed single adults in Vancouver, Toronto, and Ottawa over a two-year follow-up period. In this renewal grant application, we propose to extend the observation period of our study from two years, as allowed by the funding for our initial grant, to four years. This renewal will achieve the following scientific goals: (i) acquiring new knowledge on the course of homelessness and vulnerable housing over a four-year period; (ii) discovering the connections between housing transitions and health care utilization; and (iii) achieving a deeper understanding of the interactions between housing transitions and health status through qualitative interviews. An extension of the study will take advantage of a unique opportunity to understand the complex longitudinal relationships between housing and health in a well-established cohort of homeless and vulnerably housed single adults. Through detailed analyses of qualitative interviews and our robust longitudinal quantitative data, our study will help determine what types of integrated housing and support services are necessary to achieve housing stability and improved health outcomes for people experiencing homelessness and vulnerable housing. These findings will be invaluable for health and social policy decision makers in developing better evidence-based policies for housing and health."

People who are homeless suffer from high rates of physical and mental illness, and they often need specialized services and supports to obtain stable housing and improve their life situation. This research program will study innovative interventions to help Canadians who are homeless to achieve better health and well-being, and ultimately to end homelessness itself.  

This research program has three main goals. The first goal is to improve the ability of housing and support programs known as ""Housing First"" to end homelessness and improve well-being for people who have been chronically homeless. The second goal is to develop a new program that will help homeless young people between the ages of 14-25 to get stable housing, move forward, and lay the foundation for success in their lives. The third goal is to develop an intervention that will help homeless people who have recently been in the hospital to connect to services, have a better recovery, and stay out of the hospital. 

This research program will improve the health and well-being of Canadians experiencing homelessness and enhance the ability of our health care and social service systems to meet their needs. In doing so, this program will help make Canada a healthier society for all."
Refugee integration and long-term health outcomes in Canada,"['Hynie, Michaela', 'McGrath, Susan', 'Mckenzie, Kwame J']","['Agic, Branka', 'Ahmad, Farah', 'Arya, Akshaya N', 'Bayoumi, Ahmed M', 'Clark-Kazak, Christina', 'Cleveland, Janet', 'Diaz, Marcela', 'Kuo, Ben C', 'Rummens, Joanna (Anneke) W', 'Shakya, Yogendra']","['Chronic Diseases', 'Community Based Research', 'Mental Health', 'Program Evaluation', 'Refugees', 'Social Determinants Of Health']",1353165.0,347269,"Canada provides protection to refugees from overseas through two different programs.  In one, the government selects and supports refugees for the first year of settlement: government assisted refugees (GARs).  In the other, support is provided by volunteer groups: private sponsored refugees (PSRs).  Private sponsorship is unique to Canada but is of increasing interest internationally. Yet, despite resettling a third of refugees as PSRs, there is little research comparing GAR and PSR effectiveness in supporting the integration of refugees into society.   

Resettled refugees have poorer health than host populations. Studies show that social integration affects wellness but we do not have much research examining how the experiences of settlement and integration contribute to the long-term health of refugees. Refugees face unique challenges prior to migration, including exposure to trauma, prolonged uncertainty, hazardous living conditions, and disrupted education trajectories. In the short-term, security, less hazardous living conditions, and access to health services result in improvements in resettled refugees' health. However, research with other immigrant groups in Canada shows that in the long term, health and well-being are affected by newcomers' sense of inclusion, respect and belonging in their new country. Thus, early improvements in refugee health may be followed by deterioration if social integration is not successful. 

This pan-Canadian study will compare how GAR and PSR resettlement programs support long-term social integration pathways for refugees and the impact of these pathways on physical and mental health. We will collect data from adult resettled refugees arriving between 2015 and 2017 in 3 of Canada's largest refugee resettlement provinces: British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec.  By understanding what leads to successful outcomes we can improve refugee settlement services and policies, and ultimately the health and well-being of refugees."

Little is known about substance use and drug poisoning in rural Canada. Broadening public and academic knowledge about substance use in this context is an urgent public policy priority. This Café will present scientific evidence on the state of drug poisonings in rural Canada, and highlight the voices of rural Canadians who have been impacted by the drug poisoning crisis. The overall goal of the Café is to increase public understanding on the need to effectively address drug poisoning in rural communities and discuss the implications of current evidence for health system planning and future research. Information will be presented through a panel discussion, question and answer period, and small group discussions. The Café will be of interest to the public, including people who use drugs (PWUD), families, community-based organizations, clinicians, decision makers, knowledge keepers, elected officials and the general public."

This stress, and the suboptimal lifestyles in which it manifests, widens health disparities in these populations. As such, type 2 diabetes has a prevalence rate three to five times greater in Indigenous peoples in Canada. The Kahnawake Schools Diabetes Prevention project's (KDSPP) Community Mobilization Training (CMT) engages Indigenous community stakeholders to implement diabetes prevention strategies rooted in enhancing physical activity, healthy eating, and positive attitudes. Through the five-day CMT, the community representatives learn to tailor a prevention strategy to the context and culture of their local community.
My research is investigating the integration of an e-health component to compliment the CMT and provide trainees with ongoing engagement and support. E-health is described as the delivery or augmentation of health (promotion) services through use of information communication technologies. One key strategy planned is the used of webinars (virtual seminars), with topics based on community needs. Other strategies include social media platforms, web-meetings, and chatrooms. These strategies constitute a knowledge translation framework consistent with Indigenous knowledge and communication systems (i.e. storytelling).
Our experiences will contribute to the fields of e-health strategies and Indigenous health, providing what we learned from the process and evaluation of these strategies in an Indigenous community-based context. Most importantly, we will be improving support for Indigenous trainees and enhancing potential for program sustainability."

Hospitals are starting to address these needs by providing special services. Questions remain, however, about how well such services meet the needs of patients, and what barriers can get in the way. In Quebec, language can be a barrier to accessing healthcare, especially among the minority of English speakers.

Our research focuses on the needs of oral cancer patients, who often face considerably difficulties in coping with the debilitating consequences of the disease, such as disfiguration, or difficulty eating in public. Using a series of three research projects, we will follow the progress of English- and French-speaking oral cancer survivors navigating recovery: from screening for referral to support services, to patients' distress, their perceptions of their needs, their understanding of what help is available, and what might make the system better. We will use data analysis of screening and referrals, as well as interviews with patients and their caregivers, to understand the situation holistically.

By the end of our research program, we aim to propose tailored solutions to address barriers to access for both language groups in Quebec."
Intersectionality and the social and structural determinants of health: a mixed methods study exploring the experiences of Black Canadians with type 2 diabetes,"['Iduye, Damilola']",['N/A'],"['Black Health', 'Social Determinants Of Health', 'Structural Determinants Of Health', 'Type 2 Diabetes']",150000.0,474445,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the fastest-growing global health emergencies of the 21st century, with a disproportionately high prevalence rate in Black Canadian populations. In Canada, Black adults have more than six times the prevalence rate of T2D than their White counterparts. Evidence suggests that Black people experience social and health disparities embedded in larger historical, geographical, sociocultural, economic, and political contexts. Most importantly, racism and discrimination ingrained in socially constructed structures impacting Black people can result in poorer health outcomes. Despite the efforts to address the health and social inequities facing Black people, little is known about how broader social contexts shape Black Canadians' health in relation to T2D. Therefore, the proposed study will address this gap by exploring how broader social structures and systems intersect to shape the experiences of T2D in Black Canadian populations. A sample of 300 adults with T2D from Halifax and Toronto will be invited to participate in a survey. Then, up to 30 adults who completed the survey will be interviewed to better understand how broader social structures and systems intersect to shape the experience of Black Canadians with T2D and elicit recommendations for culturally appropriate T2D prevention and care. This study will inform the development of interventions and resources intended to address the social and structural factors that impact Black Canadians living with T2D. Specifically, the findings will provide insights into the development and implementation of equity-informed policies and interventions by healthcare providers and policy decision-makers that are aimed at combating the increasing burden of T2D in this population."

Incident HIV rates in Manitoba are consistently higher than national averages. Women and people who identify as Aboriginal are significantly over-represented in HIV cases. Heterosexual transmission continues to be the primary mode of transmission. Late presentation to care is also an alarming reality. Rural, northern, and remote communities in Manitoba face critical challenges related to HIV prevention, support, and care: isolation, lack of services, and significant HIV rates pose barriers to an effective HIV response. Of immediate importance are recent cluster outbreaks of HIV in three remote northern communities. 

The 595 Prevention Team is a Manitoba-wide organization that works with Peers, network members, policy makers, community leaders, and academics to make recommendations about the development, implementation, and evaluation of prevention initiatives focused on sexually transmitted and blood borne infections. Building on recent successes in Peer-led HIV CBR, the 595 seeks to expand HIV Prevention CBR to more diverse locations in Manitoba, where community members have expressed an interest in HIV CBR, and where priority at risk populations have been identified.

This planning grant is specifically requesting funding to host a two-day meeting with key stakeholders from three distinct rural, northern and remote areas of Manitoba. These stakeholders will meet in Winnipeg to network with each other, to engage in capacity building about CBR, to discuss how HIV affects their communities, and to develop the key components of what will become a collaborative CIHR operating grant proposal. Further, individuals who participate in this capacity building and planning meeting will return to their home communities to be CBR resources for others in their geographic regions, and further collaborate as a Rural, Northern and Remote HIV CBR Network."

We hope to build this relationship through the development of a comprehensive proposal and piloting the research project. Peer delivery of prevention information on sexually transmitted and blood borne infections (STBBIs) within and between drug using networks is considered best practice for engaging, educating, and treating this particular sector. Most research to date involves formal sources of information delivered by peers, which includes recruiting, training, and supporting peer leaders in delivering STBBI prevention education within their networks. Research exploring the informal delivery of information is limited and sparse. Researchers have found that friends, acquaintances, partners, club buddies, and dealers can all be sources of informal information. Further research is needed to understand the how, where, and why information is passed from peer to peer within social networks. The community based research project that we are proposing will explore the informal delivery of STBBI prevention education by peers and expand on the current body of research. Members of the 595 Peer Working Group (595PWG) (a network of community members providing direction to the organization) will be recruited to participate in the project through one or more interviews. A total of 30 face to face interviews will be conducted, including one time only or up to three times. This process will allow us to get a closer proximity to more immediate communication activities undertaken by the participants.

Study findings emphasized that reclaiming food systems and moving toward Indigenous food sovereignty (IFS), land access and cultural revitalization will contribute to the overall wellness and sustainable health goals of the urban Indigenous community during COVID and support long-term recovery. The goal of the project is to share and action knowledge from the Cost of COVID study. We will do this by supporting IFS and building skills and awareness around cultural protocols, self-care and well-being. The key objectives are: 1) To develop, implement, and evaluate strengths-based, Indigenous community-led COVID -19 pandemic recovery solutions to increase IFS, food security, and community belonging using land- and language-based activities rooted in Indigenous languages and cultures, and 2) To improve mental health among the Indigenous community during COVID-19 pandemic recovery using culturally grounded, land-based activities. The knowledge mobilization program will include culturally grounded and socially supportive activities: 1) community foraging during forest walks; 2) growing medicines in community gardens and 3) working together to build Personal Bundles. The Indigenous Diabetes Health Circle (IDHC), Queen's University, and the Kingston Indigenous Languages Nest (KILN) have partnered to move the evidence from the Cost of Covid study into practice.

Syndemics theory delineates a framework which examines the interplay of multiple co-occurring diseases or psychosocial health problems. Exploring the interplay of psychosocial risk factors for HIV transmission can help to improve upon current HIV prevention programming. Recent literature on syndemics theory, HIV, and MSM has described the relationship between psychosocial problems and HIV vulnerability and how intertwining psychosocial problems propagate HIV incidence and prevalence rates. The objective of the study is to assess the extent to which multiple psychosocial health problems have an additive effect on HIV vulnerability among MSM in Canada. Data will be collected via 400 MSM in Toronto. Findings from this project will better assist service providers, mental health clinicians and HIV prevention workers in reducing negative sexual health outcomes among MSM."

The gradual loss of central vision, a hallmark of this disease, eventually makes it difficult for people affected with AMD to recognize faces, drive a car and read and write, among other important daily tasks.  AMD is the most common cause of vision loss in developed countries and affects an estimated 8 million people worldwide over the age of 65.  The annual incidence of AMD increases with age from less than 1% in people under the age of 60 years to greater than 5% in people over the age of 80.

There are two forms of AMD: dry and wet. The dry form is more common and affects approximately 90% of people with AMD.  Dry AMD has few symptoms in the early stage and currently vitamin supplementation with high doses of zinc and antioxidants is the only treatment available.  Annual comprehensive dilated eye exams to monitor disease progression are also strongly advised. 

The wet form is considered the advanced form of AMD.  Although less common, affecting 10% of people with AMD, it accounts for approximately 90% of patients with severe vision loss.  If this form of AMD is detected before severe vision loss occurs, it is poIf this form of AMD is detected before severe vision loss occurs, it is possible to slow down or stop the progression of wet AMD.  Treatments include laser therapy and the more common practice of intraocular injections of drugs that inhibit the proliferation of abnormal blood vessel growth (VEGF inhibitors).  The use of the VEGF inhibitors Lucentis (Ranibizumab) or Avastin (Bevacizumab) is now standard of care for the treatment of wet AMD.

Glaucoma: The Silent Thief Of Vision. Understanding Optic Neuropathies and Associated Vision Loss,"['Irrcher, Isabella', 'Campbell, Robert J', 'El-Defrawy, Sherif R', 'Jinapriya, Delan']",['N/A'],"['Blindess', 'Glaucoma', 'Optic Neuropathy', 'Retinal Ganglion Cell Death']",3000.0,236742,"Glaucoma refers to a group of eye diseases that are characterized by damage to the optic nerve at the back of the eye, causing permanent vision loss. It is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide. Disease progression is typically painless and unnoticeable until a significant reduction in vision occurs.  As such,glaucoma is often referred to as the silent thief of vision. 

The exact causes of glaucoma are not well understood. However, several risk factors have been identified including age, family history, and elevated pressure within the eye (intraocular pressure), the latter being the major modifiable risk factor. 

Once an ophthalmologist has given the diagnosis of glaucoma, the typical first line of treatment consists of eye drops to lower the intraocular pressure.  At times, a person may be using multiple different types of drops to effectively lower pressure.  Laser treatment or surgical options are sometimes necessary.  Surgery involves making an alternate drainage system for the fluid in the eye and is usually performed when medications and lasers are inadequate. There is no cure for glaucoma and slowing vision loss in patients with glaucoma requires a dedicated and cooperative effort from the patient and a long term, committed relationship with their eye care professional.

This Café Scientifique will provide an excellent forum to disseminate information regarding the facts about Glaucoma.  It will serve to address a need in the community for patient education on a disease that is largely painless and asymptomatic until significant vision has been permanently lost. 
 
Important questions that will be addressed during the course of the Café will include: What is Glaucoma? What are the different types of Glaucoma? What causes Glaucoma? How is Glaucoma diagnosed? How is Glaucoma treated? Are there new treatment options being developed for Glaucoma?"
Demande de financement pour un café scientifique sur la vaccination,"['Isabelle, Martine']",['N/A'],"['Café Scientifique', 'Discussion', 'Débat', 'Maladies Infectieuses', 'Recherche En Santé', 'Santé Publique', 'Vaccination']",3000.0,263410,"Le Centre d'interprétation des biosciences Armand-Frappier, connu sous le nom de Musée Armand-Frappier, propose, dans le cadre de sa troisième série de cafés scientifiques et de sa programmation spéciale 2012 portant sur l'immunologie, un événement sur le thème de la vaccination. Chaque automne, à l'aube des campagnes de vaccination contre la grippe, ce sujet revient dans l'actualité et interpelle grandement la population, qui se sent concernée par ce dernier puisqu'elle alors confrontée à un choix. Il en est de même lorsque des parents doivent choisir si leur enfant se fera vacciner ou non contre la rougeole ou encore, lors qu'un voyageur décide de se faire immuniser ou non avant son départ à l'étranger. Ce café scientifique permettra au public d'apprendre que l'incidence des maladies infectieuses infantiles a chuté de manière significative dans la seconde moitié du 20e siècle et a permis d'augmenter l'espérance de vie. Les programmes de vaccination y ont sans aucun doute contribué, pourtant, certains demeurent sceptiques à l'égard l'usage des vaccins, de leur efficacité, et surtout, de leur innocuité. Qu'en est-il vraiment? Quel rôle jouent les médias dans ce dossier ? Plus de sensibilisation devrait-elle être effectuée? Quel avenir pour la vaccination ? Y a-t-il de nouveaux vaccins en développement dans les laboratoires? Les experts et le public discuteront de ces questions et de bien d'autres lors de cette soirée."
The Value of HPV Genotyping in Cervical Cancer Screening,"['Isidean, Sandra D']",['N/A'],"['Cancer Screening', 'Cervical Cancer', 'Epidemiology', 'Human Papillomavirus']",105000.0,257459,"It is now well established that human papillomavirus (HPV) is a necessary cause of cervical cancer and the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide. Additionally, most sexually active women will acquire HPV infection in their lifetime. While the vast majority of these infections will be transient, a fraction of them will become persistent and may lead to pre-cancerous lesions. Detection of these lesions through screening is critical to the prevention of cervical cancer. While screening approaches have largely relied on Papanicolaou cytology (i.e., the Pap test), molecular techniques detecting HPV DNA have shown greater sensitivity in identifying cervical cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). However, the value of qualitatively defining HPV genotypes in cervical specimens, in addition to determining HPV positivity, remains unclear. In an attempt to better prioritize case management and inform risk stratification procedures, we plan to examine whether determining the HPV genotype (via a PCR assay) in cervical specimens helps predict current and future risk of high-grade CIN in primary screening more accurately than simply testing for HPV infection with oncogenic types (via the Hybrid Capture 2 test). This study will use data and samples gathered from the Canadian Cervical Cancer Screening Trial (CCCaST), a CIHR-funded randomized controlled trial that compared the relative efficacy of HPV and Pap testing in primary screening for cervical cancer precursors in Montreal and St. John's, Canada. The proposed study will generate new knowledge regarding the value of HPV DNA testing in primary care screening, and assist the formulation of evidence-based practice guidelines for cervical cancer screening in Canada and elsewhere."
Describing and predicting the burden of multimorbidity in children and adolescents in Canada,"['Itanyi, Ijeoma U']",['N/A'],"['Adolescents', 'Canada', 'Children', 'Determinants', 'Machine Learning', 'Multimorbidity', 'Prediction', 'Prevalence']",150000.0,474444,"An estimated 33 percent of Canadians live with multimorbidity, with an increasing population prevalence over time, evident across all age groups. Multimorbidity is associated with more complex healthcare plans, poorer health outcomes, and excess mortality. Increasing rates of multimorbidity place a greater burden on the health system, affected individuals, and their caregivers. Although research evidence shows that early-life factors are associated with adult multimorbidity, very few Canadian studies have investigated multimorbidity among children and adolescents. Therefore, my proposed project will determine the burden of multimorbidity and predict the future risk of multimorbidity in children and adolescents living in Ontario, Canada. For the proposed project, I will use link administrative and electronic medical records data of children and adolescents 19 years or older living in Ontario. I will estimate the prevalence of multimorbidity among all participants, and by sex, non-binary gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and migration status, using traditional statistical methods, to provide a comprehensive analysis of the burden of multimorbidity. I will use multivariable logistic regression to examine sociodemographic factors associated with multimorbidity in this subpopulation. I will use supervised learning with training, validation, and testing datasets to predict the future risk of multimorbidity. My proposed project has the potential to generate the evidence needed to guide primary prevention efforts to reduce the burden of multimorbidity, reduce future health costs, guide population health planning and ultimately improve population health."
Copy number variants analysis in hypertension and its associated metabolic components,"['Ivanga, Mahine']",['N/A'],"['Bioinformatics', 'Complex Traits', 'Copy Number Variation', 'Epidemiology Genetics', 'Genotyping Arrays', 'High Blood Pressure', 'Human Genomics', 'Metabolic Syndrome', 'Molecular Biology', 'Polymorphisms']",19000.0,174634,"Hypertension is a disease with increasing frequency in western as well as in transition-economy countries. As many genetic and environmental factors participate and interact in the development of hypertension, the identification of genes involved in altered blood pressure regulation is rather complicated. New genome-wide scanning methodologies enable the detection of larger-sized variability in genomes such as Copy Number Variant (CNV) which represents change (gain or loss) in copy number of DNA fragments of at least 1 KB compared to the reference genome, often resulting in an increase or decrease of the gene product. Although DNA copy number variation phenomenon has been known for a long time, it has only recently been reported to be widely present in the human genome, potentially accounting for important source of variation in genomic components of complex traits like blood pressure. Some CNVs have already been shown to be involved in disease such as Parkinson, Alzheimer, autism or HIV-1 infection susceptibility. The present study aims to investigate, using Affymetrix DNA Mapping arrays, genome-wide characteristics of CNVs in unique set of 75 French-Canadian families (from Saguenay-Lac St-Jean region of Quebec) affected by hypertension. In combination with available data on hundreds of rigorously acquired blood pressure, body composition and metabolic traits and complete annotation of the ancestry back to 17th century, we plan to identify CNVs linked to or associated with hypertension and related metabolic abnormalities and conferring risk for or protection from this disease. Hence, this project will contribute to elucidate the role of CNVs as hereditary component of hypertension, and, for the first time, to analyze in depth their familial transmission in uniquely disposed cohorts. The identification of pathogenic CNVs will help to elaborate tools for early diagnosis and targeted prevention strategies."
Evaluating the implementation and effectiveness of British Columbia's risk mitigation prescribing guidelines as a response to the dual overdose and COVID-19 public health emergencies,"['Ivsins, Andrew']",['N/A'],"['Covid-19', 'Drug Use', 'Harm Reduction', 'Opioids', 'Overdose', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Stimulants']",135000.0,440488,"Canada is experiencing two intersecting public health emergencies: an overdose crisis driven by illicitly manufactured fentanyl and fentanyl-adulterated drugs, and the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has compounded the overdose crisis, as overdose fatalities have increased since the pandemic began. Pandemic safety protocols (social distancing, self-isolation, quarantine) put people who use drugs at greater risk of overdose, withdrawal, and other harms related to the increasingly toxic drug supply. In response, British Columbia implemented risk mitigation prescribing guidelines, which allow physicians and nurse practitioners to prescribe pharmaceutical alternatives (e.g., hydromorphone, Dexadrine) to illicit or street-acquired opioids and stimulants. These guidelines are intended to support people who use drugs to socially-distance and self-isolate in order to prevent COVID-19 infection, transmission and community spread, while also reducing overdose, withdrawal, and other drug use-related risk. I will undertake a qualitative study to evaluate the implementation, uptake, and effectiveness of the guidelines targeting individuals at high fatal overdose and COVID-19 risk. The study will also examine prescriber perspectives on the program, and how these shape program implementation, access, and use. Additionally, I will explore socio-structural and geographic factors that shape people's access to and use of the intended pharmaceutical medications. Data collection will involve qualitative interviews with people who have obtained, or tried to obtain, a prescription for stimulants or opioids during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is an urgent need for national expansion of programs that reduce overdose and COVID risk, as jurisdictions across Canada grapple with these dual public health emergencies. Findings from the study will help inform public health approaches to addressing the unique needs of structurally vulnerable people who use drugs at high overdose risk."
Life After Acute Myocardial Infarction in Younger Adults: A Study of the Role of Sex and Gender in Health Related Quality of Life.,"['Izadnegahdar, Mona']",['N/A'],"['Acute Myocardial Infarction In Younger Adults', 'Health Related Quality Of Life', 'Improvement Of Clinical Outcomes', 'Longitudinal Analysis', 'Multi-Centre Study', 'Prospective Study', 'Psychosocial Factors', 'Seattle Angina Questionnaire', 'Sex And Gender', 'Web-Based Data Collection']",105000.0,184405,"Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) is the patient's perception of how their disease affects physical, mental and social aspects of their life.  It has been shown that HRQL can be significantly impaired following any cardiac event and that lower HRQL contributes to increased risk of complications and death in cardiac patients.  However, all such studies have left out a very important group of cardiac patients, namely those less than 55 years of age.  In British Columbia, each year, more than 1000 patients under the age of 55 years have heart attack.  In particular, women in this age group have very poor prognosis and are at higher risk of death compared to men in the same age group.  This difference is not explained by traditional cardiac risk factors such as severity of the disease.  Whether or not having lower HRQL explains the poor prognosis of women in this age group has not been studied.  

As a first step towards addressing this knowledge gap, we will examine HRQL in adults<55 years of age, taking into account the interconnected role of the sex driven (i.e. biological and physiological) and gender driven (i.e. psychosocial, behavioral)characteristics involved in shaping HRQL.  Using several questionnaires we will measure HRQL as well as clinical and psychosocial factors, such as stress, depression, social support and family responsibility which have all been shown to have impact on the recovery process.  

The objectives of the study are to:
1) Measure the difference in HRQL between women and men < 55 yrs, at the time they are admitted for a heart attack and also examine how their HRQL changes over the first 12 months; 
2) Determine which clinical and psychosocial factors influence HRQL and how these factors differ between men and women.

This study will provide new knowledge about HRQL in heart attack patients<55 yrs. The findings will also inform the new development of better strategies for support and treatment of these patients."
The experience of loneliness in older adults living in a retirement community,"['Jackson, Alexandra N']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],800.0,382961,"Older adults are known to experience feelings of loneliness with decline in health, and loss of loved-ones, and proximal relationships. Leisure physical activity is a modifiable behaviour that with regular participation improves quality of life and increases one's life-space mobility. Life-space is the spatial area of which you move about in your daily life; and improvements can provide older adults with non-contrived access to the socio-culture of a retirement community reducing feelings of loneliness. Current research has not yet demonstrated this interaction among residents living in a retirement community setting, nor has it explored an innovative mobile device application. The objective of the proposed study is to explore leisure physical activity and loneliness in the 'day-to-day' life of older adults living in a retirement community to emphasize the need for a mobile device application used my staff and residents to keep track of community recreation programming. The methodological approach for this study will be phenomenology, which is the art and science of exploring phenomena. Participants will be recruited as both men and women aged 65+, who participate, at least 3 times weekly, in leisure physical activity. Gatekeepers, a trusted employee of the retirement community, will be a means for recruiting participants for 2 one-hour interviews over a 6-month period. An interview guide will be designed with questions to elicit stories of participants' experiences with loneliness, leisure physical activity and the concept of life-space mobility. For example, ""Tell me about a typical day for you?"" The present study would demonstrate the need for a technological application for use via mobile device to assist in providing meaningful engagement, allowing them to increase their life-space mobility beyond their individual rooms and an accessible way to re-explore and re-engage in the 'day-to-day' things they enjoy and remember."

Forced to grow up almost overnight, these youth are left to navigate complex social services with minimal guidance and structured supports. This abrupt transition to independence is associated with poor physical, social, and mental health; however, the chronic effects of such adversities remain under-explored. Further information is needed to uncover how challenges and barriers experienced by this population affect longterm development and success. 

The purpose of this mixed-methods study is to understand how youth aging out of foster care navigate the transition to adulthood, and how adversities faced during this period may influence mental health and resilience. Approximately 100-150 youth ages 18-25 from across Canada will be recruited for this study. All participants will receive an electronic questionnaire capturing demographic information, foster care experiences, and transition outcomes. This quantitative data will be compared and analyzed to determine associations among participant characteristics. A subsample of 20-30 youth will then be selected to take part in virtual interviews exploring subjective transition experiences using a qualitative interpretive description approach. Integration of quantitative and qualitative data will aid in the identification of participants who have demonstrated resilience in response to adversity, leading to the discovery of internal and external factors that serve as barriers and facilitators to resilience in this population. Study findings may also reveal opportunities for tailored and proactive mental health care that reflects the unique psychosocial needs of these vulnerable youth. Future research in this area may lead to clinical, policy, and legislative reform that improves mental health outcomes and reduces barriers to societal participation among youth aging out of foster care in Canada."
Harm reduction within mainstream services: What are the challenges and opportunities to reducing the harms for people who use illicit drugs?,"['Jackson, Lois A']","['Campbell, Samuel G', 'Dykeman, Margaret C', 'Fraser, John R', 'Gahagan, Jacqueline C', 'Jahn, Claudia F', 'Karabanow, Jeff']","['Harm Reduction', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Illicit Drugs', 'Injection Drug Use', 'Policy']",258639.0,193174,"Currently across Atlantic Canada, a number of harm reduction options exist for people who use drugs (defined as the use of any drug in ways other than as medically directed, including different forms of consumption). Many of these services (e.g., needle exchanges) are provided by community-based organizations. A key component of harm reduction involves referring people who use drugs to mainstream health and social services such as emergency shelters and emergency departments. These mainstream services are central to meeting the complex physical, social and mental health needs of drug users, just as they are to all Canadians. However, in some cases these mainstream services cannot meet the needs of people who use drugs because of existing policies (e.g., no syringes allowed in shelters).  People who use drugs have also reported sometimes feeling stigmatized by professionals/service workers, and such feelings may stop them from seeking critical help and care. 

Our proposed community-based research project, developed with community organizations, policy makers, physicians, researchers, and people who use drugs, has three key objectives:1)To understand the types of harm reduction policies and practices (formal and informal ) that currently exist (if at all) within emergency shelters and emergency departments in urban and rural areas across Atlantic Canada; 2) To explore with staff/managers working in these mainstream services the types of harm reduction policies and services that they think would be implemented in these settings (if any), as well as the challenges to providing different services; and 3) To discuss with key stakeholders the challenges, opportunities and strategies for implementing /augmenting harm reduction policies and practices in emergency shelters and emergency departments in both urban and rural areas through a series of pan-Atlantic Canada workshops. Findings from Objectives #1 and #2 will also be presented at the workshops."

Research has shown that social support can alleviate stress, which in turn promotes mental well-being and overall health. In adulthood, our most significant social relationships are often our romantic relationships. Indeed, the romantic partner is generally the first person one turns to when needing reassurance and support during a stressful time. Although the link between partner support and stress is fairly well understood among heterosexual couples, very little is known about how it manifests itself in sexual and gender minority couples. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ+) people experience stigma and particular stressors that have well documented impacts on their stress response. In addition, LGBTQ+ people may be more vulnerable to attachment difficulties (i.e. struggle in the way they relate to others and form close bonds) because of past experiences of discrimination. The objective of this study is to evaluate how partner support is associated with the stress hormone cortisol response in cisgender heterosexual and LGBTQ+ couples. Participants will complete questionnaires relating to attachment, partner support, sexual orientation, and gender identity. They will then be exposed to a stress paradigm called the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), in which they will be asked to perform an oral presentation and mental arithmetic in front of a jury. Before, during, and after being exposed to the TSST, their stress response (i.e., their cortisol levels) will be recorded.  Participants will benefit from their partner's support before and after facing the stressor. This study will help us better understand how the body responds to stress depending on one's sexual orientation, biological sex, and gender identity. It will also help determine what role romantic attachment may play on diverse couples' stress response."

This collaboration means that research participants work alongside researchers to design, implement and analyse research that affects them. An assumption exists that participatory research enhances the health of populations because it increases the probability that health knowledge produced from the research will be adopted by the population and that the research will be more relevant to the needs of the people. The present study investigates that assumption by interviewing 30 lead investigators of participatory research projects to uncover critical issues in measuring the effectiveness of participatory research. The outcome will be a research instrument that will help academics, decision-makers, and community leaders better understand and assess the benefits of participatory research."

Although the tobacco use rate has substantially gone down in the general population, significant differences exist between sub-populations in Canada, where for example Ottawa's highly vulnerable People Who Use Drugs (PWUD), homeless or at-risk for homelessness population has a 96% tobacco smoking rate relative to 9-18% in the rest of Ottawa. This stark inequity in tobacco use translates into devastating healthcare outcomes such as a disproportionate amount of cancer, stroke, heart disease and death. In order to tackle tobacco related health disparities, a novel approach to smoking cessation in vulnerable populations is required. Despite commonly held dogma that the PWUD and homeless populations does not want to quit smoking, many studies have demonstrated that in fact they are very interested in quitting. Pragmatic peer-led community-based approaches have demonstrated that tobacco dependence strategies can be implemented with great success in this population. The Healthy People Initiative (HPI) aims to compare two tobacco dependence management strategies in the homeless (or at-risk for homelessness) multi-drug use population in two large Canadian cities, Ottawa and Toronto."
Applying proteomics and genomics to study the physiological effects of gluten,"['Jamnik, Joseph']",['N/A'],"['Celiac Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Gene-Diet Interactions', 'Genomics', 'Gluten', 'Proteomics']",105000.0,347961,"Gluten is a protein found in foods containing wheat, barley or rye. Individuals who are intolerant to gluten experience a number of adverse health effects, including gastrointestinal discomfort, skin rashes, and respiratory problems after consuming gluten containing foods. Celiac disease represents the most severe form of gluten intolerance, and individuals with this disorder experience gluten-induced intestinal damage that results in poor nutrient absorption. There is a strong genetic component to celiac disease, with up to 99% of those diagnosed possessing specific versions of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes. Individuals with celiac disease must follow a strict gluten-free diet, however, most cases of celiac disease are undiagnosed. Gluten sensitivity in the absence of celiac disease is thought to exist, but the development and genetic basis of such a condition remains unknown and there are currently no dietary recommendations for gluten intake in the absence of celiac disease. Recent advances in the field of proteomics, the large-scale study of protein function at the whole body level, have made it possible to identify new markers of health that will enable us to understand the biological effects of gluten consumption and potential gluten sensitivity. My research focuses on investigating the biological effects of gluten intake and identifying undiagnosed cases of celiac disease. I will analyze data from two comprehensive databases that contain information on dietary and lifestyle habits, genetics, gluten intake and proteomics. I will also examine how genetic variation in HLA and other genes affects the relationship between gluten intake and proteins involved in several physiological pathways. This research will improve our understanding of the biological effects of gluten intake, the prevalence of undiagnosed celiac disease, and will result in the development of evidence-based dietary recommendations for gluten intake."

This is especially the case in low-to-middle income countries (LMICs) where mining development is subject to less regulatory scrutiny and can produce greater levels of social disruption, and economic and health inequities, than is the case in high income settings. Researchers and affected communities in Canada, particularly First Nations and Aboriginal communities, have become well educated about the impacts - direct and indirect, short and long-term -- of economic activities such as mining development.  Canadian interests in developing knowledge about population health impacts of mining extend beyond its own borders: Canada is home to a majority of international mining companies, and has a significant presence in Asia, Central America, and Southern Africa.  Since 2005, there has been a growing dialogue about corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the Canadian mining sector, which resulted in a 2007 ""Canadian CSR Framework"" that noted a need for higher standards for ""environmental and social assessments"".  However, there has been relatively little work that has examined how policymakers in LMICs work with mining companies and NGOs to identify and mitigate the social and health costs of resource extraction. 

To address these realities, the purpose of this planning project is to bring together key academics, private consulting groups, and policymakers in Canada, and in three countries where Canadian companies are prominent in the minerals sector, to contribute their expertise to the development a larger project to evaluate international efforts to address the potentially adverse social and health consequences of mineral resource development.  Our initial focus will be in three countries where Canadian researchers have worked closely with the mining sector:  Ecuador, Zambia, and Mongolia."

In 2015, HBV-related complications accounted for 66% of viral hepatitis-related deaths worldwide. Large proportions of people living with chronic  HBV may be unaware of their infections due to the asymptomatic nature of the early phases of the disease, and may get diagnosed once they develop symptoms during advanced stages of the illness. Thus, screening is essential for early diagnosis of HBV infection, and for timely linkage with care and treatment initiation to slow disease progression. Groups facing the greatest burden of disease from HBV in Canada include persons immigrating from HBV-endemic countries in East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Sub-Saharan Africa, where HBV is highly prevalent (HBsAg: ~6.2%-10.5%), unimmunized people who inject drugs, gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, and Indigenous Peoples. Immigrants in Canada may be diagnosed and linked with care late in the course of their infections and, consequently, have an increased risk of hospitalization for complications related to HBV. Canada has committed to reducing HBV incidence and HBV-related mortality by 95% and 65%, respectively, by 2030 but is lacking national and provincial action plans for HBV elimination. These action plans would require measurable indicators of hepatitis-related services for progress tracking and program evaluation. Comprehensive population-level HBV data are necessary for the creation of care cascades and other tools for program planning and evaluation but are currently unavailable for HBV in British Columbia. This project aims to provide a detailed understanding of the epidemiology of HBV in British Columbia by developing a comprehensive, dynamic, population-level integrated dataset comprised of linked laboratory and administrative data to support the mapping of a current HBV care cascade and to highlight areas for improvement in the continuum of care in BC."

The percentage of children who enter kindergarten with an impairment or a special health need (ISHN) that impact their ability to function in the classroom has been increasing in the last decade. In Ontario, education and health data are kept separate, which means we know very little about the children who are identified as having an ISHN in school, and even less whether - and why -  they have or have not been identified prior to school entry by any health professional. How many of these children have been identified early? Who are the children who have not? Are there certain things that might predict early identification? In order to answer these questions, we are proposing a study in which we bring the health and education population-level data together for children born in 2009 who attended kindergarten in publicly-funded schools in Ontario in 2015. We matched kindergarten teachers' reports of children's development and their ISHN using the Early Development Instrument (EDI), collected in the second half of the 2014/2015 school year, with health data from ICES (formerly called the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences). This study will take an important step towards helping us understand why some children with early health problems start school without being flagged in the healthcare system, thus missing an opportunity to benefit from early intervention."

Many of these resources and supports were closed or became disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, and the impact of these disruptions on young children's development is unknown. This study will look at the development of kindergarten children attending schools in 2021/22, using the Early Development Instrument (EDI), a teacher-completed checklist of children's physical, socioemotional, and cognitive development. EDI data have been regularly collected across Canada in most provinces and territories since 2004. These data have been linked with neighbourhood socioeconomic status (SES) data from Census and Taxfiler databases. The goal of our study is to see whether the development of 5-year-old children attending kindergarten in 2022 differs from the development of children who attended kindergarten before the COVID-19 pandemic. We want to know whether COVID-19 may have caused changes in children's development, and whether these changes vary between places where children live and between different groups of children (e.g. based on their sex at birth, their first language, family income, and neighbourhood mix of race/ethnicity). Our project will look at different aspects of children's health: physical, mental, and cognitive development, and we will explore whether disruptions in schooling and childcare had an impact on children living in different parts of the country. This study will tell us about the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on kindergarten children's development, which is important for later academic achievement and health. It will provide information to help us identify groups of children who may be at particular developmental risk. Our study will offer timely and specific information to educators, health professionals and governments to help prevent possible long-term negative impacts of the pandemic on young children."

We currently do not know how many children with SHN develop a mental disorder in childhood or adolescence, or whether their early development, combined with individual, family, and neighbourhood factors, impacts their mental health later on. This project will attempt to answer these questions using Early Development Instrument data for all children in kindergarten in publicly-funded schools in Ontario, Manitoba, and British Columbia and connecting that information to administrative health data for these children until 18 years of
age. Our goal is to see how many children identified with a SHN by the time they are in kindergarten have 1 of the 4 most common mental disorders in children and youth: depression, anxiety, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or conduct disorder. We will also examine factors in these children's lives (e.g. their sex/gender, immigration status, family composition and income, neighbourhood income) to find out if they are related to whether a child has a mental disorder. We will also look for differences in the prevalence of mental
disorders in children with SHN by their sex/gender and immigration status. The proposed study has the potential to increase our knowledge about the mental health outcomes of children with SHN and inform practice, programs, and policies in the area of mental disorders for these vulnerable children for whom currently not much is known."

Doing so within each community's unique cultural context will foster empowered and more resilient youth, and result in enhanced overall community wellness. The primary goal of this research is to promote Indigenous youth resilience through increased confidence, capacity, leadership skills, and self-efficacy. It will use a community- and asset-based approach that emphasizes and promotes youth strengths.  This will address the suicide prevention exemplar. The secondary goal is improved health decision-making by youth and other community members through direct engagement in health promotion programs and interventions, and the associated critical reflection on health behaviours. This will address the obesity/diabetes exemplar.  This research is being conducted in partnership between an interdisciplinary group of academic researchers and four rural/urban Alberta First Nation (Frog Lake and Heart Lake First Nations) and Métis communities (Gunn Métis Local 55 and Métis Regional Council - Zone IV of the Métis Nation of Alberta).

Recent research with Indigenous youth on tobacco use, food security and physical activity has shown us that messages developed and delivered by these youth seem to be more trusted and effective for communities in providing information, changing behaviours and promoting healthy lifestyle choices.  The process of developing the messages had further advantages for the youth in getting them to think more about health risks, and in giving them confidence and skills.  This research seeks to further explore and assess the value of messages generated by youth through a participatory process for promoting community health and well-being.  It will be conducted with First Nations, Inuit and Metis communities in different areas of Canada.

Aboriginal students from a remote school in the Northwest Territories and an urban school in Edmonton will develop and produce videos on smoking.  The videos will be uploaded to YouTube, and the best video from each school determined through YouTube voting and a contest in their schools and other Aboriginal schools. Through using a participatory approach for intervention development, and targeting the types of media most accessed by youth, the outcomes of this project have the potential to significantly impact smoking prevention and/or cessation for Aboriginal youth. The longer-term impacts on the youth and their communities will be evaluated. Broad dissemination of the videos and process documentaries provides the opportunity to extend this impact from a local to national/global level.  It will also facilitate knowledge translation about the approach and outcomes that will help improve future programs and policies for Aboriginal youth."

The impact has been particularly severe for South Asian mothers in Canada, who often experienced further stressors such as language barriers, caring for elderly relatives, and transnational economic and social responsibilities. South Asian women and their family members are often at higher risk for contracting COVID-19 as they are more likely to work in employment sectors with greater exposure to the virus. They have also been more severely affected by job loss during the pandemic as they are over-represented in hard-hit industries such as food and accommodation services. Finally, South Asian women have faced increased racial prejudice, often being falsely blamed for the pandemic, (particularly as the Delta variant, initially inappropriately labelled the ""Indian variant"", quickly became a widespread variant of concern).

To date there is limited knowledge on the health, psychosocial and socio-economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on mothers in Canadian South Asian communities, and how these impacts affect their families. We will examine South Asian mothers' COVID-19 experiences (including positive supports) and levels of moral distress using a longitudinal mixed method approach (interviews and questionnaires/surveys). Moral distress is defined as a phenomenon in which a person knows the right action to take, but is constrained from taking it because of barriers beyond their control. The experiences of South Asian mothers during the pandemic potentially contribute to cumulative moral distress. This research will be conducted in the Fraser Health Region of BC. Collaborations with provincial knowledge users and community organization partners will ensure their information needs are met and the resulting recommendations can be readily translated into changes in policy and practice."

Forum Theatre is a form of Theatre of the Oppressed.  It is based on playing games that encourage laughter, trust and cooperation to build a community. The games lead to image creation with participant's bodies to reflect different events in their lives, and these are developed into a play representing conflict and oppression. Through interaction with the play, community members help explore solutions to the conflict. We have been working to Indigenize, decolonize and adapt this method with First Nations and Métis communities. Our priority has been to train community members to independently facilitate Forum Theatre activities in their own communities. Overall Forum Theatre activities have been very effective in engaging youth, building on community strengths and fostering collective wellness. Our goal in this phase is to develop a sustainable process for implementing and evaluating an Indigenized Forum Theatre intervention to Indigenous communities for mental health. We will refine and pilot strategies for implementing Forum Theatre activities that build upon community and individual strengths, such as using on-the-land culture camps, and develop appropriate evaluation measures. Additional interested community members will be trained as facilitators, and partnership(s) developed with educational institutions to formalize our training. We will augment an Indigenous Forum Theatre manual to be used by community facilitators with new activities and languages.

Insomnia is the most prevalent sleep disorder that produces detrimental effects on personal health (increasing one's risk of developing psychological and physical problems) and society at large; contributing a large portion of economic burden in direct (greater health care costs) and indirect (work-related injuries) costs. The specific objective is to examine heart rate variability as a potential pathophysiological underlying mechanism in one's and familial susceptibility to insomnia and related comordities (cardiovascular disease). While there is substantial data on psychological and cognitive risk factors, physiological markers have been less studied. Given the paucity of information in this area, this program has critical implications for population health status and health care utilization, such as the identification of risk factors in the etiology, pathogenesis and treatment of insomnia. This is crucial for the improvements in health and health care (successful preventive and intervention strategies) and is instrumental in generating new knowledge to identify additional biomarkers of the hyperarousal state of insomnia. Using a multidimensional approach, this project is scientifically, clinically, and socially relevant for health outcomes among Canadians with insomnia, as it will promote implementation of new clinical policy (via knowledge translation) and improve optimal health (quality of life) and therapeutic benefits. Further, the research is innovative, timely and will be carried out in one of the largest insomnia research programs in Canada that focuses on non-pharmacological interventions; and thus, will have direct economic implications by reducing the costs and morbidity associated with this debilitating sleep disorder."
Familial Aggregation of Insomnia,"['Jarrin, Denise C']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],500.0,352432,"Insomnia is a prevalent sleep disorder in the general population that produces negative effects on personal health (increased risk of psychological and medical problems) and society (greater health-care costs). The risk of insomnia is higher in individuals with at least one family member also suffering from insomnia than individuals with a family member not suffering from insomnia. To show that insomnia may be explained by genetics, researchers must first show evidence of ""familial aggregation"", that is, show that insomnia tends to ""run"" in families more than what would be expected by chance. This study aimed to examine if familial aggregation of insomnia is greater in biological relatives of individuals with and without insomnia. To see if there were any environmental influences on insomnia, spouses of individuals with and without insomnia also participated in the study. Biological relatives (n=371) and spouses (n=138) completed a survey on the type, severity, and frequency of sleep disturbances to determine if they had or did not have insomnia. Results indicated that biological relatives of individuals with insomnia had a significantly higher risk of also having insomnia than biological relatives of individuals without insomnia, regardless of age and sex. The increased risk of insomnia was particularly higher in siblings of individuals with insomnia than siblings of individuals without insomnia. The risk of insomnia was high in spouses of individuals with insomnia than spouses of individuals without insomnia, but not statistically different. Overall, findings show evidence of strong familial aggregation of insomnia. These results have important implications, as they may be used to better understand insomnia risk factors and to help design more effective treatment and prevention programs for ""at-risk"" people (if related to someone with insomnia). More research is needed to better understand the relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors in insomnia."

As the older population of Canada continues to grow, the number of dementia cases and associated social and economic burdens are anticipated to rise. While the impacts of lifestyle and health status on dementia are largely known, the influence of modifiable environmental exposures is poorly understood.
The aim of this project is to address this research gap and study the relationship between green space and dementia and cognitive function among older adults using data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. I will apply a novel, interdisciplinary research approach to investigate the influence of residential exposure to green space on dementia and cognitive function in older adulthood, including an exploration of potential differences in health associations by green space type. In addition, I will explore possible underlying pathways linking green space exposure to health outcomes, including increased physical activity and social cohesion and reduced stress, noise, and air pollution levels.
Identifying risk factors associated with dementia and cognitive decline is important for preventing morbidity and improving the health of Canada's aging population. This project will acquire new knowledge on the association between green space and dementia and cognitive function among older adults. It will provide novel information on types of green space that may be particularly important for cognitive health and contribute a deeper understanding of pathways underlying green space and health relationships. Results from this project will inform urban planning and public health interventions to improve population health.

The physical activity levels of youth are increased when social support to be active is provided by their parents - this makes targeting parents with health messages appealing. Health messages can be framed in terms of the benefits of engaging in the health behaviour (gain-framed) or the costs of not engaging in the health behaviour (loss-framed). Health messages are most effective when they are framed in the appropriate way. The purpose of this study is to determine which message frame is most effective when creating health messages for parents so that they provide support to their children to be active. The study participants will be parents with at least one child between the ages of 8 and 13. This study will be a randomized controlled trial with three different message framing conditions (gain, loss, and mixed-frame) which will each show a physical activity messaging campaign targeted at parents. Measures will be taken before and after the messaging intervention of the parent's behavioural beliefs, attitudes, intentions, planning and actions taken towards providing social support for their children's physical activity. Groups will be compared using statistical analysis to see which message frame had a larger association with increasing parent social support intentions and behaviours over a 4 week follow-up period. The results from this study, as stated in the purpose, will allow for more effective health messages for parents to be created in order to increase child physical activity and reduce inactivity. Increasing child physical activity will not only benefit their personal health, but will combat the obesity epidemic to benefit our population health as a whole."
Creating Synergy in Women's Maternal and Reproductive Health: Building Global Research Capacity to Eradicate Obstetric Fistula.,"['Jarvis, Kimberly', 'Chubb, Laura A', 'Richter, Magdalena S']","['Salami, Bukola O', 'Tenkorang, Eric Y']",['Global Health'],19998.0,411874,"Obstetric fistula (OF) is a tragic maternal health condition affecting between two to three million women worldwide. OF is a hole between the vagina and bladder and/or rectum which is usually the result of prolonged obstructed labor, where a woman does not have access to adequate obstetric care. When left untreated, the continuous and uncontrollable stream of urine and/or feces from the vagina becomes physically, psychologically and socially insufferable. The circumstances surrounding OF are deeply rooted in gender imparity, inaccessibility of health care services, lack of health education, and harmful cultural practices experienced by women and girls in marginalized communities globally. Failure to acknowledge and address OF as an international health concern violates women's human right to reproductive health care. Canada has already stated its commitment to advancing the rights and health of women and girls around the world at the 2019 Women Deliver Conference. Following on from previous research completed in Ghana where the incidence of OF is high, this proposed project seeks to use a participatory approach to engage stakeholders in composing comprehensive strategies to support global and country-specific needs and policy development for the eradication of OF. Grounded in the work of Habermas (1974), a participatory approach relies on equitable sharing of knowledge and power to enable communities to exercise greater control over their lives and health. The proposal outlines a three-day knowledge exchange workshop bringing together Ghanaian women affected by OF and their families, policy makers, service providers, nongovernmental organizations, women's advocates, and researchers with the goal of creating an action plan or framework towards the prevention and care of OF. An outline of the workshop is included as well as plans for evaluation."
Building Bridges II: Continuing Community Engagement in an Indigenous Health Epidemiology Model,"['Jaworsky, Denise W', 'Nicholson, Valerie']","['Beaver, Kerrigan', 'Benoit, Anita C', 'Benson, Elizabeth L', 'Cardinal, Claudette L', 'Cooper, Curtis L', 'Hogg, Robert S', 'Hull, Mark W', 'Kelly, Deborah V', 'Loutfy, Mona R', 'Pearce, Margo E', 'Price, Roberta', 'Sanche, Stephen E', 'Thomas, Réjean', 'Walmsley, Sharon L', 'Wong, Alexander C']","['Epidemiology', 'Hiv/Aids']",19720.0,392062,"Building Bridges is a multi-site community-based research project that aims to make epidemiology more accessible to Indigenous communities impacted by HIV. In an initial pilot project, this was achieved through applying Indigenous methodology (characterized by recognizing Indigenous worldviews, knowledge, histories and realities as well as privileging Indigenous voices, peoples and lands) to epidemiology using Canadian Observational Cohort (CANOC) collaboration data. CANOC is an integrated network of HIV/AIDS treatment information that includes 11 observational cohort databases across Canada. Among 7,080 CANOC participants who were included in the 2000-2012 dataset, 7% identified as having Indigenous ethnicity. Since that time, CANOC has expanded to include two additional cohorts in Regina and Saskatoon and the total number of participants has increased to 12,805, among whom 9.7% identify as having Indigenous ethnicity. In late 2018, an updated release of CANOC data will present new opportunities to uncover current trends in HIV treatment within key populations, including Indigenous people. As this expanded and updated CANOC data becomes available, supporting Indigenous engagement is essential to ensure study questions and interpretations are relevant to the communities most impacted by the research and conceived in accordance with Indigenous worldviews and ethical standards. We are seeking funds from the CIHR HIV/AIDS Research Initiative Planning & Dissemination Grant to support a program of community engagement that encompasses both the planning and dissemination of epidemiology related to HIV among Indigenous peoples. This project is entitled Building Bridges II: Continuing Community Engagement in an Indigenous Health Epidemiology Model.  We propose a program of engagement including research planning teleconferences, one Voices of Wisdom Retreat, three concurrent writing workshops, and research dissemination teleconferences."
Understanding the Leadership Experience of African Nova Scotian Nurses and the Implications for the Health of the African Nova Scotian Community Using a Black Feminist Lens,"['Jefferies, Keisha H']",['N/A'],"['African Nova Scotian', 'Black Feminist Theory', 'Community Health', 'Inequity', 'Leadership', 'Qualitative']",150000.0,396183,"The purpose of this project is to understand leadership experiences from the perspective of Black nurses in Nova Scotia and how this affects the health of the Black community. This research is timely and necessary as the Black community in Nova Scotia continues to experience tremendous oppression in the form of racism and discrimination. As a result of significant discrimination and racism, Black communities, specifically within Nova Scotia, have much poorer health compared to the rest of Nova Scotia and Canada. Research shows that Black communities in Nova Scotia experience higher rates of high blood pressure, diabetes and mental illness, among other chronic health conditions. Moreover, across Canada, there is a substantial absence of information that shows how diseases and illness affect people based on their race. Nurse leaders are nurses who have skills and knowledge that allow them to influence teams, initiate change and improve our health system. Nurse leaders use their experience and training to inform their actions. However, within the Canadian healthcare system, there is an underrepresentation of Black nurse leaders, which has led to major issues within the Black community being ignored. In order to determine the issues that are present for Black nurses and the community, it is necessary to interview these nurses and learn what issues they view as important. This will inform and direct our approach for improving the health of the Black community. There is very little research that has been done with Black communities in Nova Scotia and as a result, there is not a lot of information available about the community. Therefore, this research will show how race, class and gender impact the leadership of Black nurses and how the underrepresentation of Black nurse leaders is detrimental to the health of the Black community. The information from this research will inform decision-makers, healthcare providers and researchers in their work with the Black community."
Understanding the impact of United States policy spillovers on cancer drug reimbursement decisions internationally,"['Jenei, Kristina']",['N/A'],"['Cancer', 'Decision Making', 'Essential Medicines', 'Global Health', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services Research', 'Health Technology Assessment', 'Low And Middle Income Countries', 'Priority Setting', 'World Health Organization']",105000.0,455218,"To achieve World Health Organization (WHO) Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3.8 for universal health coverage, governments must ensure access to safe, effective, quality, and affordable medicines. It is known that US drug policy decisions ""spill over"" to other countries. Canadian decision-makers have highlighted how the unconstrained US market creates additional pressure to expand access to medications with marginal benefit. The problem with US policy spillover is that there has been a long-documented decline of regulatory standards, where medicines are often approved without robust supporting evidence. Despite the importance of understanding cross-border influences, little is known about how US policies impact regulatory decisions abroad. It is hypothesized that US policies negatively impact other countries by creating pressure to expand access to drugs with unproven benefits, while increasing prices from a decentralized, non-price controlled market, therefore constraining public health care systems abroad. This study will involve a two-phased, mixed-methods approach utilizing an international survey, quantitative modelling, and document review.  First, a cross-sectional survey will be developed to elicit perspective from decision-makers internationally. The second aim of this survey is to identify two countries for an in-depth case study. Quantitative modelling (time series analysis) will measure the impact of US cancer drug approvals on reimbursement decisions. To contextualize these findings, a document review of existing policies and literature will also be conducted. 
This research will provide an important evaluation of US pharmaceutical policy in foreign countries. By quantifying potential policy spillovers, countries will understand influences on domestic health systems. This information is vital to ensure medicines reimbursed reflect population needs and scarce resources are allocated to high-value therapeutics to improve cancer outcomes worldwide."
Innovative Knowledge Translation Methodologies and Interventions to Enhance Youth Mental Health,"['Jenkins, Emily K']",['N/A'],"['Community Health', 'Effectiveness Studies', 'Focus Groups', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Mental Health Promotion', 'Mixed Methods', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Interviews', 'Social Network Analysis', 'Survey Research']",5000.0,258864,"In recent years, the importance of effectively sharing research findings with knowledge users (e.g. practitioners, general public, policy makers), a process termed knowledge translation, has been identified as a priority and viewed as critical to improving health outcomes. However, most of the research in this area has focused on developing strategies to share clinically relevant knowledge, with inadequate attention given to the needs of those seeking to improve population-level health outcomes through work in community settings. This study will address this knowledge gap through the development and assessment of an innovative strategy aimed at sharing research findings to target what the World Health Organization has recently identified as the most significant health problem facing young people today, mental health issues. This study will utilize Dialogue Workshops, an intervention in which youth and adults are brought together in community settings to discuss contemporary health and social issues. In these Dialogue Workshops, research evidence about youths' experiences of emotional distress (e.g., stress, anxiety, depression) will be shared. It is believed that creating a venue for youth and adults to come together to discuss youth's experiences with emotional distress will help to foster connectedness and empathy towards adolescents' experiences; two factors shown to promote mental health outcomes in youth. The effectiveness of this intervention will be assessed using novel research techniques to track the spread of knowledge gained through participation in the Dialogue Workshops within the community. Additionally, factors that foster mental health will be measured. This study will contribute new understandings and guidance for those involved in community-based knowledge translation and will provide evidence for a strategy aimed at promoting the mental health of Canadian youth."

To more effectively address this issue, children's mental health leaders argue for a public health approach including promotion, prevention and treatment within a ""healthy public policy"" framework. However, while advances have been made in prevention and treatment, promotion has yet to receive sufficient attention. This study will address critical gaps in children's mental health policy in Canada. Collaborative research approaches will be used in British Columbia and Alberta study sites to engage young people to: 1) enhance understanding of the factors influencing children's mental health; 2) build children's capacity to engage in policymaking processes; 3) develop a testable framework for collaborative policymaking with young people; and 4) explore feasibility of proposed approach. Mixed methods incorporating qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis will ensure a comprehensive approach to addressing study objectives. This study will address Canada's children's mental health shortfalls - by contributing new evidence on processes for engaging young people  in developing new policies to promote children's mental health outcomes."
Creation and implementation of the adverse childhood experiences knowledge translation hub (ACEs KT-hub): Health service delivery improvement through the adoption of evidence-based practices and trauma-informed care,"['Jenkins, Serena']",['N/A'],"['Adverse Childhood Experiences', 'Evidence-Based Practice', 'Health Policy', 'Implementation Science', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Systematic Review', 'Trauma-Informed Care']",108500.0,484644,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) increase the prevalence of mental and physical illness in the population. Since this association was identified in the 1990's, thousands of studies have explored the range of outcomes and the numerous moderating factors, such as sex, age, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity. Although it is well known among the scientific community that ACEs are potent determinants of health, there has not been large scale implementation of this science into medical policy or practice. Several reasons exist for this discrepancy. Research can be notoriously difficult to access due to subscription-based publishing and scientific jargon. Once accessible, a lack of agreement among results of different studies can make developing policies and practices based on the research challenging. Therefore, to address these issues and increase the adoption of evidence-based practices concerning ACEs into health policy and practice, my proposed project consists of the development and implementation of the ACEs Knowledge Translation Hub (ACEs KT-hub) in Alberta Health Services (AHS), guided by the Knowledge-to-Action Framework. The ACEs KT-hub will be a living synthesis of ACEs research that allows the rapid curation of studies on a particular topic and will provide health practitioners and policymakers with resources that succinctly communicate the science of ACEs, such as infographics, as well as systematic reviews and meta-analyses on a variety of topics. We will create the ACEs KT-hub in collaboration with knowledge users, including health leadership, practitioners, policymakers, and individuals with lived experience to ensure that we are addressing priority areas. Implementation of the ACEs KT-hub will be accomplished by leveraging existing networks in AHS to identify champions and will facilitate the development of policy and practice initiatives that reduce the risk of future generations experiencing the toxic effects of ACEs."
Assessing the impact of bloodborne infections and treatment on non-communicable chronic diseases in a population-based cohort,"['Jeong, Dahn']",['N/A'],"['Epidemiology', 'Hepatitis B', 'Hepatitis C', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Non-Communicable Chronic Diseases', 'Population Health', 'Syndemic Infections', 'Treatment Outcomes']",105000.0,418037,"Despite advances in prevention, care and treatment, many people around the world and in Canada suffer from bloodborne infections (BBIs) caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). These infections are not only directly linked to detrimental health outcomes, but are also linked to chronic diseases such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular diseases. The advance in infection care and management has prolonged the life expectancy of people with chronic infections, and in turn, they are now at higher risk of other chronic diseases and complications. Social and health conditions can also accelerate disease progression in people living with BBIs. Currently, the knowledge on the impact of these infections on chronic diseases is limited. The evidence is especially scarce in population-based data accounting for other health, social and environmental factors.

This project aims to study the impact of HBV, HCV and HIV mono- and co-infections on diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular diseases, accounting for social and health conditions. Furthermore, new highly effective and well-tolerated drugs called direct-acting antiviral agents are expected to provide a protective effect in people living with chronic hepatitis C. The project will look at the real-world impact of this drug on reducing the risk of chronic diseases.

This study will use a large population-based data including over 2 million individuals tested for HBV, HCV and HIV in British Columbia (BC), BC Hepatitis Testers Cohort. The cohort is linked with other databases such as chronic disease registry, medical visits, hospitalizations, drug prescriptions and vital statistics. Using this data will allow a comprehensive understanding of the impact of chronic HBV, HCV and HIV infections. Ultimately, the findings of this study will help to create targeted care and disease management strategies for people living with chronic infections."

Poor diet is the largest and most common preventable risk factor for morbidity and premature death, even though the population health and healthcare impact of poor dietary patterns have not been determined. This project aims to measure the burden of chronic diseases (CVD, diabetes, cancer), mortality and healthcare use attributable to unhealthy dietary patterns, and to ""reverse engineer"", i.e. determine from linked morbidity and mortality data, culturally-relevant dietary patterns that provide the greatest health benefits to Canadians. Health and healthcare benefits of various dietary strategies that could be adopted to alter food supply in Canada will also be examined. Mathematical modelling (multivariable, micro-simulation models) will be used to develop the world's most robust population health models to support evidence-based nutrition policy for reducing the health and healthcare burden of poor dietary patterns. This research is possible through the unique Canadian Community Health Survey 2.2 (n=35,107), which is population-based and recently individually linked to >60 health administrative databases, allowing very detailed assessment of health and social outcomes related to nutrition. Policy actors will be involved in model development to ensure that models address questions of real-world policy relevance. Final models will be used to develop risk-assessment tools (health calculators) that can increase awareness of health risks from poor dietary patterns and address a gap in clinical care by allowing more widespread assessment of dietary intakes as part of chronic disease risk assessment and management. The models and supporting data linkages will create a lasting infrastructure and will position Canada as a leader in population health assessment of diet and food policy."

They are the leading causes of early death and are common reasons for hospitalization. In Canada, unhealthy eating, mostly due to a food environment characterized by energy-dense packaged foods, is largely responsible for chronic diseases and early deaths. To address the rising rates of chronic diseases, international health organizations recommend a shift from policies focused on single nutrients to policies targeting multiple food components/nutrients using nutrient profile models (i.e., ""ranking foods based on their nutritional composition for disease prevention""). This project will enable monitoring of health and healthcare impacts of adopting nutrient profile models for regulation of nutrition policies (e.g., front-of-package labelling)-an essential step for reducing diet-related health problems for Canadians. We will evaluate the impact of adopting the most promising nutrient profile models on health outcomes and examine the health and healthcare benefits of strategies to improve the nutritional quality of the food supply. A Canadian-specific nutrient profile model will also be ""reverse engineered"" to equitably reduce health and healthcare burden among Canadians. We will use Canadian national nutrition surveys conducted in 2004 (linked to health and healthcare outcomes) and 2015 (linked to food supply data) to develop a robust model for evaluating the future health and healthcare outcomes of adopting different nutrition policies. The infrastructure we will develop will be unique internationally, enabling timely and detailed evaluation of nutrition policies for reduction of diet-related diseases and healthcare use among different population groups (e.g., sex, age, ethnicity). These models will create a lasting infrastructure and will position Canada as a leader in population health and healthcare assessment of nutrition policies."

Alternatively, people living with chronic physical disability (e.g., arthritis and spinal cord injury) face numerous barriers that challenge their ability to engage in diverse social roles like employment, relationships with others, leisure and community activity, negatively impacting their quality of life. The objective of this investigation aims at facilitating early intervention that would enable people with physical disability to maintain active participation in life. These objectives will be met by examining the psychological, social, and environmental factors that may act as facilitators or barriers to participation and comparing the participation experiences and well-being of individuals with different types of physical disability in terms of the disability's onset (i.e., sudden/gradual) and visibility (visible/invisible). A mixed method approach will be taken. First, qualitative focus groups will be used to help identify issues and themes important to individuals with spinal cord injury and arthritis. 3 focus groups consisting of 8 participants will be conducted for each disability group and content analysis techniques will be utilized to highlight important. Second, a quantitative survey will be conducted to examine the relative importance of the concepts uncovered in the qualitative analysis. The survey will be administered to 250 individuals (n = 125 spinal cord injury; n = 125 arthritis) and factor analysis will be conducted to explore interrelationships among these concepts. The comparative investigation of the proposed populations will provide a deep understanding of the role of participation in the health and well-being of chronic physically disabled populations."

Scholars have identified a dominant 'obesity discourse' in this literature that assumes a link between inactivity, over-eating, obesity and ill health - and often constructs obese people as 'lazy' and a drain upon society (Gard & Wright, 2005). They have also challenged the emergence of new normalizing practices that entreat individuals to regulate their bodies to prevent obesity, mainly by making individual lifestyle changes (i.e., diet, exercise). Pregnancy has recently been identified as a major contributor to obesity in Western society and pregnant bodies have become the object of these normalizing practices. Prenatal exercise has thus taken on new significance and pregnant women are now being encouraged to engage in moderate exercise to prevent overweight/obesity in both the mother and child. Significantly, this advice counters long-standing cautions against exercise during pregnancy, resulting in a potentially confusing and anxiety-arousing situation for expectant women who are already under social pressure to manage a growing number of pregnancy risks. Despite the increased attention to the issue of overweight/obesity during pregnancy, lacking is an investigation of how societal messages on the topic impact the subjectivities and experiences of pregnant Canadian women. We therefore propose to use qualitative interview techniques to explore how 40 women of varying socio-cultural locations (i.e., race, ethnicity, class), and who perceive themselves as having 'weight issues,' discursively construct and experience the body and health. This project promises to aid in the creation of more inclusive health promotion programs and messages, with the goal of increasing pregnant women's emotional and physical health, fostering positive body image and promoting pleasurable physical activity."

During my Master's degree, I would like to investigate the effect an acute bout of passive (no effort) cycling has on executive function. Executive function is an important set of processes involved in control of behavior and is important for everyday living. It is known that older adults experience declines in executive function. Previous research has revealed that passive cycling can result in a post-exercise boost to executive function in healthy young adults. We hypothesize that passive cycling will result in a post-exercise executive function improvement, evident through improved performance on a task evaluating executive function using eye tracking movements.  Passive cycling is an excellent method of exercise to implement in longer-living older populations due to mobility issues that commonly arise with age. The research is significant as it expands our understanding of the processes that lead to executive function improvements, the influence of different types of exercise on cognition in older adults and can further aid in the establishment of interventions that address cognitive decline in longer-living older adults. I believe that attending SPA will aid me with my research project it will expand my understanding of different methodological approaches used in older adult research. It will also enhance my understanding of issues longer-living older adults face, specifically relating to dementia and mobility, and will guide future research I conduct towards addressing these problems."

Nevertheless, progress towards neonatal and child survival in low and middle income countries has been rather slow and mortality rates remain ten fold greater than the rates observed in higher income countries. In India, efforts to reduce child mortality have intensified recently. The National Rural Health Mission of the Government of India has initiated several interventions to increase child survival. Efforts have also been made to monitor India's maternal and child health indicators using large scale surveys. This research proposal will leverage the work of the Registrar General of India in collaboration with the Centre for Global Health Research that is producing the first estimates of cause-specific child mortality at the sub-national level by combining it with information from large scale sample surveys such as National Family Health Survey and District Level Household Survey that for the last decades has been collecting data on sub-national coverage of health interventions and prevalence of key health practices. The innovative and unique combination of these three impressive surveys will help India in identifying priority areas for action by contextualizing the barriers to child survival according to prevailing socio-cultural practices; quantifying the impact of targeted interventions by estimating the annual number of lives saved and estimating the impact that local action could have on India's national neonatal and child survival rates."

Ab-C Risk will recruit an additional 1,000 Canadians belonging to higher risk demographic and ethnic groups. The Ab-C cohort was recruited in collaboration with the Angus Reid Institute, which will continue to lead in surveying participants periodically about COVID-related experiences, including infection, clinical signs and symptoms, exposures, PCR testing for the virus (including variants of concern), and vaccination. Ab-C relies on participants to self-collect finger prick blood samples on special paper, and send them to Unity Health for analysis for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Three rounds of surveys and blood samples have been completed. A fourth and fifth round, planned into 2022, will include the new Ab-C Risk cohort. 

The main Ab-C Risk research questions are: 
1. What are the levels of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-induced and natural immunity among VIPs compared with other groups?
2. How does persistence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among VIPs compare with other groups?
3. Can we identify age-specific predictors of maintained and declining SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among VIPs compared with others?

After each Phase, Ab-C publishes for a professional audience in high-impact journals, and for the public in a variety of forms, including Ab-C newsletters and interviews with the Canadian press. We plan to add video releases to be widely distributed to planners and others working with VIPs.

The Ab-C team, from six Canadian research institutions and the Angus Reid Institute, combines experience in large-scale population epidemiology, demography and biostatistics, laboratory science, clinical infectious disease, Indigenous health, health economics and priority setting, health equity, IT, communications, and knowledge translation."

In Spring 2021, our research team conducted a cross-Canada survey examining the experiences of children and parents with and without ADHD. Parents completed online questionnaires assessing COVID-19 stress, parent and child mental health outcomes and lifestyle factors, parental beliefs regarding parenting, the parent-child relationship, and parent beliefs and behaviours related to child learning. The proposed study aims to follow up with these families to understand their experiences in the next school year and determine how prior levels of pandemic-related stress predict later child and parent outcomes. This study uses a one-year longitudinal design to follow up with families from our existing data collection (Time 1) at two additional timepoints (Time 2 and Time 3) in the upcoming school year. This study has three main objectives: (1) To examine how children with and without ADHD and their parents are faring in the aftermath of the pandemic, and (2) To examine how prior COVID-19 stress predicts later parent and child outcomes for children with and without ADHD, and (3) To provide meaningful information about malleable targets for the management and treatment of ADHD in the wake of the pandemic. Five hundred and thirty-nine parents in the ADHD group and 131 parents in the non-ADHD group of our original study have agreed to be contacted for future research. A timely response to support families with and without ADHD is only possible with an understanding of the continued and long-term effects of COVID-19 on child mental health and important lifestyle factors, parent mental health, and child learning-related parental beliefs and behaviours. Knowledge from this study will lead to targeted evidence-based resources for children and families to support them in recovering from the pandemic."

"The mental health consequences of COVID-19 stress on children and parents: A multinational, longitudinal cohort study","['Johnson, Dylan']",['N/A'],"['Adverse Childhood Experiences', 'Covid-19', 'Longitudinal', 'Mental Health', 'Multinational Cohort', 'Population Health', 'Stress']",105000.0,439344,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant changes for families that include heightened risk of job loss and financial insecurity, changes to schedule, interpersonal disconnection, and related confusion, fear, and anger. These experiences pose a clear risk to the well-being of children, as they are still in development and sensitive to stressful experiences. Despite international calls for research on the mental health consequences of COVID-19 for vulnerable groups, few studies have been designed to determine the extent of mental health difficulties among children during this period. As such, the proposed study plans to carry out a series of investigations into the mental health ramifications of COVID-19 on both parents and children. To achieve these objectives, data will be collected from two sources that include: the international Child Resilience and Managing Pandemic Emotional Distress in Families (CRAMPED) longitudinal cohort study and the national COVID-19 Adjustment, Resilience, and Experience (CARE) cohort study. Data will be collected on COVID-19 related stress, family functioning, parental childhood experiences, and parent/child mental health. The proposed project will explore the relationship between COVID-19 stress and mental health, as well as how parental COVID-19 stress influences child mental health. In addition, the way in which early-life adversity and positive experiences influence respective risk and resiliency in the relationship between COVID-19 stress and parental mental health, will be explored. Given the substantial social disruptions that COVID-19 presents to children and families, the proposed research is paramount for better understanding the impact, as well as identifying public health targets to intervene and deter substantial individual and social burden."
Evaluation of Syndromic Surveillance Systems used during the H1N1 pandemic from a Public Health Perspective,"['Johnson, Ian L']","['Crowcroft, Natasha S', 'Davies, Richard F', 'Gemmill, Ian M', 'Rosella, Laura C', 'Willison, Donald J']","['Evaluation', 'H1n1', 'Pandemic', 'Public Health', 'Surveillance', 'Syndromic']",99991.0,198373,"During the H1N1 pandemic, public health agencies used multiple sources of information to monitor how many people were becoming sick with the infection.  This information was used to plan and evaluate public health prevention programs, such as deciding the priority groups to be immunized. Many of these sources of information were new and had not been used in an outbreak like this before.  For example, in Ontario, daily counts of the number of persons calling public health hotlines like Telehealth with respiratory symptoms were used to assess how the virus was spreading in the population.   Other sources of information measured the number of people presenting to physicians or emergency departments with a specific set of symptoms, such as fever and cough, and this information was recorded and used to track the virus before a definitive diagnosis of H1N1 was made by the laboratory.  The goal of using these data sources was to have earlier detection of the spread of disease by eliminating the time spent waiting for laboratory diagnosis.  A limitation of these data sources, however, is that many diseases may cause similar symptoms. Given the expense in both staff time and money, this research project proposes to evaluate these new systems using standard methods developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States. Each of the new sources of information will be compared to standard data sources (laboratory and public health reporting systems) in terms of the accuracy of information, timeliness of the results, and usefulness of the data in making local decisions.   The overall goal of this research proposal is understand the value of these new systems during the pandemic to assist in planning future investments for the detection and tracking of future pandemics and other public health disease outbreaks."

Its use has been growing in popularity because of the potential to detect outbreaks and other unusual events earlier than traditional surveillance (e.g. laboratory confirmed diagnosis) and due to the increasing availability of such data electronically.  Our 2010 survey of Ontario local public health agencies (OLPHAs) showed that 50% used syndromic surveillance systems, with the 2009 influenza pandemic accelerating its growth. In Alberta, the Alberta Real Time Syndromic Surveillance Net (ARTSSN) in use since 2003, has also recently expanded throughout the province. Despite such growth, we found that syndromic data had limited influence on local decision-making during the pandemic in Ontario.  This finding raises questions of the value of syndromic surveillance systems if the data are not linked to a public health response.  The absence of protocols guiding users on how to respond to unusual events detected in syndromic data has been identified as a barrier to using these data.  As a result, we plan to test whether the development and application of tools designed to detect unusual events and guide response will improve the usefulness of syndromic surveillance systems.   The study has two phases.  First, thresholds for detecting unusual events will be developed using existing ED and school absenteeism data. Concurrently, protocols for interpreting and responding to these alerts will be created.  Second, OLPHAs and Alberta health zones with access to syndromic surveillance will be randomly assigned to use these new protocols or to use standard-practice approaches.  The effectiveness of these new protocols will be assessed by comparing the number of generated alerts and public health responses, and by user perceptions of their value."

The interventions will be developed in a participatory and culturally sensitive way to tackle a highly important determinant of health that until now has been taboo and gone unaddressed, namely childhood sexual violence. This study will be the first to create complementary individual and community-based primary prevention and tertiary intervention programs aimed at reducing sexual violence among Inuit youth and treating its effects in all four land claims regions of the Canadian North. The interventions, developed using a participatory approach that will build research and clinical capacity in the four regions, will become Inuit-informed and owned tools for preventing and managing sexual violence among Inuit youth. By addressing sexual violence, this study will impact critical health issues for Inuit peoples including mental health, psychosocial functioning, and a range of health-related concerns including those associated with reproduction, early development, childhood, adolescence, obesity, and substance abuse. This study will develop knowledge on effective sexual violence interventions targeted to the Inuit people and will enhance the evidentiary base concerning effective interventions that have the potential to impact health at the population level."
Moving Towards Equitable and Accessible Contraception Care: Describing the Unmet Contraception Needs of Vancouver Island Youth aged 15-29 through Community-Based Research,"['Johnston, Bronte K']",['N/A'],"['Community Health Programming', 'Community-Based Research', 'Contraception', 'Healthcare Acess', 'Population Health Interventions', 'Reproductive Health Justice', 'Sexual Healthcare', 'Socio-Structural Factors', 'Young Women', 'Youth']",105000.0,497202,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has prioritized universal contraception by 2030; however, many, particularly youth and those in rural areas, struggle to access the contraception they need. In Canada, youth are the dominant contributors to the rate of unplanned pregnancies and many experience contraception inaccessibility, but their unmet needs are unknown. This project will qualitatively assess the unmet contraception needs of rural Vancouver Island youth and the intersecting social and structural factors that shape their sexual health access through community research. The study population will be 50 youth and 20-25 local sexual healthcare providers across rural and urban-rural Vancouver Island communities. This work will be rooted in intersectionality and reproductive justice from macrostructural (policy), community, and micro-services (clinics) perspectives to see the intersections that impact youths' unmet contraception needs. I will develop asset maps to understand the intersection of asset accessibility and youths' identities based on 50 youth interview data from youth co-researchers that I will thematically analyze. I will conduct interviews with 20-25 local sexual health practitioners; the transcripts will be analyzed through coding (grounded theory approach) to iteratively evaluate youths' unmet contraception needs and connections to their intersecting identities. All results will be triangulated for how they converge, complement, and expand each other to understand the individual and collective factors that impact youths' unmet contraception needs. Data will be iteratively shared with the communities to inform recommendations. It is hypothesized that minimal contraception resources will be available in remote areas and that youth with marginalized intersecting identities will have multiple unmet contraception needs. This research will help to improve contraception equity within Canada and to meet the WHO's 2023 target for universal contraception."

People with ADHD have problems such as not being able to concentrate or pay attention, being impulsive, and being overactive or feeling restless. We used to believe that only children had ADHD. Now we know that ADHD occurs at all ages. Given their problems with inattention and impulsiveness, the behaviour of people with ADHD can lead to problems in getting along with their families. Although we know quite a lot about how children with ADHD get along with their families, very few studies have looked at parents with ADHD and how they interact with their children. This study is one of the first to focus on parents with ADHD. We will compare families where both a parent and a child have ADHD to families where just the child has ADHD or families where no one has ADHD. We will ask parents about their parenting strategies and relationship with their children, and we`ll observe how the parents and children get along in a variety of situations. There are two important aspects of this study. First, we will include both mothers and fathers. Second, we will measure, not only the problems that parents with ADHD have, but also the positive aspects of their parenting. For example, do parents with ADHD have more energy or empathy for their children? This study will provide critical answers to questions about the functioning of families of parents and/or child with ADHD. Once we understand how adults with ADHD meet the challenges of parenting, we will be able to design treatments that build on their strengths and support them in raising their children."
From Patient to Policy: Using data to drive TB elimination in Canada's foreign born population,"['Johnston, James C', 'Brode, Sarah K', 'Greenaway, Christina A', 'Janjua, Naveed Z', 'Schwartzman, Kevin']","['Ahmad Khan, Faiz', 'Balshaw, Robert F', 'Campitelli, Michael A', 'Cook, Victoria J', 'Jamieson, Frances B', 'Kwong, Jeffrey C', 'Lalji, Fawziah', 'Macdonald, Liane', 'Marras, Theodore K', 'Mayhew, Maureen', 'Menzies, Richard', 'Pottie, Kevin', 'Rea, Elizabeth H', 'Sander, Beate H']","['Migrant Health', 'Population Health', 'Tuberculosis']",1208699.0,357237,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the world's leading infectious disease killer. This disease affects over 10 million people each year and causes 1.8 million deaths. The World Health Organization has made TB elimination a priority and is calling for new programs that prevent and treat TB. Unfortunately, progress towards TB elimination in Canada has stalled in recent years and our national TB elimination efforts are far from complete. This is in part due to persistently high rates of TB in Canada's growing foreign-born population. To accelerate TB elimination efforts in Canada, new strategies for TB prevention in migrant populations are needed. 

The most promising approach to TB prevention is to detect latent (asymptomatic) TB and treat it before the disease develops and spreads. This approach is potentially effective but is extremely resource intensive, so broad latent TB screening and treatment of the 6.8 million foreign-born residents of Canada is impractical. Instead, we need to create a screening strategy that balances the public health benefits of TB prevention with the system resources required for such a program. 

Using health databases from BC, Ontario, and Quebec--the three largest migrant-receiving provinces, we aim to develop evidence that will help guide TB screening and preventative therapy in the foreign-born population of Canada. First, we plan to develop a TB risk calculator that quantifies an individual's risk of active TB. We then plan to examine the impact of screening in different populations, including understanding the most cost-effective screening approaches. 

This research directly addresses the three key themes highlighted by the federal government's plan to enhance Canadian TB elimination. Our findings will generate valuable to inform public health policies and screening programs aimed at tackling TB."

For example, women must leave their families and communities to give birth. They receive limited perinatal care, support, and access to resources/information in their first language. These circumstances are inherently stressful, and create isolating contexts for women at a time when they are most vulnerable. The role of gender within Inuit perinatal wellbeing is often overlooked. Wellness studies have also typically involved an evaluative framework developed by non-Indigenous researchers and has not focused on gender. Inuit in Arviat, Nunavut, perceive perinatal wellbeing as a priority, yet issues continue to go unaddressed in policy and program delivery. Co-designed with Arviarmiut and aimed at improving perinatal wellness, the Ilagiingniq project involves a pilot program of support and study that aim to strengthen the relationship between gender, wellness, and cultural traditions/activities. Rooted within Inuit values and knowledge, this three-year project aims to create knowledge concerning gender and perinatal wellness, and facilitate knowledge sharing activities that amplify Inuit voices, and build upon existing capacity within the community. Ilagiingniq will be developed within/underpinned by Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (IQ) (Inuit traditional knowledge) and involve the hiring and training of community-based perinatal support workers. Research will focus on Inuit-specific wellness indicators and follow the Aajiiqatigiingniq research methodology developed by the Aqqiumavvik Wellness Society, which outlines four stages to research according to Inuit cultural systems: 1) relationship-building, 2) reach shared understanding, 3) share lived experiences, and 4) relational consensus-building. Insights from the study will be shared to benefit the community and bolster existing initiatives."
Where should we eat? Lunch source and dietary measures among youth during the school week,"['Jones, Amanda C']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,324567,"Where we get our food from influences what type of food we eat. Eating food outside the home leads to a diet that is less healthy. In our research, we looked at where high school students got their lunch during the school week. We investigated whether the source of their lunch was linked to how much fruits and vegetables they ate and sugary beverages they drank.

We surveyed almost 24,000 students from Ontario. Our survey looked at behaviours that affect health and was part of a study called COMPASS. Our analysis looked at what factors influenced food source and eating behaviours.

Students most frequently got their lunch from home (an average of 2.9 days per school week), followed by a lunch purchased in the school cafeteria (1.1 days) and lunch purchased from a fast-food place or restaurant (0.9 days). Eating a lunch from home was linked with students having less spending money, being ""White"" ethnicity and being female. A cafeteria lunch was linked with more spending money, lower school grade and female gender. A fast food lunch was linked with male gender, more spending money and higher physical activity. Students who ate a home lunch more often, ate more fruits and vegetables. Eating a fast food lunch was linked with drinking sugary beverages more frequently. Cafeteria lunches were linked with increases in both sugary drinks and fruits and vegetables.

Ontario high school students regularly eat lunch outside of home or school. Where students get their lunch during the school week may have an important influence on what youth eat. Our study supports the need for policies that improve healthy eating in school environments."
Beyond the interview transcript: Developing visual methods in health policy research,"['Jones, Catherine M']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1350.0,352457,"Qualitative research on health policy often uses key informant interviews as a method for data collection. In a study on national policy on global health in Switzerland and Norway, we introduced visual techniques of drawing on sketch-pads in 25 face-to-face interviews with senior level administrators and policy-makers in health, development and foreign policy sectors. When drawings are produced during interviews, abstract policy concepts are externalised onto paper in the form of images to which informants can react, reflecting on their experiences and commenting, comparing, or contradicting that visual representation. We informed participants about plans to use graphic methods in the recruitment process. We placed a sketchpad and pencils on the table at the start of each interview and explained that they could be used for mapping out activities and to visualise the processes and connections between them. Policy-makers interact with these techniques in a variety of ways. For discussion, diagraming works within a semi-structured interview to document and translate the policy process into an image to which the researcher or the informant can refer to later for more detail or for establishing relationships between parts of the sketch. For reflection, drawing engages informants in thinking about their participation in the policy process via a visual representation of their account. We analysed the visual data produced to visualise gaps in the data for subsequent rounds of interviews, to identify critical events, actors and contexts, and to construct a model of each country's policy arena. We aim to demonstrate how graphic methods in research on intersectoral policy processes go beyond the verbatim transcript by producing visual data with study participants to model their understandings of policy work with other sectors. While this research was conducted in Europe, we suggest visual methods are relevant for health policy research with decision-makers elsewhere."

PAN proposes to explore the current housing status & issues for PHAs, modelled after the OHTN ""Positive Spaces, Healthy Places"" research study, to achieve the following objectives:

1.  To understand:
a. factors that affect housing status of PHAs: quality of housing, level of housing & related supports which impact the mental and physical health of PHAs;
b. how these factors impact access to & utilization of health and social services.
2. To higlight similarities & differences between particular groups of PHAs including Aboriginals, ethnic and sexual minorities, women, youth, and ex-prisoners with regard to their experiences of housing & homelessness;
3. To study the differences that exist between the BC and Ontario housing systems and needs of their PHAs.

Our overarching hypothesis is that quality housing and security is an important factor contributing to the mental and physical health of PHAs, to their access to health & social services, and quite possibly to the prevention of HIV.  We also hypothesize that good quality and security of housing decreases unnecessary health and social service utilization and results in cost savings.  Finally, we hypothesize that there are risk factors, including demographic characteristics and health status, which play a role in the housing & homelessness of PHAs.  We will study and determine the best CBR & GIPA principles for collecting relevant data to create a province-wide study designed in which PHAs will be followed for up to 3 years, including reviewing methodologies used in the OHTN's 'Positive Spaces, Healthy Places' study.  Changes in housing status will be observed, along with factors that play a role in these changes and& outcomes resulting from these changes."

PLPH will document the successes and challenges of various housing-related programs, services and policies from three case study communities - Vancouver, Kamloops and Prince George - each of which face significantly different housing needs and pressures, and have distinct housing and HIV service structures. To achieve this, we will interview 125 people living with HIV at two time points and a total of 60 service providers, service users, and decision makers from the three communities. These qualitative findings will complement the descriptive, quantitative data on the housing circumstances and needs of over 300 PHAs in BC available through the Food Security and HIV Study as well as the policy analysis data from Phase I of PLPH. The result will be actionable evidence about PHA's housing experiences and program, service and policy best practices with HIV-related housing service providers and community based organizations. This community-based research project is the culmination of a four-year community-driven process to respond to an identified need for HIV housing. PLPH has already been an important catalytic agent for CBR in BC through the collaborative process of PHASE I, and the PHASE II will provide the tools for aligning housing policy in BC with coordinated responses to HIV/AIDS in order to achieve outcomes that will enhance the health and wellbeing of PHAs throughout the province."

Linked to the international HIV Stigma Index initiative, it will be the first ever Canadian community-based research study to document experiences of stigma and discrimination from the perspective of people living with HIV. This action-oriented project will translate community experiences into language decision-makers can effectively use; build a shared agenda to influence programs, services and policies; and positively impact individuals involved. The HIV Stigma Index is both a process (of building partnerships & capacity) and an action-based research tool (building on a quantitative & qualitative questionnaire). Designed by and for people living with HIV, and led by people living with HIV, this project will inform better evidence-based responses to HIV and related issues at all levels, and will empower the community to take a leap forward in the struggle for freedom from HIV stigma and discrimination. In this Planning and Partnership Development Phase, we will support people living with HIV to be HIV Stigma Index study leaders and build capacity for people living with HIV to participate in research planning and partnership development; build an inclusive partnerships regionally and nationally, ensure the questionnaire includes additional sections based on regional themes and priority populations, develop sampling and recruitment plans for BC, identify initial local priorities and actions for addressing HIV-related stigma and discrimination, and submit our research ethics application."

All Indigenous peoples - including those who do not have 'Status' under Canada's Indian Act - have the right to be counted. Their perspectives and priorities must guide how data is collected, used, and reported. Yet, at present, First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples who do not have 'Status' or are not registered with Métis Nation BC are 'invisible' and 'uncounted' within population health and wellness reporting in British Columbia (BC).

Responsibility for reporting on health of BC residents lies with the Office of the Provincial Health Officer (OPHO). Through agreements with federal, provincial, and Indigenous governments, the OPHO's responsibilities include collaboratively reporting on health and wellness of diverse Indigenous peoples living in the province.

Currently, there is no process in place to report on health and wellness of ""uncounted"" Indigenous peoples. This work must be done in partnership with Indigenous collectives representing this population. Current gaps include:

•No strengths-based, self-determined terminology to refer to diverse Indigenous peoples who are uncounted in population health data
•Lack of formal relationships with Indigenous collectives representing uncounted Indigenous peoples;
•No way of identifying this population in existing BC population health data
•Absence of research frameworks that reflect uncounted Indigenous peoples' perspectives of health and wellness
•No implementation plan for province-wide population health reporting led by uncounted Indigenous peoples, on their terms

The goal of this project is to support the health and wellness of uncounted Indigenous peoples living in BC by addressing current gaps in population health reporting, through partnerships that uphold Indigenous self-determination, decision-making, and perspectives of health and wellness."

Peer support workers are persons with SMIs who help others with SMIs recover. In addition to fostering recovery, peer support workers may also foster generativity, or experiences of contributing towards the betterment and well-being of others. Examples of generativity are caregiving or engaging in political participation. In addition to adding meaning to one's life, generativity may also foster recovery. However, no study has explored generativity, or what may facilitate expressions of generativity, in persons with SMIs receiving peer support; nor has the role generativity plays in recovery from SMIs been explored. The objectives of this study are to investigate 1) experiences of generativity, 2) what might facilitate generativity, and 3) the role generativity plays in recovery in persons with SMIs receiving peer support. This project was developed, and will continue being developed, through collaborating with persons with SMIs. First, we will interview persons with SMIs receiving peer support to explore experiences of generativity, facilitators of generativity, and the role generativity plays in recovery. Findings from the interviews will be organized according to common and important themes. We will then distribute questionnaires to a larger number of persons with SMIs receiving peer support. Our choice of questionnaires will be based on what participants say during the interviews. We will then analyze findings from the questionnaires to determine what factors might lead to generativity, as well as to determine if generativity is related to recovery. Findings from this project may illuminate the ways persons with SMIs contribute to society and help peer support workers develop interventions aimed at increasing generativity in their clients."
A Multi-National Study to Understand the Burden and Risk Factors for Atrial Fibrillation,"['Joseph, Philip G']","['Connolly, Stuart J', 'Healey, Jeff S', 'Paré, Guillaume', 'Raina, Parminder S', 'Yusuf, Salim']","['Atrial Fibrillation', 'Epidemiology', 'Prevalence', 'Risk Factors']",65000.0,351861,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder. Across the world, the number of people with AF is increasing, with the highest burden in economically developed countries such as Canada. People with AF are at an increased risk of death, stroke, and heart failure. Once AF occurs, it can be both difficult and costly to manage, where most patients eventually need life-long blood-thinners, and the treatments to 'cure' AF are only partially effective. Therefore, a greater focus on preventing AF in the first place (e.g. primary prevention) is needed.

The major limitation to preventing AF is that its risk factors remain poorly understood, with only half of AF risk explained by common, known risk factors. It is well known that economic development has resulted in large changes in upstream health determinants, such as diet and physical activity, as well as changed to the environment, which may explain why AF is more common in developed countries. In this multi-national project of approximately 160 000 participants from 17 countries, we aim to examine how 'upstream' health related behaviours (e.g. physical activity, diet) and environmental factors (e.g. air pollution) are related to AF risk. Knowledge from this study will inform additional research into the causes of AF and policies aimed at its prevention."

Deworming is recommended by WHO as of one year of age. However, many countries do not include 12-23 month-olds in national deworming programs. We recently completed a randomized controlled trial of 12-month old children in Iquitos, Peru, demonstrating the impact of deworming on growth and development. Results will be presented at scientific meetings and to policy-makers. In addition, it is essential that results be communicated directly where they can be of practical benefit and uptake. 
Objective: The proposal is to disseminate trial results in two worm-endemic countries, Peru and México.
Activities: Peru does not have a national deworming program, but instead conducts periodic campaigns, primarily in schools. Ministry of Health guidelines for deworming exclude children under two years of age. The proposed audiences for dissemination include: 1) families who participated in the trial, 2) Regional Ministry of Health (MoH), 3) Universidad Nacional de la Amazonia Peruana, 4) Medical College, in Iquitos; 5) MoH and 6) other stakeholders, in Lima. 
México has one of the largest deworming programs in the world, which is integrated into 'National Health Weeks', targeting 2-14 year-old children. Evidence from our trial suggests that Mexico consider the value of including children as of one year of age. Proposed fora for dissemination include: 1) Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, 2) MoH, 3) International Congress of Parasitology, in Mexico City and; 4) Instituto Nacional de Salud Publica in Cuernavaca. 
Summary: The proposed dissemination activities will bring new evidence on deworming benefits in young children to key policy-makers, researchers, civil society and the community and contribute to the evidence base for the global policy on deworming in all 130 worm-endemic countries."
Burden of disease in pregnant women with malaria and helminth co-infection: addressing health inequalities contributing to poor maternal and child health outcomes.,"['Joseph, Serene']",['N/A'],"['Anemia', 'Birth Outcomes', 'Co-Infection', 'Developing Countries', 'Global Health', 'Health Inequality', 'Hookworm', 'Malaria', 'Maternal And Child Health', 'Poverty']",150000.0,184585,"One of the most pressing issues in global health research is the health inequality faced by women in developing countries. Pregnant women are at an increased risk of poor health outcomes due to the inherent increased stress of pregnancy and other risk factors common in resource-poor areas, such as malnutrition and parasitic and infectious diseases. Two parasitic infections which are important in pregnancy are malaria and hookworm. Individually each has a distinct negative effect on maternal anemia and health, which in turn impacts newborn and child health. Malaria and hookworm are commonly found in the same geographical locations around the world; however, there has been little attention or consensus on the impact of co-infection during pregnancy and the potential for adverse effects to the mother and child. The proposed study will examine the impact of malaria and hookworm co-infection in pregnant women in the Amazon Basin region of Peru, an area of high prevalence for both infections. Pregnant women, including adolescent girls, will be recruited into the study in early pregnancy, and will be followed up to one month post-delivery. Malaria and hookworm infection, anemia, diet and other important maternal and child characteristics will be measured and the development of maternal anemia and infant anemia and birth weight will be compared between groups of women according to infection status. Currently, improving maternal health is a priority area in global health research and a focus of the Millennium Development Goals. This project will help to elucidate the magnitude of the relationship between malaria and hookworm, and to focus efforts, such that the most cost-effective prevention and treatment for pregnant women are provided. Ultimately the results of this study will provide crucial evidence to inform integrated and concerted intervention efforts in pregnancy and contribute to the reduction of health inequalities in this vulnerable group of women."
Moving Towards Cultural Safety in Indigenous Contracting: Lessons from British Columbia,"['Josewski, Viviane']",['N/A'],"['Case Study', 'Community-Based Health Services', 'Critical Ethnography', 'Cultural Safety', 'Health Contracting', 'Health Policy & Services', 'Indigenous Epistemiologies', 'Indigenous People', 'Mental Health & Addictions', 'Self-Determination']",105000.0,229613,"In response to the mental health disparities experienced by Aboriginal peoples, and related inequities regarding the accessibility to appropriate mental health care, there has been a shift in health policy to promote culturally safe mental health care delivery models. Practices that are culturally-safe support the principles of Aboriginal self-determination, community capacity building and approaches to health and healing that result in positive health outcomes and reduced health disparities. Yet, recent research indicates that current funding arrangements via proposal-driven contractual agreements are problematic for Aboriginal organizations and in some cases undermine the development of culturally safe mental health and addictions services. The objective of this study is therefore to develop a better understanding of how current policies and funding models of different organizations have shaped the provision of Aboriginal mental health and addictions services in an urban context. A partnership-based approach to study selected Aboriginal agencies in British Columbia will be utilized. In addition, data will be collected through interviews and focus groups with recipients of care, providers, and local and national leaders in Aboriginal mental health. The results from this analysis will inform the development of culturally safe and effective funding arrangements for Aboriginal mental health and addictions care."

Outdated models of stress emphasizing that stress is bad persist in research, medicine, and culture, sometimes influencing parents to encourage adolescents to avoid stress indiscriminately. Yet, stress is not always a bad thing - it can help us grow. In their journey toward becoming fulfilled adults, adolescents would thus benefit from learning how to optimize their stress when engaging with valuable yet demanding opportunities. My innovative postdoctoral project is about understanding how adolescents regulate stress and empowering parents to provide healthy, supportive guidance during stressful moments. I will bridge together different stress and emotion regulation theories in novel ways to better inform how parents should talk about stress with their adolescents. This will result in a brief intervention that procures a more positive mindset about stress and challenges in parents. Using a combination of advanced methods and technology (e.g., measuring stress hormones and cardiac reactivity and using AI to analyze the effect of parents' choice of words), I will test whether this so-called ""stress optimization"" intervention has the potential to foster healthier stress responses in 500 dyads of parents and adolescents, and promote challenge seeking in adolescents. Once I have tested the role of parents' mindsets in how adolescents respond to laboratory social stressors, I will conduct a second study to test if the benefits of this intervention are seen beyond the laboratory and last in time, when adolescents face real-life social stressors."
Improving vulnerable preschoolers' mental health: A superiority trial assessing the How-to Parenting Program,"['Joussemet, Mireille', 'Mageau, Geneviève A']","['Brendgen, Rosemarie M', 'Koestner, Richard', 'Laberge, Maude', 'Larose, Marie-Pier', 'Ouellet-Morin, Isabelle', 'Schnitzer, Mireille E', 'Tarabulsy, George', 'Vitaro, Frank']","['Child Mental Health', 'Early Childhood', 'Parenting', 'Targeted Primary Prevention']",665549.0,452236,"Psychological problems are common: one out of five young children live with some mental health problems. These problems can persist and negatively affect life up to adulthood. Efforts should thus be made to stave off more serious problems before they occur. There are biological causes for child mental health problems but fortunately, environmental factors may help prevent problems and foster well-being. Among these malleable factors, parenting quality is the most determinant. 
We are interested in the How-to Parenting Program, a 7-session parenting workshop that teaches the three key ingredients of parenting quality linked to child mental health and well-being (being warm, structuring, and autonomy-supportive). In our prior studies, we found that this program helped school-aged children (reduced mental health problems such as opposition and aggression) in addition to improving parenting quality. 
Our research team now intends to test whether the How-to Program can also be helpful for younger and more vulnerable children. We will assess its impact again, but this time with parents of 3- and 4-year-olds from disadvantaged neighborhoods and by comparing it to another workshop for parents, called Nobody's Perfect (NP). NP is the ideal comparison workshop because it is similar to How-to in format and cost, but different in content (NP does not teach specific parenting skills) and it is already offered in many communities across the country. Parents will assess child mental health four times (before and after programs delivery, 6 and 12 months later) and independent observers will assess child and parent behaviors. We expect child mental health and parenting quality to improve to a greater extent among families assigned to the How-to Program (vs. NP).
If expected benefits of the How-to Program are observed, our research team will take the necessary steps to deliver and evaluate it more widely, as transferring helpful parenting skills can foster early child mental health."

Social network analysis: Evaluation of peer-led intervention at North America's only supervised injection facility,"['Jozaghi, Ehsan']",['N/A'],"['Quantitative Method', 'Social Networks', 'Supervised Injection Facility', 'Theory Of Planned Behaviour']",150000.0,298740,"The Downtown Eastside (DTES) of Vancouver, Canada, once held the title as the most impoverished and drug infested neighborhood in Canada. However, there are indications that the neighborhood has been transformed as a result of long standing harm reduction programs such as Insite (Norh America's only supervised injection facility). What makes Insite unique is its peer education intervention program that has been operating for more ten years that aims at preventing HIV, hepatitis C (HCV) and illicit drug overdose.   This research using egocentric network of peers-that examines peer's immediate neighbors and associated interconnections-hypothesizes that peers education/work at Insite and local needle exchanges in Vancouver are able to alter attitude, norms and perceived behavioural control of injection drug users (IDUs) as it pertains to risky injection behavior such as needle sharing, needle reusing and public injection. It is further hypothesised that the peer led intervention social network dimension through InSite and the local needle exchange programs in the DTES not only alter the individual choices of IDUs, but also the culture of those who live in the neighbourhood. Finally, by relying on the theory of planned behaviour , this study will test the hypothesis that network function, particularly the social support of peers in the DTES, would encourage IDUs to be more inclined to engage in protective behaviour, leave fewer discarded syringes and inject less frequently in public."
Cultural Adaptation of a Shared Decision Making Tool With Aboriginal Women:  A Qualitative Study,"['Jull, Janet E']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal', 'Cultural Adaptation', 'Health', 'Health Equity', 'Health Literacy', 'Qualitative', 'Shared Decision Making']",1000.0,331807,"When compared with general populations in Canada, Aboriginal women are more likely to experience health inequity.

Inuit have a culture that guides them in their everyday life with close ties to family, community and the land, and with strong self-direction. Shared decision making engages people with their healthcare providers to make health decisions, and is important for person-centred care. An Inuit shared decision making toolkit, ""Not deciding alone"", has been developed by and with urban-based Inuit peer support workers and consists of training and tools to enhance Inuit participation in health decisions with healthcare providers. The aim of our study is to field test the Inuit shared decision making toolkit. This project has been designed and will be conducted by a Steering committee of healthcare providers, researchers, decision makers, and Inuit community members. First, Inuit who travel to receive healthcare outside of Nunavut will be interviewed about their experiences and how these experiences affect their opportunities to participate in making healthcare decisions. This information will be used to guide a field test of the Inuit shared decision making toolkit in Nunavut. All Baffin region community health workers will be invited to attend a meeting in one community, and trained to use the Inuit shared decision making toolkit. For 6 months after the meeting community health workers will have distance support to use the Inuit shared decision making toolkit in their communities with Inuit who will travel for healthcare. Then, community health workers will be invited for another meeting about how the Inuit shared decision making toolkit worked. Inuit who are from the Baffin region and who travel to Ottawa for healthcare will be asked about their experience with shared decision making and whether it helps them to participate with healthcare providers. The results will build information on how to make shared decision making available to everyone in Nunavut"

Western-trained health care providers typically lack understandings of diverse Aboriginal cultures, which has negatively affected participation of Aboriginal people in health care settings. Research that addressed care disparities and inequitable access and uptake of health services identified by and with a population of Aboriginal women (First Nations, Inuit and Métis women at Minwaashin Lodge) led to the development of a strategy ('peer-support shared decision making strategy') that participants in usability testing described as enhancing their participation in care decisions. A program of research evaluating the use of the peer-support shared decision making strategy is a logical next step: however, this can only be done from within a research partnership that is built upon foundations of trust and in ways that community partners define as useful and relevant to them and their members. In preparation for research, a meeting between researchers and members representative of Aboriginal populations with chronic disease is proposed. The meeting will build foundational knowledge pertaining to 1) understanding the needs of particular populations who experience chronic disease in relation to peer-support and health decision making (e.g. diabetes, cancer, HIV/AIDS, arthritis); 2) identifying relevant stakeholders across sectors which may lead to inter-sectoral and multidisciplinary collaborations, 3) initiating the negotiation of an ethical framework for research and establish a research collaboration founded on common ground; and, 4) planning next steps for building towards a longer-term, sustainable and ethical program of research with Aboriginal partners."

Trends in physical inactivity inequalities and equity in physical activity promotion,"['Juneau, Carl-Étienne']",['N/A'],"['Equity In Physical Activity Promotion', 'Evaluation Of Equity In Physical Activity Promotion', 'Health Promotion', 'Obesity', 'Physical Activity', 'Physical Activity Promotion', 'Physical Activity Promotion Evaluation', 'Population Health', 'Social Inequalities In Health', 'Social Inequities In Health']",105000.0,184526,"Background: Physical inactivity worsens health. In 2001, in Canada, its economic burden was $5.3 billion (2.6% of total health care costs). Over half of Canadians are inactive. Poor or less educated Canadians are less active than rich or more educated Canadians. Health promotion interventions that target the whole population can widen this gap. Governmental institutions in Canada, Sweden, and the United Kingdom recommend that health promotion interventions strive to reduce this gap while improving overall population health. Nonetheless, Quebec's 7-ministries plan against the obesity epidemic (Investir pour l'avenir) includes no gap-reduction objectives.
Hypotheses: (1) The physical inactivity gap widened in Canada and Quebec over the last decade. (2) Physical activity promotion interventions that overlook the gap contribute to its increase.
Objectives: (1) Find out if the physical inactivity gap narrowed, maintained, or widened in Canada and Quebec between 1994 and 2005. (2) Examine if Investir pour l'avenir narrows, maintains, or widens the physical inactivity gap.
Methodology: Analysis of large Canadian surveys (conducted between 1994 and 2005) that include questions on income, education, and physical activity habits of the population will answer the first objective. Evaluation of Investir's participant profile (does Investir reach more rich and very educated participants?) and of its effectiveness (is Investir more effective for rich and very educated participants?) will answer the second objective.
Significance: Result that show that the physical inactivity gap is widening and that physical activity promotion interventions that overlook it contribute to its increase could persuade physical activity promoters to help poor and less educated Canadians particularly. That would improve the Canadian health system by making it more just."

Our findings reveal that binary sex explains only a fraction of individual differences in stress physiology and mental health in comparison to sex hormones and gender-based factors.

In July 2020, we launched a survey that has received responses from over 3500 people pre-vaccination. We now seek funding to conduct follow-ups post-vaccination and one year after. Our research aims to identify psychological and social characteristics that are associated with risk and resilience in mental health changes of LGBTQI2S+ Canadians. Our 3-year research project will be done in three parts by means of an online survey, interviews, and the collection of biological samples to look at stress and sex hormones over time. We expect to better understand how LGBTQI2S+ are coping during the COVID-19 crisis and how this relates to their mental health. We also expect to identify risk factors contribute to poorer mental health such as stigma, poverty, and social isolation. By contrast, we also expect to identify unique ways that LGBTQI2S+ people who have had past experiences of stigma and adversity are able to cope well during the COVID-19 crisis. This form of resilience among some LGBTQI2S+ people is expected to be related to more favorable mental health outcomes. Studying this form of 'crisis competence' with our survey, interviews, and biological sampling will allow us to understand how stigmatized groups can sometimes develop adaptive ways of coping with distinct crises (e.g., HIV/AIDS pandemic, COVID-19 pandemic). By working in partnership with LGBTQI2S+ organizations, we are actively engaged to help identify the health and wellness needs during the COVID-19 crisis and thereafter with future studies and follow-ups. Collectively, this will help us improve the social, policy, and public health initiatives that serve LGBTQI2S+ communities in Canada and  prepare for future crises."

In recognition of young women's disproportionate risk of HIV, South Africa has initiated  a national campaign entitled ""She Conquers"", which has called for researchers and program implementers to listen to the needs, voices, and priorities of young women. Due to prevailing age, gender, racial and power inequities, young people are too often excluded from the decision-making processes that affect their lives. In response to a growing demand for youth- and client-centered approaches, we have proposed a knowledge translation and exchange (KTE) plan to help address poor engagement of HIV-affected youth in research, including KTE stages. The objectives of this grant are (1) To support a community-collaborative research team to plan and develop a KTE strategy to disseminate research findings to HIV-affected youth, policy makers, care providers, and other change agents in an accessible, inclusive and youth-centred format; (2) To build youth capacity in KTE focused on HIV and sexual and reproductive health; and (3) To support youth to plan, develop, and present KTE strategies that attend to pervasive gender and social inequities in access to information, access to care, and HIV risk and consequence. This proposal is a Canadian-South African collaboration of researchers, youth leaders, and community advocates with expertise and experience in HIV prevention research. As we advance towards the deadline to ""end AIDS by 2030"", we have a responsibility to better engage with and prioritize needs of communities who are the main participants and targets of HIV prevention efforts. This project is in line with, and can be used to inform, the Canadian government's feminist international assistance policy that recognizes that empowering women and girls is key to promoting gender equity and improving health and well-being around the world."
Getting to Zero: Catalyzing Community-based Research capacity in sexual and reproductive health among men living with HIV in rural Uganda,"['Kaida, Angela K', 'Muchenje, Marvelous']","['Bwana, Mwebesa B']","['Community-Based Research', 'Global Health', 'Hiv', 'Men Living With Hiv', 'Sexual And Reproductive Health']",39997.0,415452,"Millions of men and women living with HIV around the world want to have children and an estimated half have HIV-uninfected sexual partners. For the majority, achieving pregnancy involves condomless sex, presenting risks of HIV transmission to uninfected partners and infants. A range of available safer conception strategies can support individuals and couples to meet reproductive goals with minimal HIV risk. These strategies include sustained use of antiretroviral therapy with viral suppression by the partner living with HIV and/or pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) by the HIV-uninfected partner, which can eliminate HIV transmission risk during condomless sex.

While increasing attention has focused on improving access to safer conception care for women, much less is known about the needs of men. In 2018, we launched a pilot safer conception clinical program in a rural district of Uganda and recruited men living with HIV who reported wanting to have a child in the next year with an HIV-serodifferent pregnancy partner. Our preliminary findings revealed a strong demand, need, and retention in safer conception care.

After sharing preliminary findings, community and government leaders in Uganda emphasized three critical next steps: (1) support and enhance engagement of people living with HIV in the research, consistent with the GIPA and MIPA principles; (2) assess 18-month outcomes of men who enrolled in the safer conception program; and (3) pursue future applications in the area of HIV and STBBI research, grounded in community-based research principles. Thus, the overall goal of this proposal is to foster a collaboration between Canadian and Ugandan research and community stakeholders to catalyze community-based research capacity in male-inclusive safer conception research in rural Uganda. With a commitment to reciprocal learning, we will leverage Canadian expertise and experience in community-based research to inform safer conception research and clinical care in Uganda."

The role of comfort in mediating posture: Towards an application for virtual ergonomics,"['Kajaks, Tara']",['N/A'],"['Biomechanics', 'Comfort', 'Ergonomics', 'Human Behaviour', 'Ics Travel Awards', 'Musculoskeletal Disorders Prevention', 'Reaching']",1000.0,294414,"ICS Travel Award
Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are the leading cause of lost-time claims in Ontario, and are a significant burden to society costing employers an estimated $1 billion between 2003 and 2007(1). Ergonomists work to identify workplace risks for MSDs so as to improve worker health and safety. Fast and proactive estimates of MSD risks can be achieved using avatars in virtual reality workstation simulations. When performing these simulations, an assumption is often made that all workers move in an optimal way using the safest posture possible. Despite this over-generalization, this technology has led to significant health-related benefits to workers(2). Research is now needed to account for the fact that there are often multiple ways to perform a given task. Behavioural scientists predict that movements are chosen based on perceived comfort rather than optimal injury-prevention criteria. The present study examined movement patterns during simple reaching tasks in order to better understand the role that comfort plays in how people choose to move, rather than how they ought to move. Twelve participants were asked to pick up a waist-height key-like disk and insert it into a shoulder-height target while their hand orientation was tracked using a motion capture system. Task comfort was manipulated by altering the position of the disk and the target location between trials. Posture differences were compared across 24 different conditions. The study findings help inform when, why, and how movement choices put people at a greater risk of MSDs. By understanding how people actually choose to move, and their movement variability, ergonomists can using advanced ergonomic technology.

Examining the longitudinal associations between neighbourhood socioeconomic position and the built environment on future health throughout the life course: Data from a large multigenerational cohort study,"['Kakinami, Lisa']","['Bacon, Simon L', 'Barnett, Tracie A', 'Serbin, Lisa', 'Stack, Dale M', 'Van Hulst, Andraea']","['Built Environment', 'Longitudinal', 'Mental Health', 'Neighbourhood Socioeconomic Position', 'Physical Health', 'Social Inequalities In Health']",313650.0,382035,"Half of all Canadian adults will experience a major chronic illness such as cardiovascular disease or cancer. While the risk of these illnesses has been higher in men compared to women in the past, the gap is narrowing. Those of lower socioeconomic position (SEP) are at greater risk. The risk starts early in life and continues across the lifespan. Differences in the built environment features (such as the distance to nearby parks), are believed to be the connection. However, as health is also passed down generations, it's unclear how much the environment also explains health. In order to separate out the environment from biology, both need to be measured at the same time across generations. With the recent advancements in technology, conducting a study that can assess both at the same time is finally possible. 
This proposal uses data from three generations of 4000 families (>10,000 people) with 35 years of data. This project will be able to test whether risk from the environment differs (1) between generations, (2) based on age, (3) between men and women. How these differences may also change over time will also be tested. Study findings will identify some of the root causes of health differences. Results may help show how healthcare providers and city planners can reduce health inequality"
The longitudinal association between parenting style and obesity risk throughout childhood and adolescence in a representative sample of youth. Data from a 16-year birth cohort of Quebec children,"['Kakinami, Lisa']","['Barnett, Tracie A', 'Henderson, Melanie', 'Paradis, Gilles', 'Serbin, Lisa', 'Stack, Dale M']","['Children And Adolescents', 'Longitudinal', 'Obesity', 'Parenting Style']",63550.0,363395,"Obesity in Canadian youth has doubled since 1980. Obese children are more likely to become obese adults, and obesity is associated with a number of chronic diseases. Thus reducing childhood obesity is a top public health priority. While genetics play a role, most of the obesity risk is from behaviours. Interventions to fight obesity are usually targeted at schools but have been met with limited success. Nearly ¼ of Canadian children are already overweight or obese when they enter preschool. Thus a better understanding of how the family environment influences children's obesity risk is needed. Previous research focused on specific parenting behaviours, such as whether parents control the number of hours a child is allowed to watch TV. Much less is known about how the general parenting styles (how much affection or discipline parents use with their children) may affect children's obesity risk. Preliminary evidence suggests that parenting style may be affected by the child's characteristics (such as the child's sex, age, birth order, etc). However, the results are mixed and mainly from a limited number of cross-sectional samples. Large, longitudinal studies investigating these associations are sparse, and no longitudinal Canadian data have been reported. This study aims to improve our understanding of the early childhood origins of obesity, and longitudinal obesity risk throughout this developmental period. This study will not only identify the associations between parenting style and children's obesity risk at specific ages, but also of changes in associations over time. Data for the proposed project are from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD). The QLSCD is a 16-year birth cohort representative of singleton births in Quebec in 1998 (n=2,120). Our results will address a significant gap in the literature and will provide important knowledge for early prevention."

We are working towards a gathering of researchers, medical practitioners and other stakeholders to share existing information about pathways to medical abortion and to develop a set of research questions and methodologies which will lead to a coherent global research agenda and produce major grant applications. This work is urgent with recent political events  severely restricting women's access to abortion worldwide, at the same time as drugs for pregnancy termination become more readily available for ""off-license"" use. This work is also timely given Canada's very recent approval of the one-pill abortion medication Mifegymiso, as well as the federal government's commitment to maternal health as the centrepiece of its international development brand. The two co-investigators and our collaborator have already been actively working on securing funding for a focused international meeting in London to develop a global research agenda on women's pathways to medical abortion. This CIHR planning grant will support research assistance to prepare a synthesis document for this meeting, as well as ensuring the co-investigators' travel costs for two face-to-face meetings in London and Edmonton. This funding will greatly enhance our success at getting the major funding necessary to move from setting a research agenda to implementing comparative health projects."
"Falls prevention, mobility, and physical activities in Older adults","['Kalu, Michael E']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],556.0,364491,"This is a proposed Ph.D. thesis. 
The assessment for mobility and fit to participate as well as the development of suitable physical activities (exercises) for older adults with severe dementia is lacking in the literature. With my experience as an exercise instructor in a Long Term Care facility, I find it frustrating that severely dementia older adults are often neglected when developing exercises for either improve mobility or prevent falls.  Therefore,   I am particularly interested in understanding which of the various mobility assessments/tools/test can predict and prevent falls in advanced demented older adults. 
I hope that the findings of my studies will help develop mobility assessment tools that can predict falls in the severely demented older adults as well as provide insight on the how to develop specific exercises that will be suitable for them."
Does socioeconomic status of older adults affect their level of mobility? A State-of-the-art review.,"['Kalu, Michael E']",['N/A'],"['Care Transition', 'Mobility', 'Socio-Economic Factors']",1000.0,400002,"Background & Aims: Research shows that people who went to school and worked in a job that paid well are healthier than those who did not. We decided to find out if older adults who went to school and worked in a job that paid well have better mobility than those who did not. We also give information that healthcare workers can use to decide how older adults move inside and outside of their homes and around their communities 

Methods: We looked at five different records of literature. We reviewed English language research papers that were online between the year 2000-2018.  Two of us looked at the studies and agreed to include any paper that talked about older adults' income, education level, and occupation (job) and how it affects how they move around either by walking, using transportation or any assistive device (e.g. wheelchair).  

Results: We included 36 studies from eleven countries. Thirty-four of the 36 studies are good quality studies. We found 68 statistical summaries of how better education and working in a well-paying job affected how older adults move around. Out of the 68 summaries, 55 (81%) stated better educated and wealthier older adults move around their home and communities better. We also found that assessing older adults walking over long distances ( e.g. 400m or 800m) considers many things that support mobility (e.g. endurance, power, speed).

Conclusion: Better educated older adults who worked in well-paying jobs move better than those did not. Healthcare worker that want to look at how an older adult walks about in their home or community, should ask the older adult to walk a longer distance (e.g. 400m or 800m) during testing."

Exposure to air pollution is associated with lower sleep duration and higher odds of snoring and suspected OSA in China,"['Kanagasabai, Thirumagal']",['N/A'],"['Air Pollution', 'Black Carbon', 'Fine Particulate Matter', 'Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Quantity', 'Snoring']",500.0,412260,"Air pollution is a mixture of chemicals that negatively impacts human health, but we know little about its influence on sleep health. Some of the chemicals found in air pollution crosses into the brain, changing the brain chemistry that affects sleep. Among air pollution components, fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and black carbon can irritate the lungs and increase sleep-related breathing problems. We studied the effect of PM2.5 and black carbon air pollution on sleep duration, snoring and sleep apnea in 741 adults in China. We measured personal exposure to air pollution over 2 consecutive days and collected detailed information on participants' socio-economic and demographics, medical history, and behaviours, including sleep duration, snoring and sleep apnea in 2015-2016. We then evaluated the link between air pollution and sleep controlling for common confounders, such as age, gender, waist circumference, tobacco smoke exposure, physical activity, socioeconomic status, comorbidity, outdoor temperature and province of residence. We also assessed the link in selected vulnerable subpopulations, such as older adults, men/women, current tobacco smoke exposure, and the presence of co-morbid diseases. We found that 62% of our participants slept 7-9 hours per day, 60% reported snoring, and 13% had sleep apnea. For an average participant in our study, exposure to air pollution lowered sleep duration by 10 minutes, increased snoring by 20-30%, and increased sleep apnea by 350-450% compared to participants without any exposure to air pollution. Higher exposure to air pollution also linked with more significant sleep loss, 40 minutes at 300 µg/m³ for PM2.5. The link was stronger in older adults and in those living with co-morbid diseases. In summary, we found that exposure to air pollution lowered sleep duration, and increased the odds of snoring and sleep apnea. These links are dose-dependent and are higher in some groups."
The development and testing of a novel knowledge translation intervention for the prevention of pregnancy-related type 2 diabetes risk factors in Indigenous and South Asian women living in Canada,"['Kandasamy, Sujane']",['N/A'],"['Cardiovascular Disease Prevention', 'Health Behaviours', 'Health Knowledge', 'Immigrant Health', 'Indigenous Health', 'Mixed Methods', 'Type 2 Diabetes']",150000.0,376106,"Introduction: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for more than one-third of total global deaths. Although there has been a decline in CVD over the last three decades, the rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are expected to rise in high-risk ethnic communities.  Also, recent evidence suggests that the development of CVD risk factors is influenced by pregnancy-related factors. To better understand these factors, the Aboriginal Birth Cohort (ABC) and South Asian Birth Cohort (START) are recruiting mother-baby pairs from the Six Nations reserve and Peel region, respectively.  In parallel to high quality research, it is vital to create accessible avenues for meaningful knowledge translation.  Because pregnancy is a time period where women feel especially motivated to make positive lifestyle changes, it makes for an optimal time for knowledge translation. 
Objectives: In my PhD program, I seek to develop and test novel knowledge translation tools to improve the knowledge of pregnancy-related T2DM risk factors in high-risk communities (Indigenous and South Asian).  
Methods: A mixed-methods approach of quantitative and qualitative methodologies will be used to develop and test a knowledge translation intervention. Descriptive statistics will be used to compile existing data from two birth cohort studies (START and ABC, both being conducted by my supervisor) on the causes and consequences of these risk factors.  A qualitative approach will be used to thematically explore knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and behaviour change.  Participants for the qualitative study will be purposely sampled and recruited via the cohort studies' regular clinic visits.  Integrated KT methodology will be used to distill the research data to develop products alongside key stakeholders.
Conclusion: Now more than ever, it is imperative to integrate knowledge translation approaches to warrant the application of research results to practice and support the improvement of primary care."
The development and testing of a novel knowledge translation intervention for the prevention of gestational diabetes in Indigenous and South Asian women living in Canada,"['Kandasamy, Sujane']",['N/A'],"['Birth Cohort', 'Cardiovascular Disease Prevention', 'Gestational Diabetes', 'Indigenous Health', 'Mixed-Methods', 'Qualitative Research', 'Type 2 Diabetes']",105000.0,387251,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for more than one-third of total global mortality. While considerable declines in CVD have occurred over the last three decades, the rising prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is predicted to intensify the CVD epidemic in low and middle income countries, and in high-risk ethnic communities in high income countries. Canada is one of the most ethnically diverse countries in the world having more than 1.57 million South Asians and 1.4 million Indigenous people. Overweight and obesity is quickly escalating among children and adolescents in high income countries and the rate of childhood T2DM among South Asians and Indigenous peoples in Canada is also increasing.  This is further exacerbated by gestational diabetes, which places people at higher risk for T2DM.  The lack of clarity in the information presented to the public in this field affects health-related behaviours related to the primary prevention of CVD.  Knowledge translation research addresses the many existing gaps between what is known and what is actually done in primary care.  Evidence suggests the importance of developing high-quality knowledge translation tools in areas such as diabetes prevention.  In my PhD program, I aim to use a mixed-methods approach to: 1) develop and test a novel KT strategy to improve knowledge of gestational diabetes risk factors among Indigenous and South Asian peoples; 2) develop a series of digital-based integrated KT outputs for key stakeholders including local, provincial, and federal policymakers; 3) work with public health leaders and decision-makers to support policy building in the field of gestational diabetes prevention. It is imperative to integrate knowledge translation approaches to warrant the application of research results to practice and support the improvement of primary care, especially in the field of CVD prevention."
The Type 2 Diabetes Prevention Van: A Vehicle for mobilizing health promotion for newcomers living in Calgary and Hamilton,"['Kandasamy, Sujane']",['N/A'],"['Co-Designed Interventions', 'Community Engagement', 'Community-Centered Knowledge Translation', 'Newcomer Health', 'Type 2 Diabetes Prevention']",270000.0,491445,"Canada is welcoming an unprecedented number of immigrants over the next 5 years, who will arrive for economic, family and refugee claim. Changes in diet, activity, and social networks due to immigration impacts health outcomes. Health Canada acknowledges that immigration is a determinant of health, but there is no coordinated plan to ensure newcomers to Canada are set on a path towards optimal health. While it is well established that type 2 diabetes is inextricably linked with socioeconomic status and the social determinants of health, there has been less of a focus on the effects of immigration and migration as factors in the prevention and prevalence of type 2 diabetes in newcomers. The opportunity to integrate diabetes prevention is timely with the increase in immigration as is in the best interests of newcomer communities and the mainstream systems in which they interact. This proposal builds on existing research focused on providing culturally responsive and equity-based programs and services to ethnocultural populations. By addressing relevant social determinants of health, we will create mobile services (delivered using a ""health van"") to increase self-efficacy and human centered care. The mobile health van will include direct health services and screening in first language; specific target populations such as pregnant woman (e.g., gestational diabetes screening), temporary residents, and individuals with no status; leverage existing programs, relationships, and partners to develop, support, and train community advisors and navigators, and consider the possible outcomes informing educational curriculum at every level. This will be achieved by developing and sustaining key partnerships across service organizations invested in newcomer wellbeing, academic researchers with expertise in type 2 diabetes prevention, and healthcare professionals engaged in innovative behaviour change solutions."

For Canada's largest visible minority community, CVD related deaths are decreasing at a significantly slower pace than their European/British ancestry counterparts. South Asian ancestry Canadians experience heart disease at a significantly younger age and have a greater risk of premature death. Researchers have not been able to adequately address the reasons behind the higher prevalence for given the lack of conventional risk factors (i.e. absence of high fat diets, smoking and high rates of obesity). Based on the higher prevalence rate without the presence of conventional risk factors, and newly identified delays in emergency care when heart attack symptoms arise, evaluating how healthcare is accessed can inform if structural barriers are limiting healthcare access. This project aims to understand how one South Asian ancestry community considers, seeks, accesses, values and utilzes cardiovascular disease healthcare; and subsequently what factors shape their CVD healthcare access and uptake. A qualitative approach will be applied to conduct a Critical Ethnography whereby 5-8 cardiac healthcare providers will be interviewed regarding healthcare delivery factors; observational field notes will be collected at cardiac field sites to record how patients are responding to services and interactions with healthcare providers; and finally 30-40 interviews will be conducted with Punjabi ancestry Canadians living with CVD.  Post/colonial, feminist and critical race theory will anchor the qualitative analysis to deliver academic and community based knowledge sharing projects. Policy makers, clinicians, health educators and community members will benefit from a better understanding of how CVD care is sought, accessed and experienced."

Globally, last mile populations have included adolescents or young people living with disabilities, migrant populations, rural and remote populations, Indigenous youth, young people living in extreme poverty, and those living in minority communities with specific ethnic, religious and /or sexual beliefs and practices. They are likely to face related mental health problems. In many contexts, these populations and their health needs are missing from the main stream literature and/ or poorly identified. This meeting proposal focuses on last mile adolescents because they often face multiple vulnerabilities that make attainment of optimal health and rights difficult. 
The meeting aims to facilitate participatory priority setting by bringing together a multidisciplinary research team, representatives from non- government organizations (including youth organizations), health providers and decision makers to systematically identify the last mile adolescent populations in Uganda, establish and prioritize their SRHR intervention and research needs and gaps in order to develop an intervention and research agenda to address the identified priorities. Priority interventions will contribute to an agenda for addressing the SRHR needs for the last mile adolescents, thereby contributing to a more equitable achievement of the SDGs. While the research priorities will form  basis for a research agenda for the last mile adolescents' SRHR which will be useful to researchers and research funding agencies such as the Canadian Institutes for Health Research, Global Affairs Canada, as well as the Uganda National Health research organization.

The Effect of Outdoor Air Pollution on the Development and Prognosis of the Inflammatory Bowel Diseases,"['Kaplan, Gilaad G']",['N/A'],"['Air Pollution', 'Environmental Risk Factor', 'Inflammatory Bowel Diseases']",300000.0,170366,"Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are incurable diseases that affect a patient's gut. The causes of these diseases are not known. However, it most commonly occurs in industrial countries such as Canada that produce high levels of air pollution. Scientists have shown that air pollution can cause many problems such as worsening asthma, promoting heart attacks, and increasing the risk of cancer. Air pollution may cause sickness by promoting inflammation. The inflammation driven by air pollution is similar to the inflammation seen in patients who suffer from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Thus, it is possible that air pollution may cause inflammation that would result in Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Because of this possibility we plan to study whether air pollution increases the risk of being diagnosed with Crohn's disease and/or ulcerative colitis.
We plan to look at many people living in Alberta and follow them for several years to see who develops Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. We will then look to see how much air pollution occurs near their homes. We will also study individuals who are not diagnosed with Crohn's disease or ulcerative and see how much air pollution occurs near where they reside. Our hypothesis is that individuals who live in areas of higher air pollution will be more likely to be diagnosed with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis than individuals who live in regions of lower air pollution. 
Linking air pollution to the development of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis is important. If air pollution increases the risk of developing Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis, then lowering air pollution may prevent these diseases in some patients. Discovering such a relationship would potentially give us the tools to prevent these debilitating conditions - a far more effective strategy then treating an incurable disease once it has occurred."

Identifying spatial patterns and neighborhood-level risks of opioid-related overdoses to guide implementation of overdose prevention interventions,"['Karamouzian, Mohammad']",['N/A'],"['Fentanyl', 'Illicit Drug-Related Overdose', 'Neighborhood', 'Opioid Use Disorders', 'Socio-Structural Inequities', 'Spatial Analysis']",150000.0,440180,"North America is in the midst of a drug overdose epidemic, and the number of drug overdose deaths (ODs) has surpassed motor vehicle incidents and homicide deaths combined. Opioid-related fatal overdoses account for most drug ODs. Significant surges in opioid-related ODs in the past few years have been particularly attributed to the influx of North America's illicit drug supply with fentanyl and its analogues. While several studies have tried to assess individual-level risk factors of fatal and non-fatal overdoses, there is a need for neighborhood-level studies on opioid-related overdoses to identify neighborhoods at highest risk of opioid-related overdose and inform the implementation of targeted overdose prevention interventions. The objectives of this study are: 1) Summarizing the literature on neighborhood-level predictors of fatal and non-fatal opioid-related overdoses; 2) Characterizing the spatial trends and predictors of opioid-related fatal and non-fatal overdoses from 2014-2020 in Rhode Island, USA (i.e., a setting with one of the highest rates of drug ODs in North America); 3) Identifying neighborhoods vulnerable to future illicit fentanyl-involved ODs in Rhode Island, USA. Question 1 will be addressed through a systematic literature review and data synthesis of neighborhood-level risk factors of opioid-related overdose by searching several electronic scientific databases. Question 2 will be addressed using a large, linked, statewide dataset, and exploratory spatial data analysis. Question 3 will be addressed using spatial machine learning methods and timely surveillance data. This study will be conducted in collaboration with Rhode Island's Department of Health, the Governor's overdose task force, and representatives from treatment programs and community-based agencies. Ultimately, this study will inform the implementation of harm reduction and other public health interventions aimed at reducing opioid-related overdoses in North America."
Endometriosis Treatments and Pregnancy Outcomes: Associations and Experiences,"['Karim, Jalisa L']",['N/A'],"['Endometriosis', 'Family Planning', 'Mixed Methods', 'Perinatal Epidemiology', 'Population-Based Data', 'Pregnancy', 'Reproductive Health']",150000.0,495798,"Supervisor: Dr. Gillian Hanley, University of British Columbia

Endometriosis is a chronic condition that affects approximately 1 million people across Canada. It occurs when tissue similar to the inner lining of the uterus grows outside of the uterus. Tissue from endometriosis often grows in other organs of the reproductive system, which can lead to infertility in many patients. Endometriosis patients also have higher rates of adverse events during pregnancy and birth, such as gestational diabetes or preterm birth. There are several different treatments for endometriosis, including surgeries and hormonal therapies. However, there remains a need to better understand reproductive outcomes after various endometriosis treatments, as the research comparing treatments is still unclear.

In this project, I seek to understand the role of endometriosis treatments in relation to various pregnancy outcomes. I will investigate which endometriosis treatments are associated with higher chances of becoming pregnant and giving birth. I will also examine which treatments are associated with lower chances of complications during pregnancy and labour and delivery. For these investigations, I will analyze data from females who lived in British Columbia between 2000 and 2021 and were diagnosed with endometriosis. In addition, I will interview endometriosis patients about how they considered different treatments if they knew they wanted to get pregnant in the future.

This research will help us understand if certain endometriosis treatments are better for patients who want to get pregnant, so patients and doctors can make more informed decisions about their care. Results will also provide insight into how endometriosis patients decide between treatment options and how they may be better supported in their decision-making process."
Mobilizing a land-based culturally appropriate active living intervention among Indigenous youth,"['Katapally, Tarun R', 'Lessard, Sean M', 'Linds, Warren S', 'Sasakamoose, JoLee']","['Ferguson, Leah', 'Foulds, Heather', 'Guliani, Harminder', 'Robbins, Julian A']","['Active Healthy Living', 'Arts-Based Health Research', 'Indigenous Health', 'Indigenous Youth']",772650.0,358623,"The benefits of physical activity (PA) are far-reaching, and individuals with high PA have better mental, physical and emotional health. However, our population is more inactive than ever and to tackle this health issue it is important to act early, especially in populations that are most vulnerable. In Canada, one of the most marginalized groups is Indigenous youth. Even though they are Canada's fastest growing group, Indigenous youth have poorer health outcomes than others. As PA's benefits are numerous, we propose to develop sustainable ways to improve PA in Indigenous youth and thus, ultimately increase their chances of leading a healthy life. The answer lies in adopting culturally appropriate ways to integrate to PA into the daily lives of Indigenous youth. We have devised an intervention that is not only culturally appropriate, but also novel. In our 5 year intervention we will invite youth from our partnering communities to spend 5 days/year at a tipi camp. In this tipi camp we will teach youth to take advantage of living on the land, and combine this approach with introducing them to active arts-based theatre games. We have done a similar tipi camp in the past and observed that being in the tipi camp improved not only their PA, but also their mental health and overall wellbeing. After the tipi camp we will follow up with active arts-based programs through the schools of these youth. We will assess their PA and overall wellbeing in three different seasons every year throughout the intervention period. We aim to demonstrate that this novel intervention will allow Indigenous youth to lead a healthier, active life.
We believe that if we generate evidence that establishes the importance of culturally appropriate active living, it will change the current state of affairs, where Indigenous youth are left to fend for themselves. We ultimately aim to show that this is an
effective and economical approach to address a wide range of health issues in Indigenous youth."

North-Central neighbourhood's problems are apparent from the Maclean's article. Out of the 9,980 people living in the North-Central neighbourhood of Regina, 44% identify as having Indigenous ancestry. Overall, in Canada, Indigenous peoples experience a significantly lower life expectancy than other residents in Canada due to historical injustices. More importantly, whether the health inequalities are among Indigenous, or non-Indigenous populations, the inequities that drive them are unfair, unjust and avoidable. 

Based on this principle of equity, we would like to develop an innovative, and citizen science-driven initiative that would lay the foundation for revitalization, rather than gentrification of North-Central. A city is a living, breathing, system, and any intervention or efforts to improve health or wellbeing of its citizens needs to recognize the various drivers of health, interconnectedness between actors (i.e., sectors: education, transportation, healthcare). We intend to take this inter-connected approach to develop a scalable systems map for the North-Central neighbourhood that would inform ways to improve the health of people in this neighbourhood.

Principal applicant Katapally, and co-applicants Osgood, and Rainham, are currently conducting a citizen science investigation called the SMART Study (www.smartstudysask.com)  in the cities of Regina and Saskatoon using smartphones.

While there are some smoke-free policies in multi-unit dwellings across Canada, few housing authorities have implemented such policies in their social housing. The proposed research will use a case study approach to investigate the impact of Canadian residential tenancy legislation and policy approaches on the implementation of smoke-free policies in affordable housing, the experiences and behaviours of residents, and levels of SHS exposure. We will use focus groups and interviews with key informants, tenants and individuals on housing wait lists. In addition, we will review existing legal briefs, assessments and evaluation surveys for each case study, and conduct air quality measurements in multiple building types. This is an important issue for population health because secondhand smoke is a cause of lung cancer and is associated with other forms of cancers (e.g., nasal sinus, breast, cervical). Secondhand smoke is also associated with heart disease, chronic respiratory disease, asthma, and adverse health effects specific to children and infants. Smoke-free housing policies promote health and health equity by reducing exposure among disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, and by providing environments that support smokers who want to quit and stay quit. The outcomes of this study will help other communities make decisions about adopting smoke-free housing policies and about landlord and tenant legislation."

Currently, in Alberta, there is no Care Pathway for patients with T1DM (pwT1DM) and thus, both adult pwT1DM and caregivers of pediatric pwT1DM are at a loss regarding their options for treatments and care. Through our Reshape-T1D Study, we have found the voices of adult pwT1DM who express their concerns about finding reliable information for treatments available to them and their need for a centralized information hub. 

The proposed study will be a natural extension of the Reshape-T1D Study, and will run in parallel to our recently-funded AURORA Study (Uptake of insuLin pump Therapy and Its outcoMes among patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus in Alberta) that will provide evidence on issues related to access, outcomes, and costs of T1DM in AB. The Advisory groUp of adult patients and caRegivers Of childRen and youth with type 1 diAbetes mellitus (AURORA) Study intends to form an advisory group of adult pwT1DM and caregivers of pediatric pwT1DM to co-create a knowledge mobilization (KM) hub to house the Care Pathway for T1DM.

Adult and adolescent pwT1DM and caregivers of pediatric pw1DM will be recruited to form the AURORA advisory group. A one-day stakeholder engagement workshop will be held to identify the priority areas of T1DM care. The advisory group will co-review the quantitative data from ULTIMA and provide qualitative feedback on modifiable barriers to care. These learnings will be used to co-create the evidence-based KM hub that will detail the T1DM Care Pathway. 

The AURORA Study will fill a major gap in the availability of information regarding treatment and care pathways for T1DM in AB. It will lay the groundwork for KM efforts Canada-wide and ultimately enhance the health of the pwT1DM and caregivers."

Identification of myocardial injury in the emergency setting using a biomarker panel and the next generation of high-sensitive cardiac troponin tests,"['Kavsak, Peter A']","['Devereaux, Philip J', 'Hill, Stephen A', 'Jaffe, Allan S', 'Worster, Andrew', 'You, John J']","['Biomarker Panels', 'Cardiac Troponin', 'Emergency Department', 'Health Outcomes', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Ordering Protocol']",0.0,183314,"There are many things that may cause someone to feel chest pain; however, what everyone is worried most about and wants to know is if the pain is from a heart attack. This is an important question that both the patient and the doctor in the emergency room (ER) would like to have an answer to.  Not only would they like a definitive answer, they want a quick answer so that the best available care can be given as fast as possible.  

To help the doctor decide if a heart attack is happening, blood tests are often used. Unfortunately, the current available blood tests are not very useful for early identification of heart injury in patients who arrive to the ER soon after they experience chest pain. In fact, experts suggest to measure these blood tests at least 6 hours (even up to 24 hours) after the patient comes to the ER before deciding that the patient is not having a heart attack.  Obviously, this increases the wait time in the hospital before the patient can go home and also increases the overall wait time in the ER.

Our study's goal is to use newer research blood tests to see if a heart attack can be identified within the first 90 minutes in the ER (as opposed to 6 hours).  We plan to test a panel of blood tests as well as newer versions of the current blood test (troponin) in 600 patients who arrived within a couple of hours to the ER after their chest pain started.   We believe that our study will show that early detection of heart attacks is possible and will also provide additional information on those patients who did not suffer a heart attack in the ER, but are at high risk for suffering a future heart attack (i.e., within 1 month as well as 1 year later).  This study will provide important information on these research laboratory tests, bringing them one step closer to being used by hospital laboratories.  Newer & better blood tests are the best options for detecting heart attacks faster and reducing the wait times in the ER to arrive at this diagnosis."
High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin - A Canadian Viewpoint from CIHR funded studies,"['Kavsak, Peter A', 'Worster, Andrew']",['N/A'],"['Acute Coronary Syndrome', 'Canadian Workshop', 'Diagnostic Tests', 'Emergency Department', 'Guidelines', 'High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin', 'Laboratories', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Myocardial Injury', 'Surgery']",24991.0,296284,"In 2000 the cardiology community changed the way doctors' diagnosis a heart attack.  A laboratory test, cardiac troponin (cTn) test, became an important tool for doctors to make this diagnosis.  Over the next 12 years, many studies (including our CIHR-funded studies) provided the evidence on when to measure cTn in the emergency room and what levels should be used to determine if a patient has had a heart attack.  The importance of our work is apparent in that 4 of our studies were referenced by the latest international guideline for heart attacks [Third Universal Definition of Myocardial Infarction(MI)] published in 2012.  

However, as we and others were accumulating the evidence on how to use current cTn tests, the diagnostic companies were at the same time changing and improving these tests by making them more precise and able to measure smaller concentrations of the protein.  This resulted in a new generation of tests, called ""high-sensitivity cardiac troponin"" (hs-cTn).  As these are new tests, information, data and evidence is required on how to interpret them. Also, this information should be provided to doctors and laboratory professionals so that the hs-cTn tests are used appropriately to guide care.  The 2012 MI guideline does not provide any help here as there was limited evidence at the time of writing.  This was confirmed by the recently released Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health report (2013)  that cited the need for ""...further research exploring different clinical algorithms to optimize patient and health system outcomes associated with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin testing.""  Within the last year several studies have been funded by CIHR and the results will soon be available.  Our workshop will bring together CIHR-funded and International researchers to discuss their research findings with a goal to produce a document on hs-cTn testing that is current, evidence-based, and relevant to Canadian healthcare providers and patients."
The impact of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin tests on health outcomes in emergency department populations,"['Kavsak, Peter A']","['Ko, Dennis', 'Ma, Jinhui', 'Tu, Jack V', 'Worster, Andrew']","['Death', 'Emergency Department', 'Glucose', 'Health Outcomes', 'Heart Failure', 'Heart Function', 'High-Sensitivity Cardiac Troponin', 'Kidney Function', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Provincial Databases']",332775.0,370856,"Prior clinical studies and new European guidelines have proposed that patients coming to the emergency room (ER) with chest pain can be either sent home or admitted based on one blood test (hs-cTn) result.  However, we believe that this guideline will miss patients that need to have treatment and possibly admit patients that may not need treatment.  We have published data indicating that the combination of hs-cTn and glucose (i.e., sugar in the blood) is better than hs-cTn alone in identifying patients who can be sent home or admitted in our previously funded CIHR study.  We have followed this work up by deriving different laboratory scores that combines important information regarding heart function, kidney function, and sugar status together with hs-cTn to identify which patients can be sent home immediately from the ER and which patients need to stay in the hospital.
Our new study is to determine if our findings can be extended to identify those patients that are heart healthy and sick up to 2 years after their initial ER visit in 3 different populations.  The first population would be those patients who are being investigated for a heart attack in the ER and who have enrolled in our previous CIHR study. The second population would be all patients that have clinically cardiac troponin ordered, with hs-cTn measured for research purposes, in the ER in one city. The third population will be all ER patients in the province of Ontario who have hs-cTn reported.  We will investigate if hs-cTn alone and interpreted with the European guidelines is better than our laboratory scores at ER presentation for predicting which patients will or will not suffer from a heart attack, or heart failure, or will die at 30-days, 1, 2-years after their visit.  The findings from our study will determine the best pathway forward for using hs-cTn at ER presentation and will be a significant step towards safely discharging and admitting patients to the hospital based on a single blood draw."
Should your tax dollars pay for IVF?,"['Kayali, Tamara']",['N/A'],"['Assisted Human Reproduction', 'Bioethics', 'In-Vitro Fertilization']",3000.0,288262,"There are plenty of stories of infertile couples spending enormous amounts of time, money, physical and emotional energy trying to conceive a baby through In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF). Currently only two provinces publicly fund IVF. Ontario funds IVF for infertility due to blocked fallopian tubes and has done so since 1993 (following the report of the Royal Commission on New Reproductive Technologies). More recently, since August 2010, Québec funds IVF for all residents irrespective of the reason for accessing the technology. Canadian organizations such as the Infertility Awareness Association of Canada and Generations of Hope are currently lobbying provincial governments across Canada to follow Québec's lead and urging individuals to show their support. These organizations claim that publicly funded IVF will result in fewer multiple births (as has been the case in Québec) and will result in long-term savings to the health care system. (As yet there are no published figures to support this claim.)

A Café on public funding of IVF is timely given that the Québec government is now undertaking the first review of its funding practice. This review includes a public consultation and thus not surprisingly we are witnessing a resurgence of public debate and discussion about funding priorities. We anticipate that by the time we hold the Café, Québec's review will be available. This Café will examine ethical, social and financial implications of publicly funded IVF. Questions to be discussed at the Café include: Is there evidence to support the claim that publicly funded IVF would result in fewer multiple births, resulting in savings to the healthcare system in the long-term? What is the best means to bring about good medical practice in IVF? Would taxpayer dollars be better spent on more essential health care services?"
The Role of Vitamin D in the Underlying Disorders of Type 2 Diabetes,"['Kayaniyil, Sheena']",['N/A'],"['Beta-Cell Dysfunction', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Observational Prospective Study', 'Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus', 'Vitamin D']",105000.0,184540,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a serious public health problem, and places a major burden on the health care system. The two primary disorders underlying type 2 DM are insulin resistance (IR) and beta-cell dysfunction. Although some of the causes of IR and beta-cell dysfunction have been identified, much of the variation in these traits remains unexplained. Evidence suggesting a role for vitamin D status in diabetes risk, IR and beta-cell dysfunction is now emerging. However, very little information is available regarding the role of vitamin D status in the progression of IR and beta-cell dysfunction. 

The objective of this study is to assess the role of vitamin D in the longitudinal progression of IR and beta-cell dysfunction. It is hypothesized that low vitamin D status at baseline will be associated with deterioration over time in measures of insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction, independent of important confounders.

This project will be a longitudinal observational study of 712 non-diabetic individuals age 30 and older at risk for metabolic syndrome and type 2 DM. The study involves a baseline clinic examination, yearly telephone contact and clinic examinations every three years. At baseline, blood samples were collected and glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction were measured. Vitamin D status will be measured from the blood samples. A standardized questionnaire was also administered to obtain information regarding medical history, socio-demographics, ethnicity, diet and lifestyle factors. Follow-up questionnaires and procedures at the 3-year clinic examination will be identical to those administered at baseline. 

The potential role of vitamin D on diabetes risk may serve as a possible intervention for the prevention and management of this chronic disease. This will have significant public health implications given the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and the increasing rates of type 2 diabetes."

As the older population increases in the coming decades, more older people are expected to need home care. Home care services allow older individuals with long-term health problems to remain in their own homes. However, home care in Canada is moving away from home-making services towards professional, short-term services for sicker individuals. The goal of this research is to better understand how Boomers will pay for their home care needs in old age. There are two objectives: 1) To examine spending habits of the Boomers and their parents on care services (such as child care and domestic help) in their younger years, which may provide information on the Boomers' likelihood to purchase home care services later on. 2) To use more recent data to confirm whether government-subsidized home care is moving away from serving people with long-term health problems.

This research will examine data from three Canadian surveys: The Survey of Household Spending (SHS), the Survey of Family Expenditures (FAMEX), and the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). Information will be used by the Researchers in their on-going research to estimate future home care use by older adults. Results will also help to inform government about the capacity (and likelihood) of the Boomers' to meet their long term care needs in older age, as well as the role that government-subsidies will play in addressing care needs. This information can be used to improve the health delivery system, by improving what we know about who will use home care services in the future and who may be vulnerable because they are unable to access these services."

Some also receive formal support provided by government programs, home care agencies or other paid individuals. Baby boomers soon to turn age 65 have had fewer children than their parents and this raises questions about who will care for them in the coming decades. This research proposes to use existing data sets and a simulation model to project the extent and capacity of formal and informal care providers (human resources) needed to meet the chronic home care needs of teh first wave of Canadian Baby Boomers and to identify characteristics of older persons who will be at risk of having their needs unmet. Outcomes of the research will help to identify those populations of older people who will be most vulnerable in being able to access the support they need. The researchers will work closely with provincial/federal governments and other provider organizations to seek opportunities to prepare for these increased needs through the development of additional policies (such as public home care programs, tax shelters for care, and long term care insurance)."

Before the pandemic, concerns existed about care staff's high risk of burnout, poor physical and mental health and low job satisfaction. The pandemic placed additional stress on this workforce, leading to serious staff shortages and increasing concerns about staff health and well-being. Our study seeks to understand how the conditions of work in LTC may affect the conditions of care of the residents.  We propose assessing how work environment impacts the quality of work life (QWL) of staff in LTC and ultimately, resident quality of care outcomes in Atlantic Canada. Our region has limited data to understand staff's QWL and what we can do to support them.  

This project is an Atlantic Canadian research collaboration to build evidence to understand, support and manage the LTC workforce. We will conduct a survey about staff's physical and mental health, and key features about their work environment. We will examine the relationship between staff QWL and resident outcomes by linking staff survey results with resident assessment data. Linking data will help us understand if or how the working environment affects the quality of care received by LTC residents. Throughout the project, we will hold engagement activities with knowledge users from LTC homes, health authorities, provincial ministries, and other key organizations for input and feedback about the best ways the learnings can be used. The results from this study will help employers and government better support the overall health and well-being of LTC staff. The study will also build capacity in Atlantic Canada for LTC research and analysis by training local students. Ultimately, our project will provide evidence to support improvements for LTC staff, by enabling knowledge users to consider tangible interventions to improve staff QWL, their work environment and ultimately, the quality of care for residents."

The international set of scholars, teachers, graduate students and health agencies began interrogating the silence and  opening up a dialogue that acknowledges adolescent male body image issues as they manifest themselves in secondary school physical health education settings.  Historically, parents, teachers and educators have allowed boys' body image issues to remain relatively unspoken and largely absent from the regular routine of physical health education. With considerable concern about inactivity and obesity among youth, it is crucial that we begin a clear and thoughtful public engagement with issues intersecting gender, health and education. Aligned with a CIHR-IGH pillar of research, this Cafe will address the intersection of violence and health for a purposefully identified group of adolescent boys who are largely marginalized in physical health education and for whom the masculine body is emblematic of more valorized and more valued and privilege bodied boys in their schooling contexts.

Our meeting is designed as an open forum in which public awareness, expert research, and local stakeholders address, identify, and name issues associated with masculinities, bodies, and body images in health education.  Our goal is to initiate a conversation about a ""taboo"" topic of boys, bodies and body image while creating a space for parents, students, educators, and health care professionals to take concrete steps toward challenging a culture that denies boys' body image issues in education.

An important user of these tools is First Nations (FN) organizations and communities, as environmental quality is central to cultural practices and the sustainability of communities with local resources.  Pilot training, undertaken in collaboration with representatives of FN communities in partnership with the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) and the First Nations Environmental Health Innovation Network (FNEHIN), indicates the usefulness of CAREX tools for environment and health research.  We are moving into a targeted knowledge dissemination phase with objectives to build capacity for understanding local environmental quality, and to enable users to prioritize environmental health issues, identify important data gaps and research questions, and develop skills to create and visualize local confidential data.  Using CAREX tools in conjunction with local knowledge, users will be able to develop health and resource development policies that reduce or eliminate exposures to harmful contaminants, thereby improving community health in both the short and long term.  Meetings between specialists in Environmental Health and Knowledge Translation (KT) from both academic and FN organizations will be instrumental in developing knowledge dissemination and community recruitment plans to actively deliver training on CAREX tools to FN communities in a culturally appropriate and effective manner, and may also aid in identifying research opportunities related to evaluating KT in FN communities."

Going Viral: Keeping HIV/AIDS on the Radar,"['Kelly, Deborah V']","['Burt, Kimberley', 'Pickard, Christopher E']","['Hiv/Aids', 'Stigma']",3000.0,236782,"Rates of HIV infection in Canada, and in Newfoundland and Labrador, are on the rise.  Canadians view HIV/AIDS as a very serious issue, but most consider themselves to be personally at very low risk for contracting HIV infection.  Given that 26% of those infected with HIV do not know their HIV status, this is of concern, as individuals may be placing themselves and others at risk by not being tested.  Research indicates that youth feelings of susceptibility to HIV/AIDS have decreased since 1989, and a majority of students in grades 7-9 are unaware that there is no cure for HIV/AIDS.  Stigma associated with HIV infection prevents people from getting tested, and leads to discrimination against those living with HIV/AIDS.  However, when people know someone with HIV/AIDS, and are knowledgeable about HIV, they are more accepting of those with HIV/AIDS.  There is a need for better access to current and accurate information about HIV/AIDS to reduce stigma, and subsequently increase HIV testing rates, reduce HIV transmission, and improve quality of life to those living with HIV/AIDS.  Canadians indicate that they would prefer to receive information about HIV/AIDS from health care professionals rather than from the media or in school, though few actually receive their information from their doctors.  
This Café Scientifique will provide an opportunity for the public to engage in dialogue about HIV/AIDS issues with a panel of renowned healthcare provider and research experts, and people living with HIV/AIDS.

Studies have shown that community satisfaction increases when policy-makers and healthcare organizations, such as academic health centres, are seen to be willing to engage with communities and are responsive to what they hear. Community involvement can also help address health inequities. However, despite widespread support for community engagement amongst health providers and policy-makers, there is as yet no clear evidence that such engagement actually leads to better health outcomes. Many different factors are involved in health outcomes, from biological and, behavioural to social and environmental. Disentangling their effects is complicated, as we don't have good ways of measuring the contributions each factor makes to the outcomes. Nor do we have a good understanding of the relationship between community engagement and health outcomes.

The aim of this project is to evaluate a campus-community partnership model called CityStudio in two cities, Ottawa and Thunder Bay. Using this model, we will launch projects that address community health priorities that have been identified by each city. We will evaluate these projects to determine what contribution community engagement makes to their outcomes, and how it does so. Communities will be involved throughout all of the stages of implementation and evaluation."
Let's Talk About Sex....ual Health: Exploring Young Women's Sexual Health in the Canadian Context,"['Kennedy, V Logan']",['N/A'],"['Action-Oriented Research', 'Hiv/Stbbi Prevention', 'Qualitative Research', 'Sexual Health', 'Sexual Health Promotion', 'Young Women']",105000.0,416842,"Sexual health is influenced by several different factors in a person's life, including issues related to gender and age. Women and girls have unique sexual health priorities/risks, particularly as they transition into adult roles.  However young women's sexual health has focused on what adults want them to avoid and what is forgotten is that sexual health is normal. Understanding young women's perspective on sexual health is the first step to effective STBBI/HIV prevention in this critical population, and an important pathway to improved sexual health for all women. The purpose of this study is to understand how young women frame/experience sexual health within the context of their lives and, from that, to identify STBBI/HIV prevention strategies that align with their priorities. This study will make visible the priorities and experiences of young, diverse Canadian women related to sexual health and expand current evidence, theory, and frameworks for HIV/STBBI prevention in this population. The impact of this project lies in the opportunity to expose inequities in the sexual health of young women in Canada. Critical feminist theory will provide a framework for this three-phased qualitative, exploratory study. The study will include the use of one-on-one interviews with 25-30 women, aged 18 to 24 (phase 1), an arts-based method in which participants will take pictures related to the study's purpose (phase 2), and finally an action phase that addresses STBBI/HIV prevention (phase 3). This study aims to achieve actionable recommendations for inclusive sexual health promotion strategies. Establishing sexual health promotion opportunities in young women not only has immediate impact potential but can establish healthy patterns related to sexual health throughout their lives and at times when STBBI/HIV risk might increase. In the era of #MeToo, global leadership for women and girls, and the recent launch of Canada's Five Year Action Plan on STBBIs this research is timely."
Fishing for Food Security: Weathering Climate Change Impacts on Health in Coastal Indigenous Communities,"['Kenny, Tiff-Annie M']",['N/A'],"['Climate Change', 'Country Food', 'Dietary Patterns', 'Food Security', 'Nutrition Transition', 'Obesity', 'Traditional Food']",140000.0,392462,"This research involves Indigenous Peoples. Traditional foods (TFs)  confer significant, dietary/nutritional, health, cultural, and economic benefits to Indigenous Peoples across Canada. In recent decades, however, TFs have been increasingly replaced by store bought foods of high energy density but low nutritional quality - including ultra-processed foods, high in sodium, refined carbohydrates, and trans-fatty acids. A major driver of this transition, is the decreased availability and safety of TF related to environmental and ecological factors. Already, climate change is altering the abundance of marine species, while depleted fish stocks and current fishery policies are concomitantly constraining Indigenous Peoples' access to TF seafood, thereby elevating the risk of food insecurity, poor nutrition and chronic diet-related diseases in coastal seafood-dependent communities. While direct links between environmental change, ecosystem status, food security, and human nutrition remain elusive (and particularly little is known about the dynamics of these relationships under climate change) there is a strong scientific rationale and public policy imperative to further knowledge in this area. This project comprises two participatory case studies involving coastal Indigenous Peoples in geographically, culturally, and socio-politically, distinct contexts across Canada (Coastal First Nations in British Columbia and Qikiqtani Inuit) to examine the human health implication of marine ecosystem change. Trough the development of a participatory EcoHealth modelling approach, the study will link marine ecosystem models with local knowledge, as well as human diet and nutrition information to increase understanding of current and future community vulnerabilities to climate change and co-develop culturally-favoured intersectional solutions to support food security, subsistence fisheries, public health and cultural wellness."

The goal of the partnership is to do research in a better way and improve relationships between health systems and Indigenous peoples. By improving these relationships, health systems and the people they serve can respectfully and appropriately benefit from Indigenous knowledge and expertise to improve the quality of healthcare for everyone.
Over the last three years, the xacqanal itkinil team has worked with Ktunaxa Elders to develop and test a new approach to research that is led by Ktunaxa peoples and reflects Ktunaxa culture. Ktunaxa Elders named this approach xacqanal itkinil. We tested the xacqanal itkinil approach in Ktunaxa communities by hosting a series of gatherings, ceremonies and land-based activities. During this process, community members shared their vision for a healthy community; we then worked with three Ktunaxa artists to create artwork that captures this vision. 
The xacqanal itkinil team recently received a 5-year CIHR Project Grant to build off the first phase of the partnership to work towards Ktunaxa Nation's vision for a healthy community. We will work with community partners to co-design and implement interventions (i.e. programs, policies, practices), with the aim of transforming the culture of the health system to better serve Indigenous peoples and the wider population. This fellowship will directly contribute to monitoring and evaluating the interventions and their implementation to understand what is working well, what challenges are encountered along the way and how they are addressed, as well as how this work can be carried forward into the future."

Widespread in 72 countries affecting some 120 million worldwide, LF is one of the world's leading causes of permanent and long-term disability. People living with LF typically experience a triple burden: (1) the direct impact of the disease, (2) social stigma (such as shame, harassment, exclusion) and isolation, and (3) mental health impacts resulting from both the disease and consequent stigma. Current literature is treatment-focused and largely neglects the cultural and social context of the illness, with limited attention paid to stigma and few stigma-oriented interventions. Drawing together an interdisciplinary team of researchers from Canada and Ghana, our project addresses five aims focused on health, wellbeing, social inclusion and cultural understandings of LF with a geographic focus on areas of Ghana particularly hard hit by the disease. We aim to: (1) understand community perceptions, interpretations and cultural perspectives of LF, (2) determine the causes underpinning social stigmatization of people with LF, (3) develop an intervention to assist in alleviating stigma and isolation related to LF, (4) implement and assess the intervention (5) design a framework for the development of culturally appropriate and effective interventions that can be applied in other African countries where LF is endemic. We aim to improve the health and wellbeing of people living with LF through: (1) an increased understanding of the underlying causes of stigma and isolation, (2) the development, implementation and evaluation of a culturally-sensitive intervention to prevent and alleviate these experiences and (3) the creation of a framework to help adapt this intervention to other contexts."

Symptoms, such as burnout, among service providers are linked to lower satisfaction and poorer health outcomes for service users. The health of service providers is especially important in the homelessness sector, where negative experiences can contribute to avoidance of services and extended periods of homelessness.

The rates of common mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, burnout, and trauma, and the support needs of people working in the homeless service sector are largely unknown. This study aims to better understand the mental health and support needs of this population and learn how organizations are or can be supporting the positive mental health of their staff.

This study will recruit service providers in three community settings in Canada: emergency shelters, supportive housing, and harm reduction services. Data will be collected in two ways: (1) an online survey of 430 service providers and (2) interviews with 30 service providers and 15 organizational directors. Data will be used to explore two research questions: (1) What are the rates of common mental health problems and the needs of service providers that are not being met? and (2) What factors are associated with common mental health problems among service providers? It is predicted that mental health problems will be more common among service providers who have less social support (colleagues, friends, and family); a higher workload; less supervision; and more experiences with traumatic events, such as violence and overdoses.

To ensure that the study findings are easy to access and to facilitate future research, they will be shared publicly. An educational toolkit will also be made available for service providers and organizations in the homeless service sector."

In Canada education is a pivotal issue for Aboriginal people because it is so closely linked with good health. Today, more Aboriginal students are attending post-secondary institutions than ever before. However, attrition rates for Aboriginal students are much higher than for non-Aboriginal students; less than one third of Aboriginal students who start university will acquire a degree. One way to reduce attrition rates is to address barriers that currently face Aboriginal students.  Barriers such as lack of supportive relationships, academic challenges, discrimination, and health issues such as anxiety and depression are commonly faced by Aboriginal students. Physical activity may assist in addressing many these barriers. Physical activity is proven to increase academic performance, and buffers against depression and anxiety. Furthermore, group physical activity can build supportive relationships for young people. Thus, a group physical activity program for Aboriginal students could assist in increasing students' abilities to deal with the many challenges they face at University. Increasing the health of Aboriginal students while attending university ultimately increases their health in the future through the attainment of higher education. The goal of this project is to establish a culturally relevant group physical activity program at the University of Saskatchewan for Aboriginal students and study its effect on physical activity levels, supportive relationships, ability to cope with academic challenges, and mental health."

In Vancouver, recent studies have shown that Aboriginal people who use drugs (APWUD) in Vancouver experience higher rates of HIV infection and poorer HIV treatment outcomes. APWUD are less likely to access HIV-focused prevention and treatment programs and addiction treatment services. In comparison to other British Columbians living with HIV/AIDS, individuals of Aboriginal ancestry are also more likely to die of HIV-related causes without ever having received antiretroviral therapy. Although these gaps have been well documented, the barriers to HIV and addiction service access among APWUD have not been thoroughly investigated. In addition, despite elevated HIV infection rates, APWUD report lower rates of HIV-related risk behaviours. Therefore, it seems the current research is failing APWUD, and there is a need for new HIV-focused community-based research (CBR) and action.

The Western Aboriginal Harm Reduction Society (WAHRS), created in 2002, is an APWUD-run organization that seeks to improve the quality of life for people of Aboriginal ancestry who use drugs by encouraging the development of support, education and training programs that reflect the values of Aboriginal peoples. WAHRS has a longstanding partnership with researchers working with the Urban Health Research Initiative (UHRI) of the British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS.

Investing in public spaces and cycling networks can encourage physical activity, improve social connections, and overall well-being. However, there are still gaps in understanding who benefits the most from these initiatives and how to promote active transportation for people of all ages, abilities and cultural and socioeconomic backgrounds. In Montréal, successful projects like the Réseau Express Vélo (REV) and Pedestrian and Shared Streets (PSS) have been implemented in central neighborhoods, but now the focus is on expanding these interventions to peripheral areas and attracting groups that are currently underrepresented in cycling.

Taking inspiration from Copenhagen's successful model, our proposal aims to learn how to expand bike infrastructure in outlying areas and make cycling and walking more appealing to people of all backgrounds. The project's objectives include developing strong partnerships between decision-makers, public health officials, researchers, and city planners to support the equitable expansion of REV and PPS. Specifically, the goals are to learn from Copenhagen's practices, identify elements that encourage active transportation uptake, and identify indicators to measure the impact of REV and PPS on health, mobility, and equity.

Gentrification is a process in which poorer neighbourhoods experience an incoming of money and new residents. Gentrification is an example of how our cities are complex systems. Action in one domain will have repercussions in others. Researchers who want to help urban decision-makers improve health and equity need to consider the dynamics that influence the health of city residents.  An adaptive complex systems approach, where all these dynamics are considered can help to see more clearly the path towards actions that will help the most. 

We can collectively build a representation of this system with researchers from a wide range of fields, and from community members who understand realities on the ground. We propose planning activities that will help create a systems map of healthy cities, with an emphasis on urban transformations, gentrification and health, in collaboration with researchers from different disciplines and based on community perspectives in Montreal.  Specifically, we will: 
1.Draw a complex system map of concepts and connections between urban transformation, gentrification and health, based on existing literature 
2.Expand and validate the complex systems map by consulting with researchers from different disciplines
3.Propose a research agenda for future work to fill gaps between on-the-ground realities and scientific knowledge around gentrification and health

Staff of the Aboriginal Cancer Control Unit (ACCU) within Cancer Care Ontario have been collaborating with members of Aamjiwnaang First Nation towards estimating the cancer burden; however, methodological limitations and small numbers make interpretation of the results challenging. Furthermore, cancer statistics alone do not provide the context of the community's experiences nor do they capture environmental records.

Preschoolers suffer higher asthma morbidity than all other age groups with frequent visits to emergency department and hospitalizations. The economic burden of poor asthma control in children is huge. Multiple studies support the development of asthma as beginning early in life, with the developing immune system interacting with environmental influences.
The reduction of the lung function in infancy and asthma symptoms in preschool age, can be explained by the genetic predisposition (parental asthma) and/or the association with pregnancy (uncontrolled maternal asthma, smoking, maternal attitude towards medication).
Women with severe and uncontrolled asthma during pregnancy are 27% more likely to give birth to a child diagnosed with asthma prior to age 12 years than mothers with mild controlled asthma. If asthma control and severity during pregnancy impact the incidence of asthma in the offspring, it is conceivable, although unproven, that it could also influence disease activity in infancy and preschool years, and throughout childhood. The objective of this research project is to evaluate the impact of poor maternal asthma control during pregnancy on the offspring's long-term asthma control, disease evolution, acute health care resources utilization and health care cost in three Canadian provinces. The project will be particularly important to policy makers and public health agencies. It will be helpful to evaluate the impact of uncontrolled asthma and adherence to recommended treatment during pregnancy on disease control among offspring(s). The identification of gaps will initiate the conduction of specific health interventions (asthma education programs among clinicians and community, drug access programs, parental programs, social action, etc.) to improve asthma control across Canada."

Humans are increasingly exposed to animal microbes as wildlife ecosystems are disrupted and livestock consumption surges to meet the world's growing food demands. The 2003 global SARS outbreak, causing over 8000 cases and inflicting $50 billion in damages, resulted from a bat coronavirus infecting humans. The recent outbreak of avian H7N9 influenza in China highlighted how easily viruses in poultry can spread to humans, potentially triggering a global pandemic. Growing global use and misuse of antibiotics in both humans and animals are producing dangerous drug resistant microbes, which can then spread globally. Climate change is expanding the range of many diseases transmitted by insects. In 1999, West Nile virus spread into North America, permanently establishing its presence and profound continental health and economic consequences. Today, half of the world's seven billion people live in cities, where contagious diseases can rapidly spread. Mass gatherings of millions are increasingly common, with the potential to disseminate dangerous microbes around the globe. Today, front line medical providers and public health officials worldwide are on heightened alert as pilgrims return from this year's Hajj, where an epidemic of a deadly coronavirus (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) simmers. The scale of mass gatherings is increasing as commercial air travel, which transports 2.5 billion travellers every year, continues to expand. Canada is one of the most ethnically diverse and globally interconnected societies. This connectivity offers tremendous benefits but also creates ties to global threats. Hence, there is an urgent need for Canada to leverage cutting edge scientific knowledge and technological innovation to protect itself from future epidemics that will inevitably threaten its health, security, and economy."

We will conduct a rapid review to assess the state of knowledge on mental health among women exposed to GBV during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to identify best practices for detection, referral, and service provision for mental health promotion and care. We will adapt the Cochrane Rapid Reviews method, and will be guided by an equity lens in conducting rapid reviews on public health issues. We will engage in gender-specific knowledge exchange with different sectors. 

Our project's outcomes will be: a Rapid Review of synthesised findings, an Information Brief, an Infographic, and a Toolkit.  We will also prepare a Peer-review Article and a Policy brief. Finally, we will develop emerging Guidelines to assist racialized women at risk of GBV and service providers on mental health supports during the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada."
Modeling the Transmission Dynamics of Chikungunya Virus: Climate Change and Emerging Viral Threats in Canada,"['Khan, Muhammed S']",['N/A'],"['Canada', 'Chikungunya Virus', 'Climate Change', 'Disease Dynamics', 'Transmission Model', 'Vector-Borne Diseases']",72917.0,368880,"The goal of the fellowship is to contribute to projects of the Public Health Agency of Canada's (PHAC) program on assessing risk of emerging infectious diseases with climate change. Specifically, the fellow will assess the risk of transmission of exotic vector-borne diseases in Canada under current and future climate. In collaboration with the University of Guelph, the fellow will contribute to developing a generic disease risk modeling platform. Development of models to assess transmission risk of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-borne alphavirus, will be used as a test bed to develop the platform. CHIKV is a globally re-emerging pathogen responsible for ~390 million cases each year and is a major public health concern to PHAC. The virus has recently expanded its geographical range and caused localised outbreaks in Europe following virus introduced by infected travelers returning from endemic countries. Over 500 Canadians acquire CHIKV each year while travelling and many return carrying the virus. However, Canada's cold climate currently limits establishment of key Aedes spp. mosquitoes, but southern regions of Canada are predicted to become suitable for the vector under predicted climate change. Such establishment would facilitate local person-to-person transmission of CHIKV. We propose to develop mathematical models to imitate the dynamics of CHIKV transmission in Canada under the projected climate change and assess the efficacy of known interventions. Assessing risk by predicting the magnitude and geographical distribution of possible CHIKV transmission in Canada and understanding the efficacy of interventions to minimize the public health impact are key elements for long-term planning for prevention of emerging infectious diseases. The ultimate aim is that the model provides a generic platform to assess the current and future risk of transmission of a range of exotic viral diseases (e.g. zika and dengue virus infection) that have the same mosquito vectors."

Prognosis from ACS appears to vary by ethnicity with higher early mortality in Chinese patients and higher risk of recurrent heart attack in South Asian and White patients compared to Chinese patients. As we know that proper ACS management and health behavior change like taking cardiac medications and quitting smoking significantly improves prognosis, one possible explanation for ethnic differences in prognosis is variations in ACS management and adoption of heart healthy behaviors. The goals of this study are to (1) systematically compare ACS management and health behavior change in South Asian, Chinese and White patients with ACS and (2) to examine potential patient level - cultural factors that may influence cardiac care and health behavior change such as language barriers, poor knowledge of cardiac risk factors, and use of traditional therapies. To achieve this goal, we will follow 1827 patients with recent ACS (609 from each ethnic group) in Vancouver, Calgary and Toronto who have already been enrolled in one of our other studies called ACS cross sectional study. Patients who agree to join this study will receive telephone interviews at 3,6 and 12 months after ACS to collect the data. We will carefully translate all of the study documents so that South Asian and Chinese patients who do not speak english can also take place in this study.  This study will help us learn where the care gaps in ACS management occur in these ethnic groups and also help us learn how culture affects chronic disease management and cardiac care. These findings will be instrumental in developing targeted interventions aimed at improving ACS management in a culturally sensitive manner."

Ethnic groups have been shown to have poor control of diabetes, suggesting that they may have worse adherence to taking diabetes medications. The main goal of this study is to compare how much South Asian, Chinese and White patients adhere to diabetes medications using a British Columbia provincial pharmacy database. We will also evaluate whether these differences in adherence are associated with risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure or death across ethnocultural groups. This study will be critical in deciding whether these ethnocultural groups are in need of more aggressive monitoring for adherence and informing Canada's need for culturally-appropriate tools and interventions to improve adherence."

Information from the US regarding frameworks that they use to prepare for and respond to emergencies are not based on research and it is unclear whether they relate to Canada, with our different health system and government. Some recommendations fail to account for human factors such as social networks. In this study, we will develop a Canadian framework to be used by PH organizations to improve the way they prepare for and respond to emergencies.  Our research techniques will use stakeholders from across Canada to develop a framework for PH emergency preparedness and take into account that emergencies are complex. We will use the framework and a national team of experts to identify key indicators. In turn, these indicators will be used to measure how well prepared PH organizations are across Canada. 

For Canadian communities, the resulting framework and indicators will allow them to clearly assess how well prepared they are and what gaps exist. Internationally, countries may want to learn from our new approach to develop their own framework and indicators."

The goal was to teach children healthy eating habits, and active lifestyle to reduce obesity and diabetes among Kanienkehaka population.The curriculum has three sections: nutrition, fitness, and lifestyles & diabetes divided into 10, 45-minute lessons for grades 1 to 6. The objective of this study is to understand how the health education curriculum is being taught in Kahnawake elementary schools. We also want to understand the factors that caused or prevented the success of the curriculum. The participants of this study are teachers, curriculum authors,parents and school principals. Questionnaires will be first given to teachers in the Kahnawake elementary schools. The questionnaire will give us information on the number of curriculum lessons that have been taught, the number of teachers that taught the curriculum and the number of students who received the curriculum in the years 2009/2010, and 2010/2011. Then, one on one interview with two of the school principals will take place in order to obtain their opinions on the curriculum. A form of group discussion known as talking circle will also be conducted with parents, teachers, and curriculum authors to better understand the strengths and challenges of the curriculum. All the discussions and the interviews will be recorded, and emerging ideas will be identified. To our knowledge, this project would be one of the few studies that focuses on evaluating a long-term school based diabetes prevention curriculum. The results obtained from this project can provide knowledge on the challenges and the strengths faced with a health education program. The findings would be used to make recommendations for revision or development of a new health education curriculum for the community of Kahnawake."

Past studies have indicated that older HIV-positive LGBTQ adults experience discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity and HIV/AIDS stigma, but research examining these barriers in relation to health care access remains absent.  Further, although a limited body of literature suggests HIV/AIDS-related stigma produces unique service needs among seropositive LGBTQ persons, no known research exists to compare the needs of older HIV-positive LGBTQ adults and those of LGTBQ seniors who have other chronic illnesses.  By addressing these gaps in the literature, the study will generate insight into psychological and social needs that may be integrated in the delivery of health care services to make them more accessible to older LGBTQ adults living with HIV/AIDS.  Approximately 25 HIV-positive adults over the age of 50 self-identifying as LGBTQ will participate in in-person semi-structured interviews, along with 10-15 LGBTQ adults living with other chronic illnesses, also over the age of 50.  AIDS service organizations and LGBTQ community agencies will assist with recruitment across two Canadian urban centres (Toronto and Vancouver).  All participants will be invited to share psychological and social needs they have during experiences of accessing care in the context of their health conditions.  Qualitative data will be transcribed, organized, and coded, resulting in a foundation for analyzing implications of the study's findings on health care program development, policy, and research.  The final report may be used to inform improvements in access to health services for LGBTQ seniors with HIV/AIDS."
The intersection of child maltreatment and eating disorders: Advancing the adolescent and family perspective,"['Kimber, Melissa S']",['N/A'],"['Adolescents', 'Child Maltreatment', 'Eating Disorders', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Mental Health', 'Mixed Methods']",165000.0,361693,"Eating disorders (ED) are serious psychiatric conditions that are characterized by a persistent shift in eating-related behaviour that leads to impaired health and functioning. With a typical onset during the adolescent years, EDs tend to be chronic and those with EDs are more likely to live with anxiety or depression. In addition, adolescents with EDs are more likely to experience recurring, inpatient hospital admissions and their risk for death due to complications from an ED increases by 5.6% for each decade they remain ill. They are also more likely to die by suicide the longer that their ED does not get resolved. Evidence identifies child maltreatment (physical, sexual and emotional abuse, neglect and exposure to intimate partner violence) as a significant and modifiable risk factor for EDs. However, this evidence has largely focused on the role of neglect, physical abuse and sexual abuse. Thus, we know little about the role of childhood emotional abuse (EA) and childhood exposure to intimate partner violence (CE-IPV) in the onset and treatment of EDs over the short and long term. Given that EA and CE-IPV can be difficult for health care providers to assess and detect, this may mean that family-based interventions are recommended to treat EDs for adolescents who live in families that are abusive. This Fellowship will provide evidence about the nature and the strength of the relationship between EA, CE-IPV and EDs in a representative, Canadian sample of adolescents. It will explore under what conditions ED treatment professionals report EA and CE-IPV to child protective services; and it will explore the ED treatment perspectives of adolescents and parents for whom child maltreatment may have presented a significant barrier to treatment completion. This fellowship will provide much needed evidence about how EA and CE-IPV influence EDs as well as health care providers' ability to deliver family-based interventions to treat EDs among adolescents in Canada."
Social Networks and Health: From Concepts to Intervention,"['Kim, David A']",['N/A'],"['Epidemiology', 'Global Health', 'Health Policy', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Medical Sociology', 'Network Analysis', 'Public Health', 'Statistical Analysis']",105000.0,257468,"Individuals are connected, and so too is their health. But despite robust evidence of a relationship between social structure and health, the mechanisms whereby each influences the other remain poorly understood. Chronic stress has been proposed as a process through which unfavorable social positions produce poor health outcomes, but interventions to reduce such disparities will demand a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Meanwhile, mathematical models predict that the efficacy and adoption of many public health interventions could be radically enhanced by harnessing the distributive powers of social networks, but the idea has yet to be tested in the real world. In two parallel projects, I aim first to develop new methods to uncover the causal pathways between social structure and disease, then to translate these concepts into novel interventions to improve population health.

A first project investigates the relationship between social network position and biochemical markers of chronic stress. By tracking the evolution of both biomarkers and network position for thousands of individuals, we aim to test the hypothesis that the effects of social structure on individual health are mediated through cumulative stress, and that these effects can be tracked in dynamic populations with network-theoretic and biochemical methods. My research is ultimately motivated by a desire to translate novel theory and evidence into more effective policy and interventions, and in a second project I am leading an interdisciplinary team in designing the first controlled trial of network-optimized public health interventions. By introducing interventions to individuals occupying network positions theorized to accelerate the dissemination of information and behaviour change, we will test the hypothesis that tailoring public health interventions to local network structure can enhance the spread and adoption of those interventions and thereby improve population health."
Examining modifiable risk factors previously associated with breast cancer incidence on breast cancer survival among BRCA mutation carriers,"['Kim, Shana J']",['N/A'],"['Brca', 'Breast Cancer', 'Breast Cancer Survival', 'Diet And Lifestyle', 'Epidemiology', 'Nutrition', 'Nutritional Epidemiology']",105000.0,417012,"Those who inherit a deleterious BRCA mutation face a high lifetime risk of developing breast cancer compared to the general population. Modifiable risk factors such as physical activity, BMI, and dietary intake have previously been shown to increase or decrease the risk of developing breast cancer in BRCA mutation carriers; however, the effect of these modifiable risk factors have not been examined in survival after the diagnosis of breast cancer in this population. BRCA mutation carriers are typically associated with worse overall survival outcomes following the diagnosis of a breast cancer, compared to the general population. Since there is a role for modifiable risk factors in modifying breast cancer risk among BRCA mutation carriers, I hypothesize that these modifiable risk factors will also have a role in breast cancer survival after diagnosis of a breast cancer. Therefore the objectives of this study are to evaluate if the following modifiable risk factors impact breast cancer survival among BRCA mutation carriers: 
1) energy balance (physical activity and BMI)
2) dietary intake (circulating vitamin D, folate, iron, and selenium levels)
3) lifestyle factors (smoking and alcohol).
To our knowledge, this study will be the first to evaluate the effect of various lifestyle and dietary factors on breast cancer survival among BRCA mutation carriers. These findings will have the potential to compliment current treatment options, reduce breast cancer death attributed to a BRCA1/2 mutation, and ultimately help improve outcomes among those who develop the disease."

Through colonization, patriarchy and persistent structural inequities, Indigenous women continue to struggle to have their voices heard and have been virtually invisible in health service planning and program development. Indigenous women are overrepresented among victims of violence, infectious diseases such as HIV and Hep C, and chronic disease. There have been few Indigenous-led interventions which have aimed to improve the wellness of Indigenous women through a wholistic cultural perspective. Primary health care research scholars have recommended equity-oriented care as a wise practice for Indigenous people experiencing health inequities. Equity-oriented care incorporates cultural safety, contextually tailored care, trauma- and violence-informed care and harm reduction.

The current research team will build upon this theoretical approach by incorporating Indigenous land-based approaches. The research team is comprised of Indigenous women leaders in health and wellness. To improve the wellness of Indigenous women whose needs are not met by multiple systems of care as well as their voices are not heard, land-based and Indigenous wellness methods will be piloted to create more relevant health policy, planning and programming. Innovative and culturally grounded Indigenous approaches will be used to promote self-determining and wholistic health and wellness. 

This project will contain two different aspects:
- Indigenous women's event and sharing circle, which builds upon the Village of Wellness Necemat VCH and the Village of Wellness methodology developed by VCH and FNHA (Held Oct 6, 2016)
- A pilot land-based wellness study, which will develop an equity-focused land-based and Indigenous-led and -developed program for women."

Residential schools, the 60s scoop and more recently, the hugely disproportionate number of Indigenous children in care, have created a host of problems centred upon intergenerational trauma - mental illness, addictions, drug use, poverty, homelessness, survival and transaction sex work, criminal justice system involvement, and sexually transmitted / blood-borne infections. We are now in a drug-related crisis - there have been 755 overdose deaths in BC (Jan1 - Nov 30), with 128, a record number, in November and 11 deaths in one night!

The TRC was unequivocal that solutions must be grounded in Indigenous Ways of Knowing, with Indigenous leadership and self-determination being central tenets. Indigenous people see connecting and reconnecting with land and culture as essential to healing. Wholistic wellness interventions need to be centred on Indigeneity, addressing the spiritual, emotional, mental and physical aspects of health in culturally appropriate ways. The proposed intervention has been developed by and for Indigenous people, centred on the Medicine Wheel Spirit Shadow Dance (MWSSD). This strengths-based, peer-facilitated intensive program helps guide participants through self-mapping journeys in which they explore critical life moments and the resulting impact on their health and relationships throughout the lifecourse in a culturally safe, trauma-informed and spiritually supported manner. The MWSSD will be enhanced with land-based healing activities in a retreat setting. The 4-day retreat, which combines the MWSSD and land-based healing, will be followed by eight weeks of reconnecting on a weekly basis, with specific focus on integration, reinforcement, application, and extension of retreat learning, as well as capacity strengthening and community building."

It is focused on Indigenous women (cis-and trans-gendered) who have lived experience with HIV and/or hepatitis C (HCV). Our goal is to help these women with their HIV/HCV wellness and health care needs by developing Indigenous-grounded supportive care. In Canada, the rates of HIV and HCV, respectively, are 3 and 5 times higher among Indigenous people, and Indigenous women in particular, than non-Indigenous people. Yet, Indigenous people have lower HIV/HCV health care utilization than non-Indigenous people. This pattern is a result of the barriers which Indigenous people experience when accessing HIV/HCV care, including the lack of Indigenous ways of wellness and health care. Peer navigation programs, which train peers as support health workers, are shown to help people with their health and getting health care. These programs are not widely used for HIV and are almost lacking for HCV. Importantly, existing peer navigation programs do not have systematic, explicit and robust approaches to address the unique needs of Indigenous people. Because peer navigation is a promising approach to better health care, this study is focused on extending the scope of research and practice on peer navigation to include HCV and Indigenous people, particularly Indigenous women. This study will develop a wise practice peer navigation toolkit for providing culturally safe and responsive supportive care to improve the engagement and retention of Indigenous people in HIV/HCV care. Peer navigation will serve as a springboard to further develop Indigenous models for supportive HIV/HCV care. This study's current focus is Indigenous women in two priority provinces: British Columbia and Saskatchewan. The model will be gender and context adaptable. We expect that the implementation of this innovative model will improve HIV/HCV outcomes for Indigenous people in Canada, and Indigenous women in particular."

We will draw on existing community assets to establish a research approach that privileges and advances Indigenous ways of knowing, being and doing. Our Knowledge Holders and Indigenous scholars will ensure activities are appropriately contextualized, linked, laddered, and culturally safe and responsive.
The proposed research is intended to nurture connections with culture and support wholistic wellness among Indigenous women involved in CJS.

This will be done using collaborative Indigenous research methodologies, creating digital archives designed, owned and stewarded by Nations and/or communities.

Canada is a country bifurcated by complex, multicultural and multilingual identities, and by colonial atrocities and neo-colonial policies and practices. Stories and language play a pivotal role in Indigenous peoples' abilities to maintain their sense of self, sovereignty and ways of knowing, being and doing.

The Kiskemisowin project seeks to address the loss of First Nations, Métis and Inuit languages, stories and knowledges by providing access and support to record the stories of Indigenous people in Saskatchewan, preserving them for future generations. Furthermore, to support Nation- and community-led revitalization efforts, much consideration must be given to the processes, consultation and digital asset management of this project.

Digital preservation, a critical component of this proposal, is complex, and when working with Indigenous Nations and communities. it is necessary to develop shared understandings between the research team and each community on how to best implement data sovereignty and access at the individual, community and public levels. We expect the communities will also all learn from each other, and all of us look forward to reciprocal community-to-community mentorship.

Ultimately, all the infrastructure and wise processes we develop with communities will support Indigenous wellness through individual autonomy, collective interests and creativity."

It is characterized by problems with coordination that causes children to have trouble with everyday activities including sports and play. Older children with poor coordination have been repeatedly shown to be less physically fit than other children. Because of this it is believed that children with DCD are at an increased risk for becoming overweight, and developing health issues later in life. However, we do not know when fitness levels begin to decline. In our study, we have tested 66 children with DCD and 35 typically developing (TD) children aged 4 to 5. We examined their motor skills and how fit they are. We found that children with DCD did not last as long on the treadmill test and could not produce as much muscle power on the bike test. However their heart rates were able to recover after exercise just as well as their TD peers. As recovery does not seem to be impaired yet in young children with DCD, this may be an ideal time to intervene to help maintain and potentially improve their fitness levels."

We need to find a way to increase their physical activity levels at an early age so that they can become active and healthy adolescents and adults. So far, physical activity interventions have not been able produce long-term changes in physical activity and we believe this is because they do no teach children how to be efficient and confident movers. In this study, we will have 30 low-income community preschool classrooms participate. 15 of the classrooms will be taught a movement-based instructional program where we will teach the children many different motor skills (throwing, catching, jumping, hopping) and build their movement confidence. The other 15 classrooms will participate in their usual free play activities at recess. The instructional program will occur 30 min/day, 4 days/week for 30 weeks. We will measure motor skills, movement confidence and physical activity in all children before the program, right after the program is finished and then once a year for the following 3 years. This will allow us to see if we were able to increase motor competence, movement confidence and physical activity compared to children who did not receive the instructional program and if these improvements continued long after the program was finished. Information gained from this study will promote movement-based physical activity programs that will help children be more active and more confident in their physical capabilities as they grow and develop."

In our study, we have tested over 400 preschool children (age 3-5) once per year for 3 years. Each year we examined their motor skills by watching them do activities like jump, throw and balance. We then measured how healthy they were by looking at things like blood pressure, body fat and fitness. We found that children with better motor coordination had better fitness and less body fat, however their blood pressure was about the same as children with worse motor coordination. As motor coordination appears to be related to health even from a young age, it is important that we support all children to develop their motor skills in order to prevent them from becoming overweight and unfit as they get older."

Achieving Healing and Wellness through Cultural Continuity Approaches: Strengthening Promising Practices for Addictions Treatments in an Indigenous Community in Saskatchewan,"['King, Malcolm', 'King, Alexandra', 'Ross, Alex']","['Ametepee, Kehinde', 'Hammond, Chad', 'Iyer, Subhashini', 'Smith, Kimberly']","['Land-Based Research', 'Mental Health And Substance Use', 'Mental Wellness']",1074824.0,444773,"Contemporary literature affirms that colonization explicitly sought to disconnect First Nations, Métis and Inuit peoples across Canada from their land and culture. Our histories of colonization and colonialism differ, but many of us are rediscovering Indigenous Ways of Knowing, Being and Doing. Within these knowledge systems, wellness is more wholistic than mere health, encompassing physical, mental, emotional and spiritual wellbeing. Forced disconnection exacerbated by a number of other socioeconomic and structural determinants is recognized as a critical factor in the current health inequities experienced by many Indigenous communities. Substance and alcohol use is a problem in northern Saskatchewan, with the rate of hospitalizations for alcohol-related issues and injuries suffered while intoxicated more than five times the national average. To address these health inequities, the adoption of community-based initiatives entrenched in decolonizing philosophies and strengths-based approaches is strongly recommended. The proposed project will be based in the Northern Village of Pinehouse, Saskatchewan. Following a needs assessment using community-based participatory methods, the Recovery Lake Program (RLP) emerged as a research priority for the community. The community has identified the need to improve RLP and develop a culturally responsive model that can be adapted and contextualized across the region. This research project will explore improving service delivery by incorporating additional land- and culture-based activities as part of the program, conduct process and outcome evaluations. Using Indigenous CBPR principles, this research project specifically focuses on ways to strengthen promising healing practices for promoting wellness in addictions treatment programs. The results will inform recommendations towards policy formulation, program planning and service delivery for culturally relevant health services and programs for Indigenous communities."

It is generally assumed that the measurement of health inequalities is a value-neutral process, and that the resulting data provide an objective basis for creating and assessing value-driven policies. However, in many cases normative judgments - statements about whether inequality is right or wrong or whether one situation is better or worse than another - underlie descriptive efforts to measure the magnitude of, and trends in, health inequalities. This project examines the role that these normative judgments may play in the production and assessment of health policies. Our goal is to improve the ways that health inequalities data is produced and communicated to policymakers, resulting in policies that improve population health and better reflect the objectives of the Canadian public."

My focus is on the widespread concern about prescription painkillers that has come to preoccupy Canadian politicians, journalists, and drug control officials over the past ten years. The mounting anxiety surrounding these substances is particularly striking given a lack of clear evidence that misuse is actually on the rise (Canadian Centre on Substance Abuse, 2007). My objectives are as follows: to explore how painkiller misuse came to be understood as a major social problem and health concern; to examine how conflicting evidence about this concern is produced and negotiated by key stakeholders (e.g., politicians, providers of services to drug users, journalists, doctors, and drug users themselves); to situate debates among stakeholders within the context of rising prescription rates and the social norms that distinguish legitimate from illegitimate pain; and to analyze the consequences of moral judgements for clinical and public health policies and practices. How moral concerns about drugs unfold affects a range of outcomes, including how individual versus social responsibility is apportioned and whether therapeutic or criminal measures are pursued to manage the problem. It follows from this that the anxiety surrounding prescription painkillers has significant implications for the physical and mental health of individual Canadians and for the social health of the culture at large."

The Iowa Flood Project: Effects of prenatal maternal stress on pregnancy outcomes and infant development.,"['King, Suzanne']","['Brunet, Alain F', 'Davis, Elysia P', 'Laplante, David P', ""O'Hara, Michael W"", 'Schmitz, Norbert', 'Vaillancourt, Cathy']","['Fetal Development', 'Infant Development', 'Natural Disaster', 'Pregnancy Outcomes', 'Prenatal Stress', 'Questionnaires']",1833269.0,172158,"Stressing pregnant female animals result in damage to the foetus, subsequently affecting later development. Studying prenatal maternal stress (PNMS) in humans is hampered by ethical constraints: researchers cannot randomly assign pregnant women to stress and no-stress conditions. Disasters create natural experiments in which the degree of stress may be randomly assigned to large numbers of pregnant women. In January 1998, Southern Quebec experienced the worst disaster in Canadian history, an ice storm which knocked out electrical power to more than 3 million people for as long as 45 days. McGill researchers recruited over 150 pregnant women in June 1998 and have been following the women and the development of their children ever since. Results show that more severe in utero exposure to PNMS is associated with worse cognitive, behavioural, motor, and physical development during infancy and earlier childhood. Yet Project Ice Storm has weaknesses: there were no pre-disaster measures on the women, the sample size has diminished to about 140 families 10 years later, and no biological samples (i.e., fetal and maternal blood, placenta, umbilical cord), needed to test hypotheses about the way PNMS effects the foetus, were obtained. In June 2008, Iowa experienced the worst flooding in 50 years. Before the flooding, University of Iowa researchers had already recruited 135 pregnant women and assessed their psychological functioning, coping, and social support to study the effects of everyday stress on pregnancies. The goal of the current grant is to increase our understanding of the effects of PNMS on pregnancy and fetal outcomes, and on early childhood development. An additional 300 women will be recruited to participate. The current grant will allow us to test biological markers to determine the manner in which PNMS influences development. It will also allow for a thorough prospective follow-up of mothers and children annually between the ages of 1 and 5 years."
The Health Effects of Prenatal Maternal Stress from the 1998 Quebec Ice Storm,"['King, Suzanne', 'Yang, Seungmi']","['Laplante, David P', 'Meng, Xiangfei', 'Schmitz, Norbert']","['Birth Outcomes', 'Epidemiology', 'Health Outcomes', 'Prenatal Maternal Stress', 'Psychopathology', 'School Achievment']",833305.0,344320,"Background. Many studies show that a major stress in pregnancy has negative effects on the unborn child's cognitive and health outcomes. However, those studies have a variety of weaknesses, mostly because researchers cannot randomly assign pregnant women to experience stress. But disasters can.

We began Project Ice Storm soon after freezing rain in January 1998 knocked out power in southern Quebec for >3 million people. We recruited women who had been pregnant during the storm and assessed their stress levels. Over the past 17 years we have observed persistent effects of that stress on their children's cognitive development, metabolic, immune and mental health. 

Although Project Ice Storm shows strong effects of stress in pregnancy, we cannot make conclusions about effects of the storm on the population because we have no unaffected control group, our participants are mostly upper class, and the sample size is relatively small.

Objectives. Our goal is to determine the magnitude of the effects of the ice storm on the health of the unborn children from the hardest hit region. We will then estimate the economic impact of the storm on the province's children who were born in 1998.

Methods. We will compare population data from three Quebec regions: one that was hard hit by the ice storm, and two others that were untouched. Health outcomes will be compared between youth born in 1998 and those born in the 3 years before and 3 years after 1998. We will obtain data on birth outcomes, health diagnoses and prescriptions, and educational testing from provincial administrative data. 

Importance. Although the US public health and safety agencies have procedures for protecting pregnant women during disasters, Canada does not. This study will provide the Canadian evidence needed to lobby for greater recognition of pregnant women and their unborn children as vulnerable populations during disasters, and justify providing specific care that will protect their unborn children."

The proposed study aims to use data from over 300,000 participants from the five Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow Project (CPTP) cohorts to measure the cancer risk associated with different levels of exposure to UVR. Data from the cohorts were collected by questionnaires that include health and lifestyle behaviours, as well as sociodemographic characteristics. The primary objective of this study will be to combine questionnaire and cancer registry data to provide accurate risk estimates for different levels of exposure to UVR and specific types of cancer. Results from the study could provide clarity on the beneficial and detrimental amounts of UVR for site specific cancer development."

Highly active antiretroviral therapy has led to improved survival rates for people living with HIV/AIDS (PHAs). As people living with HIV age, the numbers of older adults living with HIV will continue to grow. The challenge we now face is to respond to the health and care needs of this growing population. As HIV shifts from a terminal condition to one more often viewed as chronic, manageable, and episodic, those living with HIV face a variety of new experiences and challenges as they age. There is mounting evidence of increased risk of a wide range of comorbidities and co-infections for people living with HIV compared to their those without HIV.

The overall purpose of the Healthy Aging with HIV Comorbidities Team is to advance collaborative, interdisciplinary research on aging and HIV that addresses the comorbidities, health-related outcomes, and health service needs of the population aging with HIV, ultimately leading to new ideas and  strategies to improve the lives of those living and aging with HIV/AIDS. 

The Team brings an assets-based perspective to the study of HIV comorbidities to address healthy aging with HIV among diverse populations, drawing on knowledge about trajectories of aging in the general population. In addition to the involvement of clinicians, service providers, PHAs and members of community-based service organizations, and AIDS service organizations, we have the joint involvement of academic researchers with expertise in aging - typically found in such fields as gerontology, sociology, and geriatric medicine - with those who specialize in HIV/AIDS research and knowledge of specific characteristics, experiences and needs for people with HIV. The Team is guided by the principles of Community Based Research and the tenets of Meaningful Involvement of People Living with HIV/AIDS (MIPA)."
What makes people live long and keep well?

Demographic forecasts indicate that Canada's population structure will change dramatically over the next two decades, such that 25% of the population will be over 65 by 2036, nearly double what it was in 2009. The implications of a rapidly aging population are among Canada's most pressing health and social policy issues. Optimizing 'healthy aging' is now a major research and policy goal in Canada. However, existing methods to measure 'healthy aging' often do not account for what older adults self-report as being important for living long and keeping well, potentially leading to misrepresentations about what the older Canadian population actually values for 'healthy aging'. This project will take advantage of data from interviews with over 50,000 Canadian men and women aged 45 to 85 years in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. We will use a novel text-mining approach to synthesize and quantify themes in what the study participants reported when asked, 'What helps people to live long and keep well?' We will examine the common themes across socio-demographic factors, including sex/gender, socioeconomic status, language, race/ethnicity including First Nations status, and province of residence. This analysis will identify, for the first time, what older Canadians across diverse social identities value for healthy aging.  Then, we will examine the themes according to a range of health measures, such as chronic disease diagnoses, mobility impairments, and self-reported health. This analysis will identify what older Canadians with a range of health conditions value for healthy aging. Overall, this project will advance scientific thought by accounting for the perspectives and voices of over 50,000 older Canadians to generate new evidence on the landscape of 'healthy aging' across Canada. Ultimately, it may help inform the development of health policy and services to better suit the needs of older Canadians nationwide."

Optimizing population health and wellness over the trajectory of aging - i.e. optimizing 'healthy aging' - is therefore a major research and policy goal in Canada. Researchers often explore what it means to age ""successfully"" or in a ""healthy way"" by applying a biomedical conceptual framework, and often the general public's perspective is not taken into consideration. However, there is increasing recognition that a lay perspective of healthy aging is needed. Our team has recently used new techniques such as natural language processing to categorize open-text data on lay perspectives of healthy aging in the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging (CLSA), identifying ten themes in responses to the interview question, 'What do you think makes people live long and keep well?' Now, our aim is to look at the characteristics of people, or 'phenotypes' who are in each of the 10 themes. These phenotypes will be based on social, psychological, behavioural, physiological, and functional information collected in the CLSA. Further, we will look to see if there are clusters of individuals based on these phenotypes, which we will use to generate 'personas'. We will examine how they relate to self-rated assessment of healthy aging based on the question, 'In terms of your own healthy aging, would you say it is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?' and how they relate back to the themes generated based on perceptions of what healthy aging means. Examining perceptions of healthy aging, self-rated assessments of healthy aging and individual characteristics and how they are inter-related will help us to understand lay perspectives on what it means to age in a healthy way."

These changes are due, in part, to a series of national public health crises, such as SARS, Walkerton E. coli outbreak, and the tainted blood scandal. In response to these events, there has been concerted effort to renew and strengthen the organization and delivery of public health programs and services across the the country. Indeed, the public health system in British Columbia has undergone multiple policy changes over the last decade. Currently we have minimal understanding of how these recent organizational and policy-level changes in the province have affected the services provided by public health practitioners, particularly public health nurses (PHNs). PHNs constitute the largest contingent of the public health workforce and work to improve the health of individuals, communities, and populations by preventing disease, disability, and injury, promoting health, and reducing health inequities. The purpose of this study was to improve our understanding of how recent organizational and policy changes have shaped the nature of public health nursing practice, how PHNs have managed this change, and the perceived impact on health outcomes and health inequities in the community. Findings from this qualitative study suggest that PHNs are concerned over the changing nature of the practice and are finding it increasingly difficult to be effective in broader health promotion and community development efforts due, in part, to the organizational structure in which they work. This research will provide British Columbia policy and decision-makers knowledge of how recent public health policy and organizational changes have shaped workforce services and, in turn, can inform organizational and policy decisions moving forward."

This timely effort is needed so that our use of dietary intake data, which is often collected in studies funded by public dollars, can have maximum impact in terms of finding links between our eating patterns and disease among different subgroups of our population. This will inform the prevention and treatment of nutrition-related diseases and disorders, consistent with the mandate of the Institute of Nutrition, Metabolism, and Diabetes (INMD) to support research to enhance health in relation to diet.

A Plan for a healthier Nova Scotia aims to create more opportunities for people to eat well and be active. This includes the development of healthy eating policies in places where people play, learn, work, and grow. Recreation and sport settings (RSS) promote health in the form of physical activity, yet the food environment within them is often neglected in favour of energy-dense and processed foods. We have found that for some people, food and fitness may be competing priorities.  In other words, some families prioritize leisure time physical activity over the preparation and consumption of healthy meals. RSS therefore offer an opportunity to align physical activity and healthy eating behaviours to overcome the challenge of prioritizing one over the other. But there is limited research on this setting as compared to other settings where nutrition guidelines have been implemented (i.e., schools). In the spring of 2014, new guidelines for healthy eating in recreation and sport settings (HERSS) will be released in Nova Scotia. This PHIR funding opportunity is ideally timed for studying how these nutrition guidelines will be put in place. In this project, we will explore the impact of these guidelines on the types of foods that are provided in RSS. This work will help policy makers to identify factors that are important for putting these guidelines in place in RSS. In particular, we want to understand the structures and processes that help or hinder uptake and implementation of the guidelines. We also want to describe changes to food environments in RSS and find out what level of of implementation is needed. From this work, we hope to make it easier for RSS to adopt guidelines that help us all to live healthy active lives."

This suggests that more should to be done to create supportive environments for health promoting behaviours that could mitigate obesity risk.  From a population health perspective, schools have been identified as an important intervention setting to improve the future health and well being of children through enhancing learning, providing social support, and establishing healthy lifelong habits.  However, the implementation of these initiatives is complex, and there is a paucity of comprehensive research that examines multifactorial policies, programs and school practices for improving the wellbeing and health behaviours of children.

It is important that these systems understand and measure their efforts and progress.  The province of Nova Scotia is working hard to support population health and health equity activity and action within health service delivery. This study aims to understand the best approaches to assessing the impact of these organizational efforts. This means better understanding how the provincial health system is addressing the health of people and communities while also providing safe, quality person-centred care and support.  The goal for this project is to develop an agreed upon list of indictors that health service and delivery organizations can use to monitor their impact and inform their progress in supporting efforts to impact the health of people and communities.  To do this, our collaborative research team will draw on existing practices in system evaluation and measurement and use interviews and surveys with health system decision makers, health providers and communities that include patients and families.

Vitamin D from dietary intake and sunlight exposure and the risk of cancer: a prospective study,"['Kirsh, Victoria']","['Gesink, Dionne', 'Kreiger, Nancy', 'Rohan, Thomas E', 'Soskolne, Colin L']","['Cancer Risk', 'Prospective Study', 'Solar Ultraviolet B Radiation', 'Vitamin D']",100000.0,206004,"There is accumulating evidence that insufficient vitamin D intake may be associated with an increased risk of developing cancer. Vitamin D can be obtained through synthesis in the skin following ultraviolet (UV) exposure, through supplements, or in diet (primarily through fortified foods such as milk, yogurt, and cheese and through fish). Because of Canada's northern latitude, Canadians may be at particular risk of vitamin D deficiency, and therefore at increased risk of cancer. 

We will evaluate the association between cancer incidence and factors associated with vitamin D status among participants in the Canadian Study of Diet, Lifestyle, and Health, a Canada-wide study involving 74,000 people (39,614 women, 34,295 men), recruited from three Canadian universities (University of Toronto, University of Western Ontario, and University of Alberta) from 1992-1999. Participants completed a lifestyle and a dietary questionnaire. Through linkage with Statistics Canada covering the sixteen-year period of 1992 to 2007, we expect there will be 8250 cancer diagnoses among cohort members. For breast, prostate, colon, and for all cancers combined, we will assess the risk of cancer according to 1) vitamin D intake from food, 2) supplemental vitamin D intake, 3) vitamin D intake from food and supplements combined, 4) type and frequency of recreational outdoor activities, 5) occupational sun exposure, 6) UVB exposure (based on residence), and 7) ethnicity (surrogate for melanin content in skin). 

The study provides a unique opportunity to gain information on vitamin D status and cancer risk in a Canadian population and to directly inform public health strategy regarding vitamin D."

Experiences of youth on the street can include poor nutrition, victimization, low social supports, substance use and abuse, limited access to healthcare and other services. These experiences place street-involved youth at higher risk for infectious diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C (HCV), through unsafe sex practices and risky substance use behaviours such as injection drug use. Resources in social network relationships (i.e., social capital) can have an important impact on the health of homeless populations. It is necessary that we study the impact of social factors on the health behaviours of street-involved youth in order to understand how we can improve public health responses that will lower risk and better encourage preventive practices among this vulnerable population. 
Research that examines the relationship between social capital (i.e., resources embedded in social network relationships such as trust, social support, and group norms) and health outcomes has typically found that the presence of social capital has a protective effect on health. However, there is a lack of research on how to develop programs that build social capital for the purposes of promoting better health. Research has also yet to explore the influence of social capital on health among street-involved youth. This study will engage various types of expertise by involving researchers, street-involved youth and service providers in the research and as members of a study advisory group, to study the influence of social capital on HIV and HCV-related health behaviours, such as unsafe sex and sharing of drug use equipment (including needles, other injection equipment, and crack pipes) among street-involved youth in Toronto. The study will also include the planning of an intervention that will build social capital in the social networks of youth, with which to promote preventive behaviours and engage youth in services."

As a result of inequitable social contexts (e.g., racism, sexism), Indigenous women continue to experience greater poverty, homelessness, ill-health, addiction, trauma, and violence (Kubik, Bourassa, & Hampton, 2009). Yet, community organizations such as All Nations Hope Network (ANHN) will create and test an evidence informed, culturally responsive program - Kotawe (start a fire) - that has the potential to address both the origin and impact of these inequities. 

Our goal is to develop, implement, and assess a community-based intervention built on more than a decade of health research with Indigenous women in which ANHN has acted as lead, co-lead, collaborator or participant. We aim to understand:
1How do Indigenous women experience cultural intervention practices or CIPs (i.e., in different contexts and settings)? (social, environmental)
2In what ways, if any, do CIPs influence how women experience physical wellness through fitness/strength, stress level, aches and pains, etc.? (physical)
3In what ways, if any, do CIPs influence how women experience relationship with themselves and/or spirit change? (spiritual, emotional, intellectual)
4What do women do to encourage wellness in their lives after participating in the CIPs? (spiritual, emotional, intellectual)

Guided by the Cultural Responsiveness Framework (FSIN, 2008) and a Two-Eyed Seeing approach (Marshall, 2004), Indigenous informed qualitative methods (e.g., story-telling) to explore participants' experience, and an evaluation component, we will assess the impact of Kotawe. 

We expected to achieve 
1Evidence to inform long-term funding of cultural interventions for Indigenous women,
2Long-term engagement of navigation and spiritual support; and
3Evidence to inform cultural safety training and pathways for systems who serve Indigenous women."

Indigenous men's lives intersect with poverty, homelessness, ill-health, addiction, trauma, child welfare, dislocation from lands, and violence due to settler colonialism. ANHN is applying past research learnings to develop evidence informed, culturally responsive interventions that address both the origin and impact of imposed inequities. 

This project will develop, implement, and evaluate an Indigenous men's program of cultural intervention practices (CIPs) informed by Indigenous knowledges of the Treaty territories near Regina. Guided by principles of community-based research and Etuaptmumk/Two-Eyed Seeing, qualitative methods (e.g., story-telling, sharing circles) are used to assess program impact for 36-months. Weaving men's seasonal responsibilities into a program of teachings and practices, the project evaluation activities are integrated with the research approach to ensure iterative program development. Research questions are framed by Indigenous concepts of health as both a social and individual experience and explore men's experiences with cultural intervention practices (CIPs) and how these experiences impact participants' identities and wellbeing.

The project contributes evidence about culturally responsive programming for and by urban Indigenous men and will inform the design, implementation, and improvement of future programs in diverse settings. Iterative data collection/analysis informs program development and assesses the impact ongoing and long-term. This study innovates beyond one-off, short-term intervention research and adds to discourses about cultural responsiveness for Indigenous men."
Caring for a Child with Cancer: Understanding Single Parent Families' Experiences,"['Klassen, Anne F']",['N/A'],"['Cancer', 'Caregivers', 'Grounded Theory', 'Qualitative', 'Single Parents', 'Women']",,193177,"Single parents represented 16 percent of all census families in 2006 in Canada, higher than any other recorded census figure in the last 75 years. Brown et al in a recent review called single parents of children with chronic disease an ""understudied phenomenon"". Studying the experiences of single parent families is important because the recent trend towards early discharge and care in the home has shifted the burden of care to parents who are increasingly involved in providing care for their children. For parents of children with cancer, it is unknown how the intensive and prolonged treatment for childhood cancer, which can result in increased burden on the primary caregiver and the family unit, impacts on the lives of single parent families. This study will use a qualitative design, with constructivist grounded theory as the guiding theoretical orientation. Interviews will be conducted with approximately 30 single parents of children with cancer. The specific aims are as follows: (1) to elucidate and to understand how single parents of children with cancer describe their experiences of caregiving;(2) to explore any special problems or challenges that single parents experience due to issues associated with being a single parents; (3) to explore single parents' descriptions of the care received from healthcare professionals looking after their child and the extent to which it is perceived by parents as being family-centered; and (4) to compare the caregiving experience of single mothers with that of single fathers. The interviews will provide extensive accounts of personal experience from participants. Coding will involve line-by-line, focused and theoretical coding. Theoretical sampling will be used to check and refine the emerging conceptual categories until data saturation is reached. Understanding the caregiving experience of single parent families will help us to determine whether and in what areas this subgroup of parents requires additional supports."
Cultural Differences in Future Orientations Among First Nations and Euro-Canadian Youth,"['Klassen, Gillian H']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,324516,"The ability to envision oneself in relation to ancestral cultural heritage may be relevant to how Indigenous youths envision their futures, and may deter negative developmental outcomes (Chandler & Lalonde, 1998). The way youth envision the future can also positively impact development, as optimistic outlooks are related to academic success (Chemers, Hu, & Garcia, 2001) and career insight (Rottinghaus et al., 2005). Since the Public Health Agency of Canada identifies education and literacy and employment and working conditions as two of the twelve key health determinants in Canada (Ning & Wilson, 2012), understanding how Indigenous youth envision their futures, which include their perceptions about education and careers, can provide more insight into the development of these two key health determinants in Canadian youth. By examining both Indigenous and non-Indigenous youth, this study also explores factors that potentially contribute to understanding discrepant health outcomes between these two populations. In this study, 66 First Nations and 28 Euro-Canadian youth from two communities in northern Quebec completed the Biculturalism Involvement Questionnaire (Szapocznik, Kurtines, & Fernandez, 1980), the Self-Perception Profile for Children measuring scholastic competence and global self worth (Harter, 1985), the Career-Related Goal Setting questionnaire (Mu, 1998), and the Life Orientation Test - Revised measuring optimism (Scheier, Carver, & Bridges, 1994). Final grades were also collected. For non-Indigenous youth, optimism was positively correlated with scholastic competence, r(69) = .415, p < .001, while for Indigenous youth, optimism was positively correlated with global self-worth r(41) = .341, p < .05. The findings suggest cultural differences in the way Indigenous and non-Indigenous youth envision a positive future. Future research could explore how these differences contribute to educational and occupational outcomes, and consequently, health outcomes."

With DAAs came the opportunity to address one of the most significant causes of illness and death in people living with HIV. Curing HCV in all people with HIV coinfection could prevent an epidemic of liver disease and cancer, reduce associated conditions such as cardiovascular disease, and improve overall health and well-being. While the end of HCV has been heralded, in reality, the realization of the potential of DAAs has faced numerous challenges. Treatment access is uneven and people with vulnerabilities (e.g., substance use, mental illness, poverty, stigma) may not be able to consistently remain engaged in care or complete treatment- key steps to ensuring durable cure and maximizing potential health benefits of DAAs.  As treatment expands to people who have ongoing infection risks, re-infections may increase. HIV, its therapies, and associated health issues such as fatty liver disease, may worsen liver disease and prevent liver scaring from improving. The epidemic of opioid misuse and overdose means many people may die even though cured. 

Over the last 15 years, the Canadian Coinfection Cohort has enrolled over 2000 people living with HIV-HCV, drawn from all affected populations across Canada. Our multidisciplinary team, rigorous methods, extensive national and international partnerships and community engagement ensure we will effectively address the key remaining questions: How can we identify and re-engage those who remain to be treated and cured? Who needs to be monitored for re-infection post-cure and with what frequency? Do all co-infected people have improved liver damage and fewer liver complications after cure? How can we maximize the longterm health benefits of DAAs?  

Our ultimate goal is to use our results to improve care and treatment and to promote health for all people living with HIV and HCV."

The proposed activity is in support of the 5th International HIV/Viral Hepatitis Co-Infection Meeting which will take place as a pre-conference prior to the 10th IAS Conference on HIV Science in Mexico City, Mexico.

The meeting brings together people living with HIV and hepatitis co-infections, specialists in infectious diseases, viral hepatitis and HIV, gastroenterologists, researchers and those working in community organizations, non-governmental organizations, governments and the pharmaceutical industry. It will address the key implementation challenges to achieving elimination of hepatitis B and C worldwide among people living with HIV and other key and marginalized populations with overlapping risks for both HIV and viral hepatitis, such as people who inject drugs, prisoners, Indigenous people, migrants (including forced migrants), men who have sex with men and transgender people. 

Through a mix of invited keynotes, debates and panels and an abstract driven poster exhibition designed to invite active exchanges between experts in different relevant science areas, policy makers and voices of the community, the meeting will identify scientific gaps as well as policy barriers that hinder faster progress in HBV and HCV elimination. There will be a strong focus on social determinants of HBV and HCV risk for marginalized populations, bringing together different community voices from the Americas."
Increasing the Effectiveness of the Diabetes Prevention Program Through If-then Plans and Mental Practice: A Parallel Randomized Trial,"['Knauper, Barbel']","['Grover, Steven A', 'Joseph, Lawrence', 'Lowensteyn, Ilka']","['Diabetes Prevention', 'Habit Formation', 'Implementation Intentions', 'Lifestyle Modification Program', 'Mental Practice', 'Physical Activity', 'Program Effectiveness', 'Weight Loss']",448654.0,252968,"Currently, five million Canadians meet the criteria for pre-diabetes. Lifestyle modification programs like the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) have been shown to be very effective in preventing the progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes. However, such programs are expensive because they are delivered in one-on-one sessions by highly trained professionals. Group-delivered versions of the DPP are cheaper, but are considerably less effective. We propose that the effectiveness of the Group-DPP can be increased by integrating tools into the program that help people creating new eating and physical activity habits and maintaining these habits in the long-term. Specifically, we propose to integrate if-then plans (concrete action plans that specify when, where, and how one will carry out a new behaviour) and their mental practice into the Group-DPP curriculum. To test the hypothesis that habit-creating tools render the Group-DPP more effective, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial in which participants with pre-diabetes will be assigned to either the standard Group-DPP or its enriched version. In the enriched version, if-then plans and their mental practice will be integrated into each session of the program based on methods we have developed and tested in our past research. We expect that (1) the enriched Group-DPP will lead to greater weight loss and a greater reduction in other pre-diabetes-relevant risk outcomes than the standard Group-DPP, (2) the habit formation in the enriched Group-DPP will occur faster and newly formed habits will be sustained for a longer period of time than in the standard Group-DPP, and (3) the greater effectiveness of the enriched Group-DPP will be due to stronger habit formation. Significance: This research can,  without adding costs, make future diabetes prevention programs more effective, thereby reducing diabetes rates."

Emotional eating is defined as overeating in response to negative emotions. The current proposal aims to find ways to make weight loss programs more effective for emotional eaters.

We propose to do this by using Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) techniques. ACT techniques are increasingly recognized as tools to avoid emotional overeating and help emotional eaters lose weight. Rather than trying to control negative emotions through change or problem solving (which has been shown not to work for emotional eaters), ACT techniques teach individuals to accept their negative emotions and to react to them in other ways than by eating. We propose to further strengthen the effectiveness of the weight loss program by training the emotional eaters to habitually apply ACT techniques when they have the urge to eat in response to emotions.

We will assign overweight or obese emotional eaters randomly to either a standard behavioral treatment weight loss program or our ACT program. In the ACT program, participants will use concrete action plans (if-then plans) to apply ACT techniques to deal with negative emotions that would normally make them eat. In the standard program, participants will use if-then plans to apply cognitive behavioral techniques.

We expect that the ACT program will lead to (1) greater and more sustained weight loss than the standard behavioral treatment program and (2) a greater reduction of weight-related risk factors for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases than the standard program. Further, we expect that (3) the greater weight loss is due to higher distress tolerance, better emotion coping habits, and less emotional eating."

The Ontario Birth Study, with its child follow-up, provides a unique opportunity to assess changes in child development before, during, and, eventually, after the pandemic. We have recruited mothers in early pregnancy and followed them through the pregnancy and early postnatal period since 2013. Over 3000 mothers have participated so far and about 300 were pregnant during the pandemic period. Since 2018, we have followed up with the mothers and their children at 8, 24, 36, and 54 months with assessment of child development at 24 and 54 months. Over 1600 children have some follow-up and over 300 at 24 months and over 200 at 54 months have been assessed during the pandemic. We propose to compare general childhood development at 24 months and socioemotional development at 54 months in children before and during the pandemic. We will also compare how children are functioning during periods of lockdown and school closure compared to other times during the pandemic and before the pandemic. In addition, we will do an initial assessment of brain development in children at 8 and 24 months in children who were exposed to the pandemic before and/or just after birth using a new assessment approach. The information we gain will be shared with clinicians who work with children and with early childhood educators. This will help them better adapt their approaches, if needed, to account for the pandemic impact."
Implementation and ethical dimensions of scaling up HIV Treatment as Prevention: Examining the experiences of vulnerable populations,"['Knight, Rodney E']",['N/A'],"['Antiretroviral Therapy', 'Antiretroviral Treatment As Prevention', 'Ethno-Epidemiological Methods', 'Hiv', 'Implementation Science', 'Men Who Have Sex With Men', 'People Who Inject Drugs', 'Population Health Ethics', 'Social Science', 'Vulnerable Populations']",8000.0,308826,"While various global settings (e.g., Canada; France) are scaling up HIV treatment as prevention (TasP) to use antiretroviral therapy (ART) in order to reduce the incidence of HIV infection among various at risk populations, a variety of significant ethical and implementation concerns have arisen. For example, ethical concerns related to the scaling up of TasP include the potential for increased HIV-related stigma among targeted populations, potentially coercive seek, test and treat strategies in efforts to identify new and early infections, as well as challenges to ensuring long-term adherence to ART among socially vulnerable populations. Using techniques associated with implementation science and theoretical frameworks from the social sciences (e.g., risk environment theory), the proposed study will capture and track the experiences and ethical dimensions of TasP implementation among vulnerable populations within two contexts: Vancouver, Canada and Paris, France. The findings from the proposed work will support ongoing efforts to better anticipate (and pre-emptively address) the features of implementation context and TasP programs that might hamper effective and ethical scale-up.
The proposed post-doctoral fellowship will provide training and support to develop an international comparative study that investigates the extent to which contextual features of health systems effectively manage the ethical and implementation concerns of TasP. Specifically, the objectives are to: 

(1) collect and analyze interview accounts from vulnerable populations currently being targeted for TasP regarding their experiences with TasP; 

(2) collect and analyze interview accounts of policy and decision makers in order to characterize how various ethical and implementation considerations related to vulnerable populations are taken up or rejected; and 

(3) explore and describe how these issues might vary within and across study settings over time."

For example, experiences of school closures and other public venues have had significant effects on adolescents - an age group whose need for social engagement and connection is developmentally rooted and exacerbated. As we move into the recovery and renewal phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing social, economic, and cultural changes are likely to impact the health and social trajectories of adolescents, underscoring the urgency for health, social and economic systems to keep pace with these changes. Our aim is to provide time-sensitive understandings about adolescent health and social well-being during and following the next phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we plan to strike a FOCUS on Adolescents Youth Advisory Committee (YAC) to co-lead adaptations to our existing FOCUS research infrastructure in Canada and France that currently only has the capacity to focus on young adults (i.e., those over the age of majority). Alongside the YAC, we will identify strategies to identify the adaptations that need to occur within our broader program of FOCUS research, including age-based and country-specific adaptations to involve adolescents ages 15-19 in a series of annual interviews (n=20 per country) and biannual cross-sectional national online surveys (n=3,500 per country per wave, including ~1,000 between the ages 15-19). Towards the end of our study, using a community-based approach to mixed-methods synthesis, we will also host one Participatory Planning Summit in both Canada and France with knowledge users (e.g., clinicians, decision-makers) and other stakeholders (e.g., YAC members, adolescent youth organizations) to identify strategies to improve adolescent health as we move into the next phases of the COVID-19 pandemic."

Our Youth Advisory Committee co-organized and -facilitated the January 2020 Summit leading to the development of the current proposal. Ultimately, participants from the Summit identified that knowledge gaps in this area have severely limited our capacity to design, implement and evaluate interventions that are culturally safe for diverse genders, sexual identities and for youth who are racialized and exposed to living on the streets. The current proposal aims to fill these gaps.

To do so, we will launch a three-year community-based qualitative study. Through longitudinal interviews, we will document the evolving experiences of approximately 30 young people. We will also conduct ethnographic fieldwork activities in a number of treatment and care settings frequented by youth who use CM/ATS to further our understanding of youths' experiences in and across these settings over the study period. We will also conduct interviews with 10 stakeholders each year. Finally, we will host additional annual Side by Side Summits to advance dialogue on study findings and inform promising approaches to intervention.

Displacement among PLHIV is an urgent concern in Vancouver's West End and Downtown Eastside neighborhoods, two of Canada's hardest hit areas by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. While the West End and Downtown Eastside have historically housed PLHIV and have a high concentration of health and social services tailored to support their specific needs, both neighbourhoods are undergoing rapid gentrification and rising residential and commercial rents. The recent wave of gentrification is dramatically changing the landscape of these neighbourhoods, placing displacement pressures on PLHIV and the health and social services they rely on. Our three-year study builds on existing community-academic partnerships to conduct a community-based participatory research that examines the link between displacement and health among PLHIV in Vancouver. This study will fill a critical gap in the HIV literature and inform actionable policy and program recommendations to address displacement and improve the health of PLHIV."

Despite diverse regulatory policies around world, little is known about the effectiveness of these policies in improving health outcomes related to poppers use. At the same time, significant barriers exist to applying existing health science research on poppers use due to a systematic devaluing of GBMSM and experiential knowledge relating to poppers use, and inadequate considerations for the contextual benefits poppers provide - notably the facilitation of penetrative anal sex.

Findings from our previous work outline three key areas in which new research is needed: (A) more robust studies examining potential side effects associated with poppers use, with an emphasis on harm reduction and health promotion; (B) evaluation of health policies relating to poppers' legal and regulatory status; (C) research that examines contextual and motivational factors associated with poppers use in the lives of those who use them, particularly community-based participatory research.

The aim of the proposed planning activities is to establish a set of international collaborations at the interface of research and regulatory policy on poppers (alkyl nitrites).

Advancing understanding of 'healthy aging' to support the health of Canada's older population,"['Kobayashi, Lindsay C']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Factor Analysis', 'Healthy Aging', 'Mixed Methodology', 'Social Inequalities In Health', 'Subjective Measures']",90000.0,339361,"Canada's population is aging. Demographic forecasts indicate that 22% of Canada's population will be aged over 65 within the next two decades. The implications of a rapidly aging population are among Canada's most pressing health and social policy issues. Optimizing health and wellness during aging - i.e. optimizing 'healthy aging' - is now a major research goal in Canada. However, existing tools to measure healthy aging ignore social and psychological well-being, which are important aspects of health, and are not sensitive to detect subtle variations in healthy aging between people. The social landscape of healthy aging in Canada is consequently unknown. This research uses data from face-to-face interviews and physical assessments with over 50,000 men and women aged 45 to 85 years in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), a new nationwide study of population aging in Canada. First, I will identify what older Canadians value for healthy aging across diverse people and places nationwide. Second, I will examine the objectively measured biological, social, and psychological factors that might directly influence a person's rating of his or her own success at healthy aging. Third, I will develop a new measure of healthy aging that is sensitive to account for diversity of the aging experience across Canada, using objective and self-rated measures of healthy aging. Finally, using this new measure, I will examine how a person's chances of aging healthily may be affected by factors such as gender, socioeconomic status, language, race/ethnicity, and place of residence, operating alone and together. This research will advance scientific thought by providing a new holistic measurement tool for healthy aging and generating evidence on the social landscape of healthy aging in Canada. It will identify key areas for policy to support healthy aging among today's older Canadians."

Epigenetics is the study of how experiences can ""get under the skin"" by acting as a mediator between environmental influences and genetics. DNA methylation is the most well studied epigenetic mark, and has the potential to influence how certain genes are turned on or off in association with environmental or life styles exposures, such as stress or smoking. We aim to assess DNA methylation in the longevity population of Costa Rica, the Nicoya Peninsula, to characterize an epigenetic blueprint of healthy aging. Our preliminary pilot study results suggest that age-related DNA methylation trends are different in high longevity populations when compared to individuals from adjacent control regions. We propose to expand our sample size in Nicoya, and investigate two other longevity populations: Sardinia, Italy and Ikaria Greece. We then propose to compare these findings with the DNA methylation profiles of Canadians from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. The characterization of biological aging will not only aid in understanding the etiology of age-related disease but will contribute to eventually extending the number of healthy and mobile years Canadians spend in old age."

As changing climates contribute to drier seasons in different regions around the world, W. Canada and E. Africa have experienced reduced air quality due to drought and drought conditions, such as wildfires and dust storms. Drought-induced poor air quality has impacts on the health and day-to-day activities of individuals and communities. Differing physiology and roles of community members will result in varied exposure levels. Early warning tools (EWT) can be created to give advance warning to community members to reduce risks and impacts on their health and daily activities. Individuals with underlying health conditions, Indigenous communities, and rural, remote, and marginalized communities are at a higher risk of suffering adverse consequences caused by poor air quality and need to be involved in the creation of EWTs. This study looks to: (1) understand differences in exposure levels associated with different activities and groups; (2) develop an EWT that responds to the needs of different groups and exposure levels; and (3) explore the transferability to other drought-prone communities. This will be achieved through mixed methods and participatory approach with standard evaluation techniques. It will result in the creation of a tool that can provide advanced warning of poor air quality events, a manual, academic and general publications and presentations, and community gatherings. This study combines environmental, social, and health data to create a tool that can support individual and community risk management of the impacts of drought-induced poor air quality. The EWT will braid Indigenous and Western science so it is culturally appropriate for Indigenous communities and applicable to drought-prone communities more broadly, which can be used to inform policy and practice to reduce impacts of poor air quality."

The severity and the lack of control over asthma during pregnancy pose many short and long-term risks to the mother and her baby. Evidence is mounting for a programming role (effect of maternal conditions on developmental consequences in children) for asthma that may involve the infant gut bacteria, which are known to play a critical role in shaping the immune system during early life. Therefore, the goal of my postdoctoral research  project is to determine whether asthma during pregnancy, independent of and in combination with maternal diet and medical interventions such as antibiotic treatment, may influence infant gut bacterial composition and metabolic activity, and human milk bacterial composition in a large group of mothers and their infants. 
This project will use human breast milk, infant fecal samples, and questionnaire data from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) study. Analyses will be performed in a sub-set of 600 mothers and their infants from three sites in Canada. New genomic and metabolic techniques will be applied to profile breast milk and infant gut bacterial communities. Logistic regression modeling methods will be used to test the influence of asthma on outcomes, adjusting for and in interaction with factors such as birth mode, breastfeeding, antibiotic exposure, and maternal diet.
The outcomes from this proposed project may provide insight for possible programming pathways of maternal asthma beyond genetics. Knowledge gained from this research will be crucial in improving the management of asthma during pregnancy and preventing future respiratory disease in Canadian children."
Impacts of an Unsanctioned Overdose Prevention Site in Toronto: A Preliminary Analysis,"['Kolla, Gillian']",['N/A'],"['Opioids', 'Overdose', 'Public Health', 'Substance Use']",1500.0,380515,"Background: Dramatic increases in opioid overdose mortality have led to rapid proliferation of supervised injection services - currently approved or open in 8 Canadian cities - for people who inject illicit drugs. Over 20 overdose prevention sites (OPS) have also opened, including sanctioned OPS in BC and unsanctioned ones in Ontario, to address overdose-related morbidity and mortality.

Objectives: This paper explores data from the first 4 months of operation of an unsanctioned OPS in Moss Park, Toronto, and examines issues involved in providing grassroots emergency health services in the absence of government resources. 

Methods: Anonymous data on all people accessing injection monitoring from August 19th to November 30th, 2017 were collected and analysed, including age, gender, drugs injected, overdose frequency, and intervention during overdoses.

Results: 2933 visits to the injection tent occurred; 66.5% of clients were male, 33.5% female. Self-reported drugs being injected were: fentanyl (33.3%); heroin (20.0%); ""down"" (unspecified opioid) (15.5%); and hydromorphone (10.4%). Overdose occurred in 3.4% of all recorded injections; 52.2% occurred after fentanyl injection. Overdoses were treated with naloxone in 40% of the cases, and with oxygen, monitoring and/or stimulation in 60% of the cases. No significant gender difference was found in overdose rates. No one accessing the site died.

Conclusions: OPS are a low-barrier, low-cost method of intervening during a public health drug poisoning and overdose crisis. In the absence of a timely and effective federal exemption process, municipal and provincial health officials should consider OPS as a simple yet effective intervention to reduce opioid-related mortality."
Protective equipment in Canadian high school athletes: Can mouthguards and optimal helmet fit prevent sport-related concussions in youth collision sport?,"['Kolstad, Ash T']",['N/A'],"['Athletic Injury', 'Helmet Fit', 'High School Sport', 'Injury Prevention', 'Mouthguard', 'Protective Equipment', 'Sport-Related Concussion']",105000.0,439641,"Concussions (e.g., including sport-related concussions) are brain injuries sustained by over 1.5 million North American youth each year. Over 60% of concussions in youth result from sport participation, with contact from another player being a common mechanism. Unfortunately, concussion can lead to physical (e.g., headaches), emotional (e.g., depression), and social (e.g., isolation) disruptions to a youth's wellbeing. Therefore, sport-related concussion prevention strategies for youth must be explored. Equipment-based strategies are simple, cost-effective, innovative and may be effective in reducing sport-related concussions. Specifically, mouthguard use and optimal helmet fit may protect against sport-related concussion; however, evidence is lacking. The current International Sport Concussion Consensus suggested a 19% reduction in concussion when athletes wear a mouthguard and a recent study demonstrated a 64% reduction in concussions when youth ice hockey players wear a mouthguard. Moreover, helmet use is effective for reducing head injury in recreational activities (e.g., bicycling). For concussion prevention, helmet fit may be an important consideration. Preliminary data in youth ice hockey evaluating helmet mobility, chin-strap fit and other criteria suggests that proper fit is protective against sport-related concussion. Unfortunately, the current literature lacks high quality studies with large sample sizes that assess equipment-based SRC prevention strategies across multiple collision sports. Therefore, this study will examine mouthguard use and helmet fit (where applicable) at time of injury between players with a concussion (cases) and musculoskeletal injured (controls) in grade 10-12 high school students participating in collision sport (e.g., ice hockey, football, rugby) in five Canadian provinces. Understanding the protective effect of equipment will inform concussion prevention equipment strategies and policies to promote lifelong sport participation."

In exploring this broad question we will work with two Métis communities (one in Ontario and another in Alberta) and seek to answer the following questions: 1.) What traditional knowledge relating to sexual and reproductive teachings exists within your community? 2.) How do these sexual and reproductive teachings relate to HIV and AIDS vulnerability? 3.) Since the woman's womb is the 'first environment,' how does environmental justice/land affect HIV and AIDS? 4.)

A picture is worth a thousand words: Examining school-based health environments through photographs,"['Kontak, Julia C']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,324374,"Background:
Comprehensive School Health (CSH) has been recognized as an intervention to enhance the health of children, but measuring this intervention across schools has been difficult due to differences in school environments. Our research involved collecting photographs of the physical environment of schools as part of a larger study on the CSH intervention and student well being.  
Objectives:
To examine the physical environment of schools that have implemented the CSH intervention compared to schools that have not implemented the CSH intervention through the use of photographs. 
Methods:
School-environment data were collected from 18 elementary schools (10 CSH and 8 non-CSH) from a school board in rural Nova Scotia. Trained assistants took photographs of physical features of the school environment. Photographs were separated into categories based on repeated patterns to examine differences between CSH and non-CSH intervention schools. 
Results:
Primary analysis suggests photographs provide a deeper understanding of the school environment and provide a visual aid to understand the school culture. The photographs illustrated different aspects of the school environment, including access to healthy eating and physical activity opportunities, food marketing and visual resources to support healthy behaviors.
Conclusion:
This work will enhance the understanding of how the physical environment may influence the health and well-being of schools and students. At a local level, the results will be translated in school reports, presentations and workshops to support policy and practice changes."

This problem is most concerning for children who are being brought into an environment that promotes rather than hinders unhealthy opportunities; therefore having damaging effects on their health and well-being.

In Nova Scotia, we have some of the highest rates of childhood obesity and poor mental health in the country. It is recognized that the school environment is an important place for children to develop, learn and reinforce health behaviours. An intervention called Health Promoting Schools has been put in place across Nova Scotia schools to help create opportunities that support the health and well-being of children (e.g. availability of health food options, increased time for physical activity). However, there is a lack of understanding of how the different parts of the school environment impact children's health behaviours.

This research project will focus on examining what components of Health Promoting Schools impact children's health behaviours across Nova Scotia. The project will administer an established health promoting research tool to examine differences in school environments across Nova Scotia. Further, discussions groups will be held with teachers, principals and children to understand what parts of the school environment they think increase or decrease children's health behaviours. Participants will also have the option to photograph different parts of the school environment to provide more input.  
The collection of information will be used to develop potential ways Health Promoting Schools could improve upon the strategies and policies used to create opportunities in schools that positively impact children's health behaviours across in Nova Scotia."

Phase I is a study of two long-term care homes, one in urban Ontario and the other in rural Alberta. In this phase we will use demographic questionnaires, observations, interviews, and document analysis. Observations will be of interactions between providers, persons living with dementia, family members. Interviews will be conducted with persons living with dementia (10/site), family members of persons living with dementia (20/site); care providers (25/site); managers (5/site); and professional consultants (5/site). Phase II is the development and evaluation of a digital arts-informed toolkit. The evaluation will be done using focus group discussions with all family members, care providers, managers, and consultants from Phase I.

This study will advance understanding of challenges to supporting sexual expression of persons living with dementia in urban and rural long-term care homes. It will also identify examples of promising practices in this area. Our toolkit will help individuals and organizations to support sexual expression for persons living with dementia in these settings."

We will first study if children with type 1 diabetes develop weaker bone structure. We will also test if development of weaker bones is due to low vitamin D level in blood and/or lack of specific impact forces from physical activities.

We will follow 300 boys and girls, aged 6-13 years at the beginning of study for 4 years and compare how bone micro-structure and strength develops between children with and without type 1 diabetes. We measure bone structure in fine detail at the wrist and ankle using state-of-the-art bone imaging tools safe for children. We will measure vitamin D-level using finger prick test while details of impact forces from physical activities will be measured using activity monitors.  We will estimate maturity of children, measure body muscle size and record details of diet from all children and diabetes status from clinical data of diabetic children. 

This study will be first to reveal if, how and why diabetic children develop weaker bone structure. This study will inform us about the role of vitamin D and specific physical activities that can help to build strong bone structure in children with type 1 diabetes.

Although there is no cure, the risk of developing OA can be reduced through weight control and injury prevention. Also, medication and exercise can reduce pain and improve quality of life in patients with OA, especially when diagnosed early, while joint replacement surgery can help patients with advanced disease. However, we do not know how effective these strategies are in reducing OA burden at the population level. The question is important because the resources for prevention and treatment are finite and decisions must be made about how they should be allocated. In this study, we will apply a sophisticated computer model of OA we have developed to address this gap in knowledge. The model is based on population studies from British Columbia, Canadian data, and the literature. By modeling various hypothetical scenarios, we will be able to estimate and compare the future health impact of a range of interventions involving improvements in OA prevention, early detection, and treatment. We expect that a better understanding of the future impact of these strategies will inform health policies, improve clinical practice guidelines, enhance awareness of the treatment options among patients and, ultimately, help improve population health."

Virtual mental health care (MH) has since become ensconced in our health care system. Despite the anticipated impact on MH and MH care, data examining these outcomes are scarce. Four leading research teams have joined forces to improve our understanding of the MH of Canadian children, youth, and parents and the acceptability of virtual MH interventions during the pandemic within these well characterized clinical and population-based cohorts.
 
GOALS:  To determine the impact of COVID-19 related EM on child and parental MH and family functioning in real-time over 12 months. Further, to determine the feasibility of providing MH profile- and developmental age- specific virtual MH interventions to these children and families, identify risk and protective factors, and compare the MH trajectories of vulnerable and otherwise healthy youth throughout the pandemic and into the recovery period.

METHODS: 6,200 children ages 0 to 18 years and their families will be recruited for participation. Validated measures will be administered monthly. Feasibility of virtual MH treatment will be determined by measures of recruitment, enrolment, and retention rates for referred interventions.

IMPACT: The results of this study will provide the information needed to direct MH care, including virtual care, planning and inform public health discussions regarding the EM reduction process during the pandemic recovery phase and their reimplementation (if necessary) during subsequent COVID-19 pandemic waves."

One important way in which the pandemic has impacted children is through disruptions to school. This project examines the impact of COVID-19 related education disruption on children's MH and wellbeing. School helps children and youth develop interests, autonomy, and attitudes towards learning that inform their self-concept and their future aspirations. Although the term learning loss has been used to describe lost academic growth, children have also experienced losses to the non-academic factors that may be critical to their MH. Our research over the last 18 months shows that simply opening classrooms, while maintaining COVID-19 public health-related measures at school, was not sufficient to improve children's MH. This suggests that children rely on other factors besides academic instruction at school for their wellbeing. We will test the associations between non-academic factors (e.g., motivation and engagement, autonomy, connectedness) during the pandemic and children's MH outcomes among a large sample of children. With few studies exploring the aspects of school that have been impacted by the pandemic, our team of child and youth MH experts will identify the indirect losses that children have experienced that are critical to the success and wellbeing of children. In addition, we will examine whether some children are disproportionately impacted by these non-academic school factors (e.g., based on socioeconomic status, gender identity, race/ethnicity, and diagnosis of pre-existing mental health and/or neurodevelopmental disorder) resulting in greater MH risk. By determining the indirect losses that children have experienced due to education disruption, and the effect of these on children's MH, this study will inform clinical and educational programs to improve children's MH and educational outcomes as we transition to post-pandemic life."

Early detection is the most effective method to decrease melanoma-related mortality. Most melanomas are self-detected and skin self-examination (SSE) results in earlier detection and reduced mortality risk. Although clinical care guidelines recommend monthly whole-body SSE, this behaviour is rarely practiced. Previous research on SSE presents a number of important limitations. For example, the impact of psychosocial variables such as distress, coping, and partner and physician support upon the practice of SSE has been widely neglected, despite general consensus that these factors influence health behaviours and the adherence to medical advice. Further, research specific to the long-term practice of SSE is scarce. 

The current research project aims at identifying (1) subgroups of melanoma survivors who are at risk for inadequate performance of self-exams and (2) modifiable psychosocial factors that influence adherence across time.

A total of 150 melanoma survivors will be invited to complete self-report questionnaires and to take part in an interview at 2 years after receiving a standardized dermatological education on melanoma and SSE. The questionnaires will assess their SSE practice, their levels of distress, fear of recurrence, coping, melanoma and SSE knowledge, and SSE self-efficacy. Sex-related differences as well as cultural differences between Anglophone and Francophone participants will be taken into account. The findings will help to better address patient difficulties in adhering to SSE, which is a life-saving health behaviour. Ultimately, these findings will guide a wide range of prevention programs and education initiatives."

The situation has become so adverse that statistics show that the substantially worse health status of the Aboriginal population results in a life expectancy that is reduced by five to ten years compared with the general population. One of the areas of concern that will be investigated and addressed is the inadequate utilization and access to the health-care system.

The risk of lung cancer related to occupational and recreational physical activity and to dietary intake of flavonoids,"['Koushik, Anita']",['N/A'],"['Case-Control Study', 'Diet', 'Flavonoids', 'Lung Cancer', 'Physical Activity']",300000.0,192116,"Lung cancer is the most deadly cancer among Canadian men and women. Although smoking causes most lung cancers, some people who have never smoked in their life also sometimes get lung cancer. Also, only about 15% of smokers eventually get lung cancer. It is therefore clear that other factors are involved in lung cancer risk. Our research focuses on identifying other lifestyle behaviours that men and women can change in order to prevent lung cancer. 

Being physically active and eating lots of fruits and vegetables have been shown to reduce the risk of some cancers. However, the role of physical activity and diet in the development of lung cancer is not well established. There are different types of physical activity that a person may be involved in, including activity at work and recreational activities. Fruits and vegetables have many nutrients and bio-active compounds that may prevent cancer, including compounds called flavonoids, which are also found in tea and wine. New studies are needed to fully understand the impact of these factors on lung cancer risk. 

In this research, we will examine how lung cancer risk is associated with physical activity levels and dietary intakes of flavonoids. Our research will be based on a study conducted between 1996 and 2005 that included men and women newly diagnosed with lung cancer in Montreal, and a group of people without lung cancer that were representative of Montreal area residents at risk of lung cancer. The interview asked detailed questions on smoking, occupation, diet, and recreational activities. This study thus offers a valuable opportunity to examine whether these lifestyle factors play an important role in lung cancer risk. 

There are many ways to prevent lung cancer and the more we know about the factors that may cause lung cancer, such as poor diet and low physical activity, the more weapons we will have in the battle to prevent this deadly disease."

It has proven difficult to diagnose disease early when treatment may be more effective, as symptoms are not easy to recognize and screening techniques are not efficient at a general population level. Thus, identifying factors that may help prevent ovarian cancer from occurring in the first place is the most promising approach. Hormones are involved in ovarian cancer. Past studies of lifestyle factors that affect hormone levels, including body fatness and physical activity, are not clear. In these past studies, body fatness and physical activity were measured among the women when they participated in the study, which was generally in late adulthood. Some research suggests that body fatness in early life may be more strongly associated with ovarian cancer risk, and thus suggests that exposures during different times in life may be more important. In this research, we will use data from an epidemiological study in Montreal to (1) estimate patterns of body fatness and physical activity from early to late adulthood, (2) examine how the timing of high body fatness and physical activity levels over the adult lifetime may differently affect the development of ovarian cancer, and (3) examine to what extent physical activity is associated with risk because of its relation to body fatness. Ovarian cancer is a cancer of critical importance to women's health, given its high fatality. This project will help in understanding if body fatness and physical activity at certain moments in a person's life is particularly important in ovarian cancer. The results will also generate knowledge important for defining important time points for cancer prevention efforts.

Several studies, including our own, have linked antibiotic use in early infancy to the development of asthma and allergy in childhood. Disruption of the normal composition of intestinal microbiota, known as the microbiota hypothesis, is the proposed mechanism behind this association. 

By one year of age, two-thirds of Canadian infants will receive an antibiotic. While the microflora hypothesis is intriguing, much of the evidence is based on small studies of infants, using culture-based techniques that are unsuitable to detect many bacteria, particularly the anaerobes. Our SyMBIOTA research team proposes to study the effect of antibiotic use and diet on the composition of intestinal microbiota at age 3 months and one year, and the development of allergy and asthma in children. This will be a study of 1,500 infants enrolled in the Edmonton and Winnipeg sites of the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) study. Study objectives will be achieved through linkage of detailed data on antibiotic use and diet in infants with clinical data and bacterial profiles of their fecal samples. The composition of microbiota will be determined using DNA sequencing techniques that will identify bacterial species on the basis of a PCR-amplified segment of the ribosomal gene. We have assembled an expert team of researchers and will be using the CHILD study infrastructure to enroll women during pregnancy and their newborns. The proposed methods are novel and are being tested at the Winnipeg site of CHILD. They will also be used to train the next generation of researchers.

Disruption of the intestinal microbiota is the proposed mechanism behind the association between antibiotic use in early life and allergic disease, but the evidence to support this thesis in humans is modest. Microflora studies in infants have either lacked information on antibiotic use or have been conducted soon after birth, at a time when antibiotic use, especially broad-spectrum antibiotic, is limited. Further, alteration of intestinal microbiota varies according to type of antibiotic, but this level of detail is not consistently available from parent-reported datasets. As part of the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study, a four-site 5000 subject birth cohort study of the origins of allergic disease, we propose to evaluate the effect of antibiotic utilization in a subset of 100 infants on their intestinal microbiota at birth, 3 months and one year of age. This will be achieved through linkage of detailed database information on antibiotic prescription use in infants with their fecal bacterial profiles. Bacterial profiles will be determined using DNA fingerprinting of a common bacterial gene region combined with DNA sequencing. Antibiotic use in the infant will be evaluated against other factors which influence microbiota, such as mode of delivery and type of infant feeding. As this methodology has not yet been pursued, the proposed pilot study is needed to develop the processes for conducting these analyses for the whole CHILD cohort. An eventual objective of this research will be to determine whether antibiotic-induced changes in microbiota are associated with the development of allergic disease in children. In the end, the knowledge gained will inform guidelines for the judicious use of antibiotics during infancy."
Down syndrome research and its future agenda for Canada,"['Krahn, Timothy M']",['N/A'],"['Bioethics', 'Down Syndrome', 'Genetics', 'Health Care Delivery', 'Health Services', 'Population Health', 'Reproduction/Pregnancy', 'Societal And Cultural Dimensions Of Health']",3000.0,263626,"Scientific developments in the 20th century have empowered Canadian parents with greater control over not only how many but also what kind of children are or are not born. In 2007 the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) published recommendations that non-invasive prenatal screening for Down syndrome be offered to all pregnant women. Recently, a more accurate, earlier, DNA-based blood test of pregnant women-capable of determining if a conceptus is at very high risk for Down syndrome (and other chromosomal conditions)-is being introduced in the US. While studies show that approximately 65-70% of pregnant women in North America who are offered prenatal testing for chromosomal anomalies (such as Down syndrome) go on to accept it, experts predict that an even greater proportion will do so with the introduction of this new testing method.
Public perceptions of the health and social challenges associated with Down syndrome are propelled by an amalgam of forces that precede and follow prospective parents into the clinic. Questions remain as to what we actually know (rather than just believe) and what there is yet to establish about this condition against which so much public effort is being directed, mostly in the form of preventative medicine. The SOGC states that ""screening for a disorder should be undertaken only when the disorder is considered to be serious enough to warrant intervention"". Whether Down syndrome qualifies as a serious genetic condition and if it does, what makes it ""serious"" and for whom, are matters over which biomedical, clinical, social science and health systems researchers have various answers and ways of answering. 
Come to a CIHR Café Scientifique to find out how various health experts explain the challenges faced by persons living with Down syndrome. Enjoy complimentary coffee and refreshments and join the discussion of where we are now, and where we should be going in the future, with Down syndrome research in Canada."
Use of Artificial Intelligence in Predicting Opioid Overdose Death Risk,"['Krausz, Reinhard M']","['Jang, Kerry L', 'Kazemi, Alireza', 'Nikoo, Mohammadali']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Harm Reduction', 'Machine Learning', 'Opioid', 'Overdose', 'Population Health Crisis', 'Prediction', 'Prevention', 'Public Health Emergency', 'Substance Use']",19903.0,378461,"In British Columbia, the current opioid overdose crisis has been declared a public health emergency. This means that BC is responsible for mounting a response that matches the scale of this crisis, requiring the development of new strategies at every level of the healthcare system. Roughly four people die from illicit drug overdoses each day in BC. 
While clinical interventions like addiction treatment and harm reduction are the frontline of addressing the crisis, at a population health level it is essential that Canada improves its understanding of information related to overdose and its risk factors. Existing administrative data like medical records from the provincial healthcare program, prescription information from Pharmacare, death records from the coroner's office, and emergency response records from municipalities all contain valuable information related to overdose. Combined, they could create large datasets big enough to use methods like artificial intelligence and machine learning. We propose to develop a team, evaluate data sources, and identify methods that would allow us to use artificial intelligence to develop an overdose death prediction system based on these datasets."
"The Fat Body: Making Sense of Blame, Shame & Stigma in Public Health","['Kriger, Debra A']",['N/A'],"['Body', 'Fat', 'Health Equity', 'Overweight/Obesity', 'Physical Cultural Studies', 'Qualitative', 'Social Justice', 'Stigma']",105000.0,327862,"Stigma against people with ample bodies (""overweight/obese"") is one of the few health exclusions that are still socially acceptable. There are mixed views on the use of stigma in public health promotion. For example, in the cases of mental health and AIDS, stigma is unacceptable; but in the case of smoking cessation, stigma is generally socially accepted as a necessary part of health promotion. There are different rationales for using stigma as a tool in health promotion, and these are related to what the public health community believes is the nature of the health condition. Exploring the nature of body size as a health condition is especially promising. Research with youth suggests there are complex gendered, racially defined, classist, sexuality-related and geographically located dimensions to body size stigma. Research also suggests that youth of all body sizes are affected by body size stigma. We need to better understand the experience of body size stigma and its relationship to these aspects of social justice in order to ensure the provision of equitable and just health care to all residents of Canada.

To do this, my research answers three overarching questions:
1) How do people of all body sizes make sense of the concept of 'body size stigma'?
2) In which spaces, places, and conditions does body size stigma occur?
3) How does body size stigma come to be? What factors contribute to its establishment?

The responses to these three questions will generate new, embodied knowledge about experiences of stigma and exclusion.  With this understanding, we can apply social justice theories, not before applied to the study of public health and body size stigma, to develop ways for public health professionals to include stigmatized populations in health programs and policies. The results of this research will be grounded in theories of health justice and will be directly relevant to making equitable and socially just health policy in Canada."
"The Best Burger I've Ever Had: A Somewhat Radical, Autoethnographic Analysis Where Social Justice and Public Health Meet (or, Considerations and Opportunities for Achieving Health Justice)","['Kriger, Debra A']",['N/A'],"['Autoethnography', 'Health Equity', 'Health Justice', 'Social Determinants Of Health']",1235.0,324178,"Public health strives to improve health equity among the Canadian population. With emphasis on such a lofty and difficult goal, it is important to use available theoretical tools to establish direction for policies and programs towards achieving 'health justice' (I suggest this concept as more useful than 'health equity'). 
There are two broad categories of objectives: 
(1) Health equity practice (""health justice""): apply social justice theories to health promotion strategies; offer ideas of how public health can move forward in achieving 'health justice'; understand and deconstruct the concept of health equity.
(2) Method/methodology: Show social scientific methods' usefulness and importance to public health research.
The physical cultural studies method of autoethnography invites reflexivity, depth, and embodiment to the research process. Incorporating current social justice and health promotion research (literature review) to narrative experience (ethnography), the presenter will draw conclusions about the experience of high calorie food when in poverty.
The meaning of high calorie food is an illustrative example of the complexity of health justice. There are many useful ways to think about health justice, and many considerations for public health practitioners in producing equitable policy and practice.
This presentation offers ideas and opens discussion on: (1) using theory to define justice goals; (2) re-envisioning 'health equity' as 'health justice'; (3) exploring the epidemiology of health justice.
Autoethnography and other physical cultural studies methods are an important piece of public health research, and particularly promising to the pursuit of health justice.
The ideas presented can directly contribute to the formation of just public health policy and programs. The importance of applying theory to improving health equity will be demonstrated. Innovative methods, new to the field of public health, will help create 'health justice' research."

The program of research will focus on three specific research questions: 1) how can stakeholders identify or develop accommodations for workers trying to return to the labour force? 2) how can workplaces and employers support the use of workplace accommodations? 3) how do we measure and demonstrate the health and economic impacts of workplace accommodation for all stakeholders?
The purpose of the included CIHR-funded research proposal is to determine if a supervisor training program can improve work disability outcomes for injured workers. The project will involve at least one large employer in Canada and one in the US. Work units within the companies will be randomized to either receive the training or not. All supervisors within those work units randomized to
receive the training will be given 2 two-hour sessions of supervisor training. The goals of the training program consist of increasing opportunity for problem solving to reduce injury rates, improving supervisor response to prevent or decrease work disability, and improving communication between supervisors, employees and health care providers. Worker outcomes, to be determined from workplace records, include number of lost-time injuries, duration of lost-time injuries in days, and number of days of sick leave.

Modeling Diagnostic Validity Estimates from Administrative Health Data: Application to Rheumatoid Arthritis,"['Kroeker, Kristine']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2500.0,346768,"Canada is a world leader in the use and analysis of electronic administrative health databases, which contain records of healthcare contacts, to measure health and use of health services. These databases are often used to describe people with chronic conditions like rheumatoid arthritis. These databases are very powerful, because they comprehensively capture all health care use by individuals. However, these data are often of poor quality, which can affect the accuracy of healthcare measures. My research focuses on statistical models that can be used to describe the quality of the data. The aim of my research is to equip researchers with tools for choosing the best ways to measure chronic conditions in administrative data. I will be presenting my research at the International Health Data Linkage Network Conference in the United Kingdom; the Network is comprised of world leaders in the use of linked health databases to improve health."

Changing policies and circumstances in Canada leave significant gaps in our ability to provide coordinated psychosocial support to AS. Specifically, the dramatic increase in refugee claims have outstripped the capacity of shelters to provide housing, prompting the federal government in 2022 to open temporary accommodation sites (TAS) for AS. In many TAS families receive few if any services for the 2-3 months of their stay, and children appear to be under significant stress. Scarcely anything is known about families' living difficulties and the ramifications for wellbeing and mental health. AIMS: To understand the perspectives of children and parents held in TAS, and the practices of the TAS, to guide the development of policy and practice recommendations to mitigate potentially harmful reception conditions.  GOALS: 1) Using interviews  and arts-based methods we want to understand the lived experiences of children and their parents lodged in TAS in ON & QC; 2) Through observations in TAS and analysis of policy documents we will compare different TAS approaches; and 3) We propose collaborative knowledge mobilization with AS, policy makers, health providers, and community organizations to generate recommendations for policy and guidelines for practitioners designed to promote the wellbeing of children affected by the TAS. FEASIBILITY: This project is highly feasible because of our access to the TAS, strong intersectoral partnerships, and decades of research on migrant mental health and policy by our team.  IMPORTANCE: This research will shift the gaze of policy makers and practitioners towards the experiences of children and families to decrease the impact of this adverse context on children and families. Our study can offer inexpensive, upstream solutions-that come from AS and the networks who support them-to buffer stress through modification of reception conditions."

Indigenous and racialized women are disproportionately criminalized and women who are impacted by the criminal legal system, experience significantly elevated levels of SAVA compared with those in the general population and men in the judicial system. Despite, elevated rates of SAVA, significant gaps in evidence exist regarding how evolving criminal legal system approaches (e.g., drug decriminalization; police /municipal staff 'street sweeps') shape experiences of gender-based violence (GBV), HIV prevention and access to substance use and HIV care in criminalized and marginalized women, along intersecting social identities (e.g. race, gender identity) and structural vulnerabilities (e.g. housing status, sex work). The overarching goal of the proposed community-based research is to use participatory qualitative research methods to gain a better understanding of how evolving criminal legal system approaches shape syndemically linked SAVA trajectories in criminalized and marginalized women over time and to characterize how community-led interventions may mitigate the harms of criminalization. Amidst ongoing debates on criminal legal system reforms, Vancouver is the ideal setting to undertake this research as criminal legal reforms, including the decriminalization of drugs, and police/municipal staff collaborations to police unhoused populations, are being implemented. This study addresses critical research gaps by examining how evolving criminal legal system approaches shape SAVA trajectories over time and will generate critical insights to delineate pathways through which the impacts of criminalization can be mitigated through equity-focused and community-led responses and policy reforms."

AIDS-related deaths also increased in the region by 66% between 2005 and 2013; in that same time, global AIDS-related deaths fell by 33%. In fact, the MENA region is known to be globally the fastest-growing rates of HIV infection. young people are vulnerable to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), with youth between the ages of 15 and 29 years accounting  for 26.5% of all positive HIV test reports across Canada. In particular, according to the 2007 Toronto Teen Survey, 18% of newcomer youth surveyed stated they had never received any sex education (PHAC, 2010).With over 75% of migrant populations in Ontario settling in Toronto, Toronto has been identified as ""Canada's Major Immigrant Gateway"" by the province of Ontario. There is a dearth of recent research on the unique challenges that youth from MENA communities face when accessing health and social services in the Canadian context. Evidence of these sexual health disparities points to the need for research to examine the contexts and local-global influences on sexual practices among different youth groups from MENA communities in Ontario, across Canada and globally to generate knowledge and develop interventions that draw on individual and structural approaches."

The rise in new HIV infections since 2001 has put the MENA region among the top two regions with the fastest growing rates of HIV infections globally, where the spread of HIV is hastened by conflicts, and economic upheavals that upset social stability.  These global trends have implications in the Canadian landscape. In Canada, the influx of newcomer and refugee youth from the MENA region adds to the vulnerability, given unemployment, language barriers, and limited social support. Structural barriers further burden youth, especially sexual and gender minority youth, immigrants, and refugees, as they experience social and economic marginalization. To address these gaps, we propose to develop national collaborations with stakeholders and AIDS Service providers in Ontario (ON) and British Columbia (BC) who serve MENA diasporic communities. We aim to bring together MENA youth, community leaders, service providers, and key informants to: (i) disseminate the results from our recent research study involving an online survey of 239 MENA youth in ON and BC and share findings from our newly-conducted rapid literature review and program scan on HIV prevention interventions; (ii) engage community stakeholders in dialogue about the findings from the survey results and rapid review and program scan and seek their responses/input on STI/HIV prevention interventions specific to their communities; (iii) engage community stakeholders to identify key aspects of effective HIV prevention interventions to address gaps in HIV/AIDS prevention among diaspora MENA youth in ON and BC; and (iv) build a multidisciplinary research team, MENA youth sexual health research network,  to develop a multi-year CIHR grant proposal to design, pilot, and evaluate an HIV intervention prevention."

The burden of obesity is disproportionately experienced by children from lower income families. Regulated centre-based childcare has been identified as a promising environment to support child health in early life. Centre-based childcare provides children nutritious food, structured routines, physical activity, learning, socialization, and care from licensed early childhood educators. Quality centre-based childcare in the preschool years may be a promising intervention to support child health. However, access to centre-based childcare is challenging for many low-income families due to cost and acquisition barriers. The Canadian government has invested in improving the affordability and availability of regulated childcare. However, the impacts of centre-based childcare in early childhood on child health, growth, and nutrition are unknown. My research aims to address these knowledge gaps and evaluate the relationships between centre-based childcare and child growth and nutrition through patient-oriented studies. These studies are embedded within a clinical trial (NuRISH) to determine if support from a childcare navigator provided to low-income families during the first year of life can increase access to quality centre-based childcare by 1 year of age, as well as reduce the risk of childhood obesity and improve dietary quality at 2 years of age. The childcare navigator will help families access financial subsidies and obtain quality centre-based childcare. This innovative clinical trial will leverage Canada's largest practice-based research network for children (TARGet Kids!). Findings hold promise to inform childcare policy, early childhood health interventions, and clinical practice. This research aims to encourage community engagement and support the potential bridge between primary healthcare and childcare sectors to improve the lives of Canadian children and their families."

However, this diversity may also mean that Canadians will have different health risks and health problems. Even though new immigrants may define themselves as ""Canadian,"" their home environment may result in different health risks for them compared to other new immigrants, or even those who have grown up in Canada. This may be magnified among youth, who rely heavily on their parents for guidance and support.

This study of Canadian young people will investigate differences between ethnicities for 1) physical activity and obesity, and 2) violence and intentional injury. We will also explore the effect of the ethnic composition of communities on youth. To conduct this study, we will use the Health Behaviours in School-Aged Children survey, which is a national survey of 25,000 children in 500 schools in all provinces and territories in Canada. This study will be the main focus of my Ph.D.

The results from my Ph.D. can be used by policymakers to improve programs aimed at new immigrants to Canada. For example, if we saw that certain ethnic groups had higher injury rates, we could investigate why and prevent this from happening. The outcomes I am interested in (physical activity, obesity, violence and injury) are important to investigate as they can have serious long-term consequences for our youth."

We will apply a sex and gender based analysis plus (SGBA+) approach to identify vulnerable population sub-groups. We will conduct spatial and trend analyses of survey data and thematic analysis of qualitative data to characterize individual and health systems level responses to COVID-19 and estimate gaps in malaria intervention coverage. We will use simulation models to estimate the potential impacts of changes in malaria control on the burden of malaria disease and death using the 'OpenMalaria' simulator of malaria epidemiology and control.

Meanwhile, for many years now, there have been calls from various stakeholders to address issues related to gender and broader structural challenges affecting vulnerable workers in Canadian society (e.g., racialized women, issues related to pay equity; childcare services). Thus, in exploring the impacts and responses to COVID-19 in relation to racialized and immigrant women, this project is urgent and timely, and will produce original and significant work (both for scholarship and practice) by filling key gaps.  Specifically, it will examine how social and economic realities, as well as mental health of racialized and immigrant women have been impacted by the pandemic. Second, the study will examine coping strategies adopted by racialized and immigrant women to manage the impacts of the pandemic on the mental health as well as social and economic well-being. Third, we also examine how strategies and programs implemented in response to COVID-19 by government institutions and employers were useful racialized and immigrant essential workers in the context of their mental health, social and economic realities. In so doing, this research will address an immediate problem, but also provide empirical evidence to begin to address longer-term structural issues. The study employs an embodied inquiry in the form of storytelling to understand how this group of women are navigating the pandemic at the site of work."

Research indicates that this transition is challenging and stressful - academically, emotionally and socially - and can have negative impacts on mental health and wellbeing during what is an important developmental period. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, the incoming 2020 cohort of first-year students will face heightened and new challenges. Most will have spent the conclusion of high school learning virtually while in quarantine in an uncertain and difficult time, to then experience their first year of university living, learning and socializing off-campus, virtually and remotely. In response to COVID-19 and with an appreciation of the considerable stresses students face generally, and particularly in 2020-21 and the potential effects on mental health and well-being, McMaster University has developed an innovative program to support students, entitled Archway. This initiative has been developed to help prevent and intervene early to address common transitional issues for students, which can influence mental health and well-being, aiming to increase: student connectedness (sense of belonging), student supports (opportunities and programs to promote academic success, social-emotional learning and positive health and wellbeing); and student retention (academic success). The current proposal aims to evaluate Archway, to gain a better understanding the transition into first-year for those students who engage and participate in Archway at various levels. The study will not only help to determine the effect of this program for students during COVID-19, but it will help us to better understand the challenges of this transition broadly and to inform future efforts to support students and protect mental health and wellbeing, using virtual and remote platforms and mechanisms to meet the increasingly diverse needs and circumstances of students."
Trajectories of physical activity and its impact on health among Canadians,"['Kwan, Matthew']","['Brown, Denver M', 'Cairney, John', 'Kitchen, Peter']","['Group-Based Trajectory Modeling', 'National Population Health Survey', 'Physical Activity', 'Physical Health', 'Secondary Analysis']",86157.0,421819,"Physical inactivity is becoming one of the most critical public health issues. Accumulating evidence indicates that physical activity (PA) is critical in the prevention of many chronic health diseases, including some forms of cancer. Despite the benefits, statistics show that the majority of the developed world is insufficiently active. In Canada, self-reported data finds that half the population fails to meet recommended levels of PA. One problem is that our knowledge of PA as it relates to health outcomes (including cancer) is largely based on PA assessed at one point only. This is limiting as we know PA measured at one time point is not entirely indicative of future behaviours. Importantly, we have little knowledge of how sustained levels of PA or inactivity relates to health outcomes. Therefore, we are proposing to use a national health dataset to examine how PA patterns over a 20-year period are associated with the health of Canadians. We will use data from the National Population Health Survey that began in 1994/1995 and re-assesses the same person every other year. This study will enable us to discern the different long-term patterns of PA behaviours among different segments of the Canadian population (e.g., there may be some who are active throughout this period, while there may be some that began active but decline in their PA participation over time). Once the patterns of behaviours are established, we will determine (a) what demographic factors are related to these patterns and (b) how these behavioural patterns predict health outcomes of diagnoses of cancers, self-reported health, and mortality. Identifying the different patterns of behaviours among Canadians will make it possible to uncover groups who are most susceptible to physical inactivity, and to gain a better understanding of how PA over time influences the health of Canadians, including the significance of PA health behaviour that can be modified for cancer diagnoses."
Generating evidence to support influenza immunization,"['Kwong, Jeffrey C']",['N/A'],"['Epidemiology', 'Influenza Vaccines', 'Public Health', 'Vaccine Effectiveness', 'Vaccine Program Delivery', 'Vaccine Safety']",,297432,"Influenza (the flu) makes a lot of people sick each year. Vaccines are the main strategy to prevent influenza, but many people avoid them due to concerns about how well they work, how safe they are, and how and where they are given. My research program will assess various aspects of influenza vaccines, with the goal of creating evidence to support influenza immunization.
Young children, elderly adults, and those with chronic illnesses are among the high-risk groups that are more likely to be hospitalized or die from influenza. The first objective is to study how well influenza vaccines work to protect these groups of people from being hospitalized or dying from influenza. Because the vaccine changes every year, ongoing monitoring of effectiveness is important to maintain confidence in the vaccine.
Recent studies have raised concerns that the vaccines used during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic may cause a serious sleep disorder called narcolepsy. A compound known as an adjuvant, used to boost the effectiveness of a vaccine and reduce the amount of precious antigens required per vaccine, has been implicated as the cause. The second objective is to study the relationship between H1N1 pandemic vaccines and narcolepsy. Since we may need to use adjuvants in future pandemic vaccines, we must understand their harms before the next pandemic.
Children drive influenza outbreaks by spreading it to peers and family members. Vaccinating children may reduce influenza in a community. Giving influenza vaccines in schools may be convenient for parents, but children may be afraid of needles. An alternative to traditional injected vaccines (flu shots) is the newer, more effective nasal spray vaccine (FluMist). The third objective is to compare giving FluMist and flu shots to children through schools, and look at uptake, acceptability, cost, and influenza infection rates among children and their household members. These results will shape future influenza vaccine policy."

The Ontario Burden of Infectious Diseases Study found that in a population of 12.2 million, infectious diseases cause over 7 million healthcare episodes and nearly 5,400 deaths each year. Vaccines are among the greatest achievements in public health, preventing many infectious diseases. My research involves studying patterns of infectious diseases and the impact that vaccines have, both at the level of individuals and in populations, so that we can better prevent these diseases. Linking records about individuals across multiple databases (while maintaining the privacy of the individuals) is very useful for research studies. These linkable databases have been used in many studies about heart disease, cancer, and drug safety, but they have not been used as much for infectious diseases. My research will use many different databases, including healthcare records (e.g., hospitalizations, visits to doctors), information from telephone surveys, and laboratory results to answer important questions about infectious diseases. I will do research in four main areas: 1) understanding patterns of influenza (the ""flu"") and influenza vaccines (""flu shots""), in particular whether there are differences in the frequency of influenza and other types of infections between various ethnic groups, and measuring how well influenza vaccines work in seniors; 2) ranking various infectious diseases in terms of their impact on the health of the population and estimating how much infectious diseases cost to the healthcare system; 3) understanding patterns of healthcare use for some other infectious diseases such as HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) and hepatitis B and C; and 4) improving the way influenza vaccination programs are delivered in Canada. This research will improve care for patients as well as the delivery of public health programs, so that the impact of infectious diseases can be reduced for all Canadians."

As an example, the Ontario Burden of Infectious Diseases Study found that in a population of 12.2 million people, infectious diseases cause over 7 million healthcare episodes and nearly 5,400 deaths each year. Canada is home to many different ethnic groups, with 16% of the population belonging to a visible minority (i.e., non-White) group as of 2006, and this is expected to double to 29-32% by 2031. Certain ethnic groups are more likely to have chronic medical conditions such as heart disease and diabetes. Previous studies suggest that there may also be differences between ethnic groups in terms of infectious diseases. The goals of this research are to see if there are differences between ethnic groups in terms of healthcare use for several types of infections, and to understand the mechanisms that might explain these differences. In particular, we want to know if socio-economic status (e.g., income, education), lifestyle behaviours (e.g., diet, exercise, smoking), and medical conditions (e.g., diabetes, asthma) explain any differences that exist. We will use information from telephone surveys and healthcare records for hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and doctors' office visits from Ontario to do this research. We will also account for many other factors that might affect the relationship between ethnicity and infections. This research will improve our understanding of how ethnicity relates to health, so that better ways to prevent infectious diseases can be developed."

Influenza vaccines are highly recommended for older adults, but vaccine coverage in this population is suboptimal (only ~60% in Canada, and trending downward). Numerous studies have shown that influenza vaccines prevent laboratory-confirmed influenza in both outpatient and inpatient settings during most influenza seasons. However, rigorous evidence that influenza vaccines prevent laboratory-confirmed influenza mortality is surprisingly scarce. High-quality evidence of effectiveness against this outcome is needed.

Another potential strategy for mitigating severe influenza infections is the use of statin medications. In addition to lowering cholesterol, statins have wide-ranging effects on the immune system, and they have been proposed for use during influenza pandemics to decrease the inappropriate inflammation that is sometimes seen with severe infections. A recent study found that statin users were less likely to experience laboratory-confirmed infection by H3N2 influenza viruses. On the other hand, that study and two others found statin use seems to decrease the effectiveness of influenza vaccines. Since many older adults take statins, and older adults are recommended to receive influenza vaccines, it is important to sort out the complex relationship between statin use, influenza vaccines, and influenza outcomes."
Examining gender-related differential item functioning of the Veterans Rand 12 Health Survey,"['Kwon, Jae-Yung']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,351899,"Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are powerful evidence-informed multi-item scales used as tools to ensure our healthcare services are responsive to the unique needs of older adults and continue to provide high quality care. PROMs are used by patients to describe how they feel about their health and quality of life. As medical innovations transform the delivery and type of health services available, PROMs are increasingly needed. Despite tremendous interest to integrate PROMs into health services evaluations and comparative effectiveness research, little work has examined gender-based differences using differential item functioning (DIF). DIF arises when patients with the same underlying health status do not interpret the scale items in the same way, which is a major threat to the validity of PROMs. Previous research suggests females are more likely to endorse items that describe emotions of vulnerability while males were more likely to endorse items of physical activity. Thus, items of different endorsements may inflate negative scores at the scale level for women compared to men, which can lead to inaccurate evaluations, ultimately leading PROMs to produce irrelevant evidence for tailored decision-making. Our study remedies this gap by examining the extent to which group membership of gender affect item responses in PROMs. Using innovative item response theory models that test for DIF, data from the 2010 Health Outcomes Survey (pertaining to Medicare beneficiaries) will be analyzed. PROMs will be assessed using the Veterans Rand 12 Health Survey. There are plans to use this survey to assess population health across Canada. The findings of this study will contribute to valid, comparable PROMs data to ensure that healthcare services lead to better outcomes and are equally beneficial to all Canadians."

Canadians eating SFs may also be at risk of consuming unsafe levels of some nutrients, especially if they are also taking supplements. We do not know who actually uses SFs in Canada, why they do so, and if they can use the information on SF food labels to tell them apart from regular foods and use these products safely.

This review examines the relationships between First Nations and the federal government in terms of the delivery of health services; an area of Canadian public policy that has also experienced a fairly high level of change over the last century.

Delivery of health services to First Nations has evolved from direct services by federal employees, mostly nurses, to increased delivery of health services by First Nations. This evolution in service delivery is based on the 1979 Indian Health Policy, the 1989 Transfer Policy and more recently from partnerships endeavours such as the BC Tripartite Framework Agreement on First Nations Health Governance. Across the country, First Nations are looking at options for establishing and/or strengthening partnerships with federal and provincial governments as well as health authorities.

Literature on concepts of collaboration sometimes refer to unequal relationships, but limited attention seems to have been given to the concept of working together in situations where there is a special relationship with the Crown. How can we, First Nations and governments, work together and succeed in improving access and quality of health services, and ultimately health outcomes?  What would be the key ingredients for success?  This review begins to examine a few options including trust, commitment, collaborative capacity and a changing role for public service managers."

This population includes women fleeing domestic violence, runaway youth or even people in economic hardship among others. These people generally have many and varied needs to be addressed, and also face many barriers to return to their normal life, including exit homelessness. Providing quality basic services, including availability of counseling services, can play a major role in supporting the affected individuals. In perspective to improve the quality of services in Toronto shelters, the City of Toronto wants to test a New Shelter Services Model (NSSM) program that integrates a peer support approach into shelter-based services for people experiencing homelessness. Based on their own past shelter experience and their pathway to recovery, individuals will be trained and hired to provide counseling services and support in shelters. This peer support service aims at facilitating transition to stable housing and improving the well-being of shelter users.

Based on the partnership agreement between the City of Toronto and MAP Centre for Urban Health Solutions, this study aims to evaluate rigorously the effects of this Peer Support approach on improving housing outcomes and recovery among homeless individuals. Hence, this research will contribute to the elaboration of evaluation design and elaboration, supporting data collection, and rigorous analysis. In addition, it will include particularly a gender-based analysis. We hypothesize that women, men, and non-binary people intersecting with diversity factors will experience peer support differently, and this may lead to different results.

The objective of this research is to determine the association between HIV status and Aboriginal self-identification, MSM behaviour, and sexual scripts within and between Canada and New Zealand using quantitative and qualitative methods. The research hypothesizes that Aboriginal MSM compared to non-indigenous MSM and indigenous non-MSM are at increased risk for HIV, have lower HIV testing patterns and engage in more risk sexual script. 

This research will use both qualitative and quantitative methods and will be conducted through community-based partnership with indigenous groups. As internationally recommended for studying HIV in minority populations, a behavioural and attitudinal survey will be paired with a participant's biological sample, which will be tested for HIV. Statistical analyses will determine associations between HIV status and factors including sexual behavior, drug use and HIV testing. Participants will also be invited to participate in a confidential interview or focus group, which will be used to determine the sexual scripts for indigenous MSM in each country, which can be used to help understand and predict sexual beheaviour.

Understanding the HIV epidemic in these minority groups at increased risk for HIV infection will provide the necessary foundation for community groups and health care providers to effectively develop and deliver culturally-relevant campaigns, programs and services. Ultimately, this research will contribute to battling the HIV epidemic in Canada and in New Zealand."

Social, economic and behavioural factors have been attributed to the higher rates in certain populations. Although First Nations people represent 3.3% of the Canadian people, they have disproportionate rates of HIV infections (6-12% of new infections annually). Although the majority of First Nations people recognize that HIV/AIDS is a serious problem in Canada, the infection rates continue to rise.

The majority of HIV/AIDS cases (58%) and new infections (40%) are seen in Canada's men who have sex with men category. It is estimated that approximately 30% of individuals who are HIV positive are unaware of their status. First Nations people use the term ""two-spirited"" as the label for mixed gender individuals who would otherwise be included in the umbrella term ""queer"". Research on two-spirited individuals is limited and underrepresented, particularly in the health field. It is important to understand differences in perception, attitudes and roles between First Nations and non-First Nations groups particularly with respect to sexual practice and sexual risk.

The proposed exploratory study will investigate issues of HIV/AIDS in two-spirited First Nations populations compared with attitudes and practices in non-First Nations groups. It will comprise both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the sociobehavioural attitudes and activities. Rates of HIV testing, status, condom use and other risky behaviour will be collected and compared in parallel with qualitative thematic analysis pertaining to sexual attitudes and scripts."

Eligible participants were recruited from 2012-2015 using respondent-driven sampling, were aged at least 16 years of age and reported recent sex with another man. Participants completed study visits every 6 months that included a computer-assisted self-interview on demographics, sexual and substance use behaviors, and a nurse-administered clinical questionnaire. A rapid HIV test was administered and a venous blood sample was taken for HCV-antibody serology. We used logistic regression and generalized estimating equations to identify factors associated with prevalent HCV antibodies at enrolment and incident HCV infection at follow-up, respectively. New cases of HCV infection indicate a potential shift to sexual transmission among HIV-positive gay men based on a lack of association with recent injecting behavior. Crystal methamphetamine use remains a strong factor associated with HCV seropositivity and predictor of new infection."
"Crystal Methamphetamine Use Among HIV-Positive and HIV-Negative Men Who Have Sex With Men in Vancouver, Canada: A Longitudinal Analysis","['Lachowsky, Nathan J']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2500.0,364580,"Crystal methamphetamine use is associated with HIV transmission risk. We used prospective bio-behavioural cohort data from men who have sex with men (MSM) to measure trends over time and factors associated with beginning crystal methamphetamine use. Sexually-active MSM aged at least 16 years were recruited using respondent-driven sampling (RDS), and from 02/2012-02/2016 they completed study visits every six months, which included a computer-assisted self-interview and nurse-administered HIV/STI screening. We evaluated trends over time in crystal methamphetamine use and identified predictors of crystal methamphetamine initiation. Over the 4-year study period, 698 MSM completed 3,085 study visits (median follow-up of 2.52 years). Overall, 20.1% of MSM reported recent crystal methamphetamine use, which was significantly higher among HIV-positive (44.3%) than HIV-negative MSM (10.3%). How MSM used crystal methamphetamine did not differ by HIV status: 79.3% reported smoking, 55.0% snorting, 27.9% injecting, and 26.4% hooping. Frequency of use did not differ by HIV status: 43.6% used less than monthly, 20.7% used monthly, and 35.7% used at least weekly. There were no statistically significant trends over time overall or by HIV status. During follow-up, 32 HIV-negative MSM (8.5%) and 14 HIV-positive MSM (15.2%) initiated crystal methamphetamine use. The overall incidence rate was 4.40 per 100 person-years, which did not differ by HIV status. Among initiators, 100% of HIV-positive MSM and 78.1% of HIV-negative MSM self-assessed their risk of transmitting or acquiring HIV as ""low"", respectively. Crystal methamphetamine use was prevalent, stable over time, and initiation was common. Despite crystal methamphetamine initiators reporting greater objective HIV risk, they did not self-perceive this risk. Renewed population-specific interventions and health promotion efforts are desperately needed."

Since 2010, BC has adopted Treatment as Prevention (TasP) as a policy to increase HIV testing and treatment in order to reduce HIV transmission. However, new diagnoses among GBM in BC remain stable with an increase among young GBM. HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a new prevention tool, was approved for use in Canada earlier this year although uptake in BC remains limited. We wish to examine the differential impact of PrEP and TasP on HIV and sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention and transmission among younger (<30 years) versus older (30+ years) GBM in Metro Vancouver with 3 study aims: 1) To measure significant HIV risk behaviour over time that considers use of TasP and PrEP; 2) To determine cumulative STI incidence and the affect of PrEP and TasP; and 3) To understand attitudes about HIV, challenges with HIV prevention and treatment, and changes in sexual negotiation and practices. We will conduct a 3-year mixed method study to collect and triangulate rich data sources. To address Aim 1 and 2, we will enrol 700 GBM (including 250 young GBM) into a prospective bio-behavioural cohort study. Participants will be followed every six months to complete computer assisted self-interview questionnaires and provide biological specimens for HIV and other STI testing. To address Aim 3, we will conduct in-depth qualitative interviews with 50 GBM who were recently diagnosed with HIV, are currently using PrEP, or who report significant HIV risk with no TasP or PrEP use. Situated within the world-renowned BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS, our experienced research team includes public health and service organization leaders. This research will inform population-specific, age-relevant public health policy, programming, and interventions to reduce the burden of HIV and STIs for GBM, especially young GBM."

These inequities impact women's health experiences with increased risk of HIV diagnosis post-migration. In Canada, HIV incidence has remained relatively stable among black females since 2011 with transmission disproportionately high. A majority of these black women are from countries where HIV is endemic and transmission is attributed to heterosexual sex (primarily countries in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean). Despite the continued impact of HIV/AIDS among black women in Canada there has not been much work done in BC to expound their experiences of living with the disease. We propose a sequential exploratory mixed method research study using an intersectionality theoretical framework and community-based research approach. Our collaborative research objectives are: 1) determine how structural factors shape the health and social experiences of the black women living with HIV/AIDS (WLHA) in BC; 2) explore the interplay of gender, race, stigma and migration (status or attitudes) among black WLHA; 3) identify coping mechanisms for HIV-related stigma and discriminations as black WLHA navigate health and social systems. We seek to bring out the historic grassroots community response activities and experiences from the initiation of the community organization (i.e. Afro-Canadian Positive Network of BC) to their present day. We will highlight ways to address black WLHA's health and social challenges by understanding their power relations, social locations and experiences. Results from the study will inform and stimulate up-to-date and effective advocacy and population health policy with an aim to eliminate health and social disparities."

These systems provide fundamental data on progress towards the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets through estimates of undiagnosed infection and measures of the proportion of people living with HIV on sustained treatment and virally suppressed. However, global collaborations on behavioural surveillance have been primary limited by a lack of common indicators and variations in design. The value of harmonizing and comparing data across jurisdictions would allow for an impact evaluation of country-level policy and programmatic response and sufficient statistical power to examine key sub-populations. The goal of this grant is to support the development of the global HIV Behavioural Surveillance for the 21st Century (BS21) Network. The BS21 Network seeks to understand better the HIV research and behavioural surveillance landscape across the world, and to plan future research collaborations and projects to ensure HIV behavioral surveillance remains relevant and impactful in the current era of HIV anti-retroviral prevention. Through this grant, we will: I) organize a two-day in-person meeting of global leaders in HIV behavioural surveillance (researchers and knowledge users) to disseminate research findings and methodological innovations; II) host an official Pre-Congress Symposium at the 2019 STI & AIDS World Congress to officially launch the BS21 Network and to increase capacity and broaden engagement in behavioural surveillance; and III) submit a novel cross-country research operating grant proposal to test innovative HIV bio-behavioural surveillance approaches. Supporting the global BS21 Network will help promote robust, sustainable, and cost-effective data collection methods as well as stimulate new innovations in domestic and global behavioural surveillance."

Oral history offers a way of addressing persistent health challenges, not just by preserving the past, but by providing insight into how current prevention and treatment interventions can be reinvigorated. This proposal aims to build on an ongoing CIHR Catalyst Grant-funded project collecting oral history of the early years of British Columbia's HIV/AIDS epidemic, with the end goal of sharing our findings with diverse community audiences. Thus far, we have conducted over 110 interviews with a diverse group of long-term survivors and caregivers across British Columbia. This knowledge translation and exchange with affected communities will help to preserve cultural memory of the early AIDS epidemic, promote much-needed cross-generational and cross-sector dialogue in the present, and contribute a more nuanced temporal lens to future health research, promotion, and care. If secured, funding would be used to produce community-oriented dissemination events, programming, and tools to maximize the impacts of our oral histories on key stakeholders in the community and health sector. Specifically, we will: 1) Hold two community forums in Vancouver and Victoria to share the main results of our research with affected communities. 2) Generate intergenerational community dialogue by integrating our findings within existing programming run by our community-based partners at YouthCO and the Community-Based Research Centre. 3) Adapt our archival collection into a multi-media exhibit (including interview clips and quotations, and archival materials) and present it in Vancouver, Victoria, and elsewhere. And 4) Produce at least one community-oriented, arts-based output from the project, likely a short film, to share our findings with a wider audience."

These infections can have severe consequences for patients and treatment can be both time consuming and costly for Canada's healthcare system. Stemming the tide of increasing STIs is a federal priority and one new prevention tool is doxycycline medication (""doxy""). Doxy can be taken before or immediately after STI exposure and has recently been made available in Canada at no cost to gay, bisexual, and queer men (GBQM) who participate in group sex. Using doxy may be especially useful for preventing STIs in this context given that having group sex is common (as many as 1 in 4 GBQM in a recent Vancouver study) and STIs can be transmit in unique ways (e.g., if someone does not change condoms between partners). The aims of this project are to 1) understand how many GBQM who have group sex are currently using doxy, 2) whether doxy is helping to prevent STIs among these QBQM, and 3) learn how specifically GBQM are using doxy at group sex events. Our multidisciplinary team will address our first two aims through a questionnaire linked to bacterial STI test results. We will analyze how many GBQM in Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal with group sex experience are using doxy, and whether this predicts fewer STI diagnoses. To address our third aim, we will conduct follow up interviews with 10 participants from each city (30 interviews total) to learn more about how doxy is (or is not) incorporated into group sex events. To develop our questions, we will work closely with a community advisory board of local GBQM in each city. Based on our results, we will create resources for GBQM who have group sex, for healthcare clinicians and workers serving GBQM, and for healthcare policy makers. We expect these resources to reduce bacterial STI transmission through better equipping healthcare providers and helping GBQM who have group sex make informed choices about doxy."
Food security from the perspective of Nunavimmiut,"['Laflamme, Lea']",['N/A'],"[""Bourses De Voyage D'Aci""]",995.0,288370,"Bourses de voyage d'ACI 

Few qualitative studies on the experience and understanding of food security have been conduct with Inuit in Canada. This limit the ability to develop interventions and measurement that fully take into account the socio-cultural and economic context of Inuit communities. In this exploratory research, individual qualitative interviews with nineteen Inuit women from different generations, occupations and socio-economic status of one community in Nunavik (Quebec) led to a better understanding of food sufficiency, food insecurity experience, as well as coping strategies and community resources to maintain a satisfactory food situation. Additionally, a workshop with elders explored different sensations of food as they are described in Inuktitut. This workshop allow for a deepening of the cultural concepts surrounding the experience of eating and food security. Community participation was ensured by consulting key individuals in the community from cultural, health and wellness sectors throughout the research process. In short, the results suggest that the notion of what constitutes ""sufficient food"" is built from individual experiences and socio-cultural context, and tends to vary across generations. Many of the participants interviewed experienced food shortage in the recent past. However, resources within extended family and community tend to alleviate the situation when it was transitory.  Food sharing networks are an important feature of food security in the community studied. Participants identified possible food security solutions at the community and regional level. Finally, results and overall research process led to some reflections on the measurement of food security as well as methodological considerations for future research."

In British Columbia, opioid overdose has been declared a public health emergency; the problem is particularly pronounced among Vancouver's Downtown Eastside (DTES) neighbourhood, home to a large population of people who use illicit drugs (PWUD). In an effort to tackle this emerging public health challenge, experts across North America have called for innovative prevention and response strategies. Meanwhile, in light of the imminent legalization of cannabis in Canada, there is a push to understand how increased cannabis access and use will influence a range of public health outcomes. Compelling evidence from research of medical cannabis legalization in the United States suggests that cannabis legalization may help reduce opioid use and related morbidity and mortality, possibly through increased use of cannabis over opioids to treat chronic non-cancer pain conditions and/or substitute higher risk drug use, including opioid use. Among illicit drug using populations, the relationship between increasing cannabis use and opioid-related health outcomes has not been fully explored. Using health data from two long-running studies of over 2000 PWUD recruited from Vancouver's DTES, this work will examine relationships between access to/use of cannabis, use of opioids (including prescription opioids), health service utilization, and drug-related morbidity (e.g., overdose and injury). It is hypothesized that increased access to and use of cannabis will be associated with subsequent reduced opioid use, and consequently reduced opioid-related overdose and drug-related injury. Findings from this work will help shape adaptations and evaluations of the framework for cannabis legalization in Canada, and inform clinical guidelines and practices related to opioid and cannabis prescribing among drug using populations."

Dépossédés de leurs rôles de pourvoyeurs, de protecteurs et de pères, les hommes autochtones sont à toute fin pratique oubliés. Les enfants autochtones, quant à eux, sont surreprésentés à travers les services de protection du Canada. Malgré les risques accrus de mortalité, de morbidité et de problèmes psychosociaux encourues par les enfants autochtones, l'information portant sur la paternité en milieu autochtone est presqu'inexistante. Les pères représentent une ressource précieuse, mais non-exploitée pour soutenir la santé physique et mentale de leur progéniture. Devant les taux alarmants de morbidité et de placement sous la LPJ des enfants autochtones et le manque flagrant d'information sur la paternité en milieu autochtone, il est primordial d'augmenter les connaissances sur l'engagement paternel afin de soutenir les hommes et d'améliorer les indicateurs de santé des enfants. Ainsi, ce projet de planification vise à développer une recherche participative basé sur la communauté portant sur le thème de la paternité autochtone avec les partenaires du milieu. Les objectifs spécifiques sont de 1-documenter les besoins en information exprimés par les intervenants, qui pourraient favoriser la mise en place d'actions efficaces de soutien à l'engagement paternel; 2-donner la parole à des pères autochtones de façon à documenter leurs besoins; 3-mettre en lien les intervenants du milieu autochtone avec ceux du Regroupement pour la Valorisation de la Paternité (RVP) afin que la thématique des pères autochtones y soit considérée et intégrée; et 4-synthétiser de façon préliminaire la littérature et recenser les programmes visant à soutenir l'engagement paternel en milieu autochtone."
Cuystwi: Indigenous Youth Wellness - Assessing the impact of an online upstream suicide prevention program,"['Laliberte, Nancy J']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal Youth Suicide Prevention', 'Community Based Participatory Research', 'Health Promotion', 'Indigenous Methodologies']",108000.0,317897,"In Canada, rates of suicide among Indigenous youth remain higher than non-Indigenous youth. In BC, the Transformative Change Accord: First Nations Health Plan identifies establishing mental health programs to address substance use and youth suicide as a priority action area in health.  Studies have found maintaining cultural continuity is fundamental to the prevention of youth suicide in Indigenous communities. There is emerging research to support cultural connectedness as preventative of suicide risk. The Cuystwi: Indigenous Youth Wellness project emerged from conversations with Indigenous communities expressing their frustration at a lack of culturally relevant community based programs to prevent youth suicide. The Cuystwi project is an online training set out in modules of activity and video based interactive learning. The modules address the importance of culture, the history of colonization from an Indigenous perspective, tools to deal with racism and healthy relationships. The training is a paired with existing community youth programming. I propose to test the feasibility, acceptability and knowledge uptake of the training with the youth and facilitators involved in Cuystwi using a combination of appropriate epidemiological, Indigenous and evaluation methods. This will be accomplished by co-creating wellness indicators with Indigenous communities participating in the project to assess the impact of the training on youth and facilitators. The hope is that Cuystwi will be an effective, acceptable and relevant program for Indigenous communities to improve well-being in youth. This research has the potential to add to upstream health promotion programming for Indigenous youth in BC using cost-effective online resources combined with community programming."

Symptoms of psychosis (hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thoughts) typically emerge during the critical developmental period of adolescence and young adulthood. The onset of psychosis during this stage of life can seriously derail transitions to higher education/vocational training, employment, marriage and parenthood. Little is known about how a young person develops resilience (the capacity to cope) when faced with the challenging circumstances associated with an early onset of psychosis. This project will explore the experiences of resilience and adversity from the perspective of youth recently diagnosed with psychotic illness and from the perspective of their supportive networks such as family caregivers and service providers. In particular, the study aims to identify aspects of the environment that shape the development of resilience when a young person is diagnosed with psychosis. Hence, specific topics that will be investigated include: the role of the social, cultural, geographical and economic environment (micro and macro levels) in supporting and hindering resilience. The results from this project will broaden our understanding of resilience and will inform the development of guidelines and tools to assess important aspects of resilience not captured by currently available coping and resilience measures. The results will also be used to develop and test psychological and social interventions targeted at building the capacity to cope in youth recently diagnosed with psychosis. Ultimately, this work will contribute to improving treatment options and care for youth and prevent long term disabilities associated with chronic diseases such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression."

This inclusive approach has been widely recognized in clinical research for increasing understanding of patient priorities and aligning research with patient perspectives. However, our previous work has revealed a gap in engaging patients in preclinical research, which involves laboratory investigations with cells and animals (Fox et al., eBiomedicine 2021).

To address this critical gap, we propose a novel approach where patient partners and researchers are brought together to identify research questions suitable for preclinical research on sepsis (i.e., life-threatening infections that require intensive care). Our approach involves a daylong meeting, along with pre- and post-meeting activities, during which research priorities will be identified for investigation in preclinical sepsis research. 

During the meeting, patient partners, researchers, trainees, and knowledge users will participate in facilitated discussions on sepsis and preclinical models. These discussions will lead to a priority-setting exercise that identifies a preclinical sepsis research question of interest to be studied in a future preclinical systematic review, and then in a lab model of sepsis.

This meeting will be the first step toward patient engagement in preclinical sepsis research. By actively involving patient partners as co-investigators, our initiative will pave the way for advancements in patient engagement across preclinical research. This includes integrating patient perspectives in priority setting and exploring avenues for patient involvement at the earliest stages of research. Our meeting and approach will serve as a model for other preclinical researchers to follow."

Exploring How Young Women From Low-Income Neighbourhoods Perceive Their Emotional Health,"['Lapalme, Josée']",['N/A'],"['Emotional Health', 'Grounded Theory Approach', 'Low-Income Neighbourhoods', 'Photovoice Technique', 'Qualitative Methodology', ""Young Women'S Health""]",17500.0,200079,"Many studies show that neighbourhoods have an important impact on young adults' emotional health. These studies found that low-income neighbourhoods often act as barriers to achieving and maintaining an optimal emotional health due to various neighbourhood-level factors. Furthermore, young women are often more sensitive to these neighbourhood effects than young men. This sensitivity elevates their risk to experience more severe emotional health problems than their young male counterparts. However, there exists a gap in the literature regarding how young women from low-income neighbourhoods perceive their emotional health. Therefore, using qualitative methods, this study will explore how young women (ages 14 to 18) from a low-income neighbourhood in Halifax, Nova Scotia perceive their emotional health. It will also seek to explore what these young women perceive to be the key neighbourhood-level determinants influencing their emotional health and what they believe is needed in their neighbourhood to improve their emotional health. In-depth semi-structured interviews and photovoice technique (i.e. photos taken by participants) will be employed to collect the data. The findings of this study will better shape health promotion related policies and programs to better suit the specific needs of this vulnerable population in the hopes of creating emotionally healthier young women."
How stakeholders' perceive the effects of future Scottish tobacco control on smoking inequalities,"['Lapalme, Josée']",['N/A'],"['Cancer Prevention', 'Ics Travel Award', 'Smoking Inequalities', 'Tobacco Control Policies']",1000.0,368407,"Background. Despite significant declines in smoking prevalence in Scotland, 34% of people living in the most deprived areas smoked in 2014, compared to 9% of those living in the least deprived areas. Few studies have examined tobacco control's effects on smoking inequalities and their findings are inconsistent. Some studies found that certain tobacco control policies have had the unforeseen effect of increasing social exclusion and stigmatization among deprived smokers. This issue is challenging for the Scottish government, which aims to design policies to reduce smoking prevalence and smoking inequalities. To better understand how tobacco control affects inequalities, we sought the perspectives of those involved in its design. We asked: How do tobacco control stakeholders perceive future Scottish tobacco control policies as affecting smoking inequalities? Methods. We conducted a qualitative thematic document analysis of 92 Scottish government consultations completed by tobacco control stakeholders in 2014. We analysed 12 questions that addressed future tobacco control (i.e. smoke-free NHS grounds and children's outdoor areas) and their effects on inequalities. Results. Many stakeholders agreed that further de-normalised smoking with national smoke-free policies was key to reducing smoking inequalities. A few stakeholders were concerned of the stigmatizing and exclusionary effects of smoke-free policies on deprived groups. They suggested that community groups be involved in future policy design to reduce inequalities. Conclusions. Scarce research examines tobacco control stakeholders' perspectives although they are critical in policy design. Results suggest that their perceptions of the effects of tobacco control on smoking inequalities vary, with many failing to consider tobacco control's potential effects on increases in inequalities. Researchers and stakeholders need to consider how smoking inequalities are perceived to design future equitable tobacco control."
Social inequalities in smoking across Montreal neighbourhoods: Understanding young adults' experiences of neighbourhood smoking-related norms and practices,"['Lapalme, Josée']",['N/A'],"['Focus Groups', 'Health Equity', 'Health Promotion', 'Neighbourhoods', 'Population Health', 'Qualitative Research', 'Smoking', 'Social Inequalities', 'Young Adults']",1169.0,364667,"Although smoking prevalence has significantly decreased, it remains highest among individuals of low socio-economic status and young adults (YA). A relationship between social inequalities in smoking and neighbourhood-level deprivation has also been found with higher smoking prevalence reported in high deprivation neighbourhoods. What remains unclear is the relationship between neighbourhood-level deprivation and smoking in YA. We sought to examine YAs' experience of smoking in relation to the deprivation level of their neighbourhood to better understand social inequalities in smoking. This qualitative descriptive study was undertaken in the context of the Interdisciplinary Study of Inequalities in Smoking, which examines the relationship between neighbourhood deprivation and social inequalities in smoking among YA in Montreal. We used secondary data collected through nine focus groups with YA (4 men, 5 women; 18-25 years old) residing in four Montreal neighbourhoods (2 high, 2 low deprivation). We used the collective lifestyles framework to guide thematic analysis and explore within and between neighbourhood social norms and practices. Each neighbourhood had unique local smoking-related social norms and practices. Yet, we observed similarities by neighbourhood-level deprivation. Permissive smoking-related social norms in high-deprivation neighbourhoods made it difficult to avoid smoking and/or quit. Conversely, strict anti-smoking norms within low-level deprivation neighbourhoods resulted in smoking in secret and/or only amidst 'acceptable' social settings. Smoking-related social norms and practices among YA seem to vary according to neighbourhood-level deprivation. Findings reveal the possible influence of neighbourhoods in reproducing social inequalities in smoking among YA. They also allow us to advocate for policies and interventions that consider the impact that norms and practices in neighbourhoods can have on social inequalities in YA smoking."

The federal governments response or intervention to the housing crisis in the north was to provide funding to communities who qualify and apply to programs through Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation under Canada's Economic Action Plan. In Manitoba over 30 million dollars flowed through Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation for new constructions on reserve between 2009 to 2011. Now in 2012, one year after this program ended there still is a crisis where inadequate housing seriously burdens the physical, social, spiritual and emotional health of northern FNs. The two Manitoba Dene communities, Northlands Denesuline First Nation and Sayisi Dene First Nation, identified a lack of vision for housing that integrates their cultural and social values, and practical needs with existing housing policies and programs. The communities are prepared to evaluate the impact and relevance of the Canada's Economic Action Plan program for their community and explore how on-reserve housing stock can meet the need to be sustainable, culturally relevant, safe, and function within the Dene traditional lifestyle. The community lead project will tap into the creative energies of the youth to develop a vision to discover, envision and create culturally relevant housing and change policies to better reflect Dene values.

The United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition (2016-2025) commitment has built momentum to foster timely collaborations among relevant stakeholders, including governments, health system and community organizations, and academia. The Nutrition Decade promotes effective actions aiming to eradicate hunger and all forms of malnutrition, while recognizing and mitigating potential negative environmental impacts of food and health systems.

To support research on national and international spread and scale in line with the Nutrition Decade, a collaboration between the Office of Spread and Scale at Women's College Hospital, and the UK Need for Nutrition Education/Innovation Programme (NNEdPro) Global Centre for Nutrition and Health has been formed. This collaboration will support research on implementation science, spread, and scale at the intersection of food, health, education, and environment, in line with Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of zero hunger, good health and wellbeing, reducing inequities, and responsible consumption and production. 

Following a standardized process, this work will:

1)Identify a 'Top 10' list of high-priority, feasible, and equity-informed research questions that align with the 4 identified SDGs, focusing on spread and scale at the intersection of food, health, education, and environment in Canada.

2)Seek input from international experts about the barriers, facilitators, and opportunities for collaboration related to the research questions. 

3)Develop a collaborative grant application for CIHR IPPH based on the Top 10 list, informed by national and international consultations. 

Overall, the aim is to identify research questions and develop a plan to submit a collaborative IPPH application on spread and scale at the intersection of food, health, education, and environment."
"Exposition cumulée aux stresseurs psychosociaux, marqueurs inflammatoires, télomères et fonction cognitive : Une étude prospective de 20 ans","['Laurin, Danielle', 'Brisson, Chantal']","['Dionne, Clermont', 'Diorio, Caroline', 'Giguere, Yves', 'Mâsse, Benoît R', 'Maunsell, Elizabeth', 'Milot, Alain', 'Ndjaboue, Ruth', 'Vezina, Michel']","['Contraintes Psychosociales', 'Crp', 'Fonction Cognitive', 'Il-6', ""Marqueur D'Oxydation"", 'Marqueur Inflammatoire', 'Modèle Demande-Latitude', 'Modèle Efforts-Reconnaissance', 'Télomères', 'Épidémiologie']",781921.0,305117,"Des études rapportent que l'exposition au stress chronique au travail (contraintes psychosociales) contribue au développement de problèmes de la mémoire (fonction cognitive) avec l'âge. L'inflammation et l'oxydation sont deux mécanismes d'action impliqués dans le vieillissement. Des marqueurs d'inflammation et d'oxydation sont mesurables dans le sang. Des travaux ont observé que certains marqueurs inflammatoires seraient associés à des problèmes affectant la fonction cognitive. D'autres suggèrent que les contraintes psychosociales au travail seraient associées à des marqueurs d'inflammation. Les télomères sont des marqueurs d'oxydation et d'inflammation dans le sang. Les télomères constituent la partie terminale protectrice des chromosomes, et leur raccourcissement a été associé au stress psychosocial et au vieillissement cellulaire. Il est donc raisonnable de penser que les marqueurs inflammatoires et les télomères pourraient être impliqués dans la relation entre les contraintes psychosociales au travail et la fonction cognitive. Notre étude vise à évaluer l'effet d'une exposition chronique aux contraintes psychosociales au travail sur les concentrations sanguines de trois marqueurs, deux inflammatoires (CRP et IL-6), et un davantage oxydatif (la longueur des télomères) et la fonction cognitive. Ce projet sera mené auprès d'environ 4500 personnes recrutées en 1991-93 pour une étude sur les contraintes psychosociales au travail. Les données sur les marqueurs inflammatoires, les télomères et la fonction cognitive seront recueillies en 2015-18. Les contraintes psychosociales au travail sont considérées comme une priorité dans les politiques de prévention en santé puisqu'elles touchent une proportion importante de travailleurs (20%) et qu'elles peuvent être améliorées. Notre étude pourra contribuer à identifier des facteurs menant à des problèmes de fonction cognitive plus sévère comme la maladie d'Alzheimer, permettant ainsi d'agir en prévention de cette maladie."
"Association entre la vitamine D, le déclin cognitif et la démence chez l'aîné: Données de l'Étude sur la santé et le vieillissement au Canada","['Laurin, Danielle']","['Dodin, Sylvie', 'Giguere, Yves', 'Tourigny, André']","['Déclin Cognitif', 'Démence', ""Maladie D'Alzheimer"", 'Marqueurs Biologiques', 'Vitamine D Plasmatique', 'Épidémiologie']",99988.0,292015,"Le vieillissement de la population âgée représente un véritable défi pour la société canadienne. Malgré une hausse de l'espérance de vie, l'avancement en âge s'accompagne le plus souvent de la manifestation de maladies physiques et mentales dont la maladie d'Alzheimer. Des concentrations faibles de vitamine D dans le sang sont fréquentes chez les personnes âgées, de par leur consommation limitée en lait et produits laitiers enrichis en vitamine D et d'un manque d'exposition au soleil. Bien que l'on sache que la vitamine D est importante pour les os, de nouvelles études suggèrent qu'un manque de vitamine D dans le sang pourrait aussi contribuer au développement de problèmes de mémoire menant jusqu'à la maladie d'Alzheimer. Il existe peu d'études cependant qui ont évalué avec rigueur ce lien chez la personne âgée. Ce projet de recherche vise à déterminer le rôle de la vitamine D, telle que mesurée dans le sang, dans le développement de problèmes de mémoire légers à sévères comme ceux retrouvés dans la maladie d'Alzheimer. Cette étude sera réalisée à partir des données et des échantillons de sang recueillis dans le cadre d'une importante étude effectuée au Canada sur une période de 10 ans chez des personnes âgées de 65 ans et plus. Nous vérifierons auprès de plus de 700 participants à cette étude, si le fait d'avoir de faibles concentrations sanguines de vitamine D est associé à un risque plus élevé de présenter des problèmes de mémoire ou de développer une maladie d'Alzheimer dans le temps. Si une faible concentration de vitamine D semblait associée à un développement plus marqué de problèmes de mémoire, il serait utile de suggérer aux professionnels de la santé de vérifier plus fréquemment les niveaux sanguins de vitamine D pour s'assurer d'un niveau adéquat, quitte à recommander des changements dans l'alimentation ou la prise de suppléments de vitamine D."
Cultural adaptation of health and social interventions: a literature review of existing models,"['Lauzière, Julie']",['N/A'],"['Cultural Adaptation Model', 'Knowledge Systhesis']",1500.0,418162,"Introduction:
Significant gaps exist in the quality of health and healthcare across population groups in Canada and worldwide, with Indigenous and ethnocultural communities being particularly impacted. Cultural adaptation of programs or interventions is one way to take culture into consideration in the service provision in order to improve access to and outcomes of the health and social programs offered to improve their situation. This presentation aims to document the variety of models or frameworks that have been proposed for culturally adapting health and social programs intended for diverse populations.

Methods:
A systematic search was performed using 3 databases (CINAHL, Medline, and PsycInfo) to identify the academic literature on cultural adaptation models for interventions or programs. Documents were included if they were published between 2009 and 2019 either in English or French. Reference list of the included publications were also screened for additional documents.

Findings:
Over 20 models or frameworks found in the literature. Most of them were developed and used in the United States to adapt programs intended for Latinos and/or African Americans. Three frameworks were developed in the context of programs for indigenous populations. The models or frameworks help to answer the question 'What to adapt' (content-oriented) and/or 'How to adapt' (process-oriented). Their main limitations are that they focus almost exclusively on the program itself or its immediate context, and they rarely acknowledge organizational and community-level factors.

Conclusions and implications:
Existing cultural adaptation models and frameworks can assist program developers and implementers in making decisions about what and how to adapt their health and social interventions for diverse populations. Further research is needed to explore the way broader factors  such as economic, social, policy, and organizational factors could be considered in such models."
Inégalités sociales dans les trajectoires d'usage des traitements oraux pour le cancer du sein : Une comparaison France - Québec,"['Lauzier, Sophie']","['Nabi, Hermann', 'Talbot, Denis']","['Accès Aux Traitements', 'Bases De Données Administratives', 'Cancer Du Sein', 'Facteurs Socioécononomiques', 'Hormonothérapie Adjuvante', 'Inégalités Sociales De Santé', 'Traitements Oraux', 'Usage Des Médicaments']",74738.0,377890,"L'utilisation de traitements anticancéreux oraux a considérablement augmenté au cours des dernières décennies. Ces traitements représentent un défi pour l'adhésion puisque les patients doivent gérer leur médication de façon autonome. L'hormonothérapie adjuvante (HA) pour le cancer du sein a été l'un des premiers traitements oraux prescrits en oncologie et est l'un des plus utilisés. Selon les recommandations, les femmes ayant un cancer du sein hormonodépendant doivent prendre l'HA quotidiennement sur une période d'au moins cinq ans comme mesure préventive des récidives. Malgré les bénéfices de l'HA, l'adhésion au traitement est sous-optimale pour une proportion importante de femmes. Bien que les facteurs socioéconomiques soient susceptibles d'influencer l'adhésion à ce traitement, leur impact sur les trajectoires d'usage de l'HA pour les cinq années de traitement n'a pas été étudié. L'objectif de cette étude est d'évaluer l'association entre des indicateurs socioéconomiques et les trajectoires d'usage de l'HA chez les femmes atteintes d'un cancer du sein. Pour réaliser cette étude, nous utiliserons deux sources de données accessibles à la communauté scientifique: la base de données de l'enquête nationale française la Vie deux ans après le cancer (VICAN2) et les bases de données administratives de la Régie de l'assurance-maladie du Québec (RAMQ). La réduction des inégalités de morbidité et de mortalité par cancer constitue un objectif prioritaire pour plusieurs organisations au Canada et en France. Les résultats de cette étude permettront de documenter la présence d'inégalités sociales dans l'usage de ce traitement dans le contexte de régimes d'assurance-médicament publics. Les résultats pourront être utilisés pour guider le développement d'études visant à approfondir notre compréhension de la genèse et de la persistance des inégalités sociales de santé dans cette population et pour orienter le développement d'interventions susceptibles de les réduire."
