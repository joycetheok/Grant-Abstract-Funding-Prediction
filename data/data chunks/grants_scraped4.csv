Teaching empowerment: Grass-roots educators' strategies to address gender equity in the context of the HIV epidemic in South Africa,"['Gacoin, Andree E']",['N/A'],"['Curriculum', 'Education', 'Ethnography', 'Gender Equity', 'Health Promotion', 'South Africa', 'Youth']",150000.0,218055,"A key issue in HIV prevention education is addressing the unequal gender power relations (relations between men and women within a particular society) that make many young women more vulnerable to HIV infection. For example, it can be difficult for young women to negotiate condom use with their partner.  The importance of teaching gender equity is particularly evident in South Africa, where the HIV prevalence in young women aged 20 to 29 is double that of young men in the same age group.  There is however a significant gap in our understanding of how HIV prevention curricula are taught, and how messages related to gender equity are communicated and understood in the everyday context of people's lives.  My research, which builds on my professional experience working in South Africa, aims to deepen our understanding of how gender equity is taught, understood and taken-up at a community level.  I will conduct a year-long ethnographic study with a South African non-profit organization that develops youth peer education training curricula.  The program provides a unique opportunity to explore how adult educators interpret and implement messages as they train peer educators (youth ages 14 to 16 who engage in educational activities with their peers in secondary school settings), as well as how peer educators take-up these messages as they engage with their peers. This research will contribute to our understanding of how we can bring together local and global leadership to promote more equitable gender relations through health education, in this instance to empower young women and young men to protect themselves from a life threatening disease. Furthermore, the research aims to be more broadly applicable to the field of sex education, and will offer Canadian educators a unique opportunity to learn from strategies that promote gender equity and apply these strategies to their own work with Canadian youth."
"Investigating the relationships between residential stability, physical and mental health, and quality of life in homeless and vulnerably housed individuals: A longitudinal multi-site cohort study in Canada","['Gadermann, Anne M']",['N/A'],"['Determinants Of Health And Quality Of Life Of Homeless', 'Housing And Homelessness', 'Latent Class Growth Modeling', 'Longitudinal Analysis', 'Population Health', 'Psychometrics', 'Vulnerable Populations']",90000.0,269839,"Housing is a basic human need and a significant socio-economic determinant of population health. In Canada, an increasingly large number of individuals are facing homelessness and inadequate housing, with tens of thousands of people being homeless on any given night. Homelessness and inadequate housing have considerable negative impact on individuals' physical and mental health as well as their quality of life. In order to elucidate factors that affect residential (in)stability, and the interactions between inadequate housing, health, and quality of life, longitudinal research is needed. This project draws upon Canada's first longitudinal multi-site cohort study of homeless and vulnerably housed individuals (HVHIs). In this study, 1,200 HVHIs are interviewed annually over a 5-year period in Ottawa, Toronto, and Vancouver. The interview surveys assess demographic characteristics, residential trajectory, physical and mental health diagnoses, quality of life, psychological distress, family history, social support, risk behaviours, service utilization, contact with the legal system, and life events. These data are being linked to participants' health insurance databases providing information on their health care utilization. Complex statistical methods will be employed to examine the relationships between housing, health, and quality of life among the HVHIs over time; the combination of individual, contextual, and health factors that predict residential (in)stability; and how the health status, psychological distress, social support, risk behaviours, quality of life, and use of health care services change during or after periods of residential stability. 
This research is critical for understanding the relationships between inadequate housing, health and quality of life, and for creating research knowledge that can be used to inform programs and policy decisions for improving the health and quality of life of Canadians who are homeless or vulnerably housed."

Mental health trajectories of immigrant and refugee children from early childhood to adolescence: An ecological population- based approach,"['Gadermann, Anne M', 'Georgiades, Katholiki K', 'Guhn, Martin', 'Janus, Magdalena']","['Gagn√© Petteni, Monique H', 'Puyat, Joseph H', 'Richardson, Chris G', 'Ungar, Michael']","['Child And Youth Development', 'Developmental Trajectories', 'Immigrant And Refugee', 'Longitudinal Data Analyses', 'Mental Health', 'Population Health', 'Social Determinants']",218026.0,381972,"Canada's immigrant and refugee population is growing rapidly, representing approximately 20% of the Canadian population. Despite the demographic significance, there is limited representative information on the mental health of this population. One significant challenge for the field concerns the absence of a cogent understanding of the ways in which individual, family, cultural, school, and neighbourhood factors are jointly associated with the mental health trajectories of immigrant and refugee children and youth from kindergarten through grade 12.
This research project aims to address this gap. Our team has built a large, representative database, which follows children from kindergarten to grade 12, and captures mental health information as well as a number of factors that may be associated with mental health, including (i) migration factors (country of origin; immigration categories; age of arrival; generational status), (ii) social and socioeconomic family factors (connectedness to adults at home, maternal psychopathology, socio-economic status (SES)), and (iii) social, socio-demographic, and ethno-cultural characteristics of the receiving communities (connectedness to peers and adults at school, neighbourhood SES, and proportion of own-group immigrants in the neighbourhood). Using this database, and applying an ecological framework, we will examine the ways in which migration-related characteristics, contextual variables, and social processes are jointly related to immigrant and refugee child and youth mental health outcomes over time. This will allow us to identify actionable protective and risk factors to enhance immigrant/refugee child and youth mental health, thus providing important insights for prevention and intervention strategies."
The Social Exposome in Child Health and Development: Building Partnerships and Collaborations to Reduce Inequalities in Canada,"['Gadermann, Anne M', 'Kobor, Michael S']","['Guhn, Martin', 'Henderson, Sarah', 'Van Jaarsveld, Danielle', 'DeLongis, Anita', 'Janus, Magdalena', 'McGrail, Kimberlyn M', 'Turvey, Stuart E']","['Child Development', 'Child Health', 'Environmental Health', 'Epigenetics', 'Exposome', 'Inequalities', 'Population Health', 'Social Determinants Of Health']",10000.0,404393,"Despite being the 5th most prosperous country in the world, when compared to other developed countries, Canada's rankings are alarmingly low on key measures of children's health and safety, as well as child poverty (17% of all children). These conditions have resulted in large and growing inequalities in the development and health of Canadian children. For example, using standard measures, children from low income neighbourhoods are more vulnerable on key areas of development than those from high income neighbourhoods. In addition, children with chronic diseases, like asthma, who are from low income neighbourhoods or families are admitted to the hospital more frequently. This impact of living conditions on health and well-being is referred to as the social determinants of health, and when experienced during development, has life-long implications for the risk of developing chronic diseases and mental illnesses. It is crucial that we understand the specific factors leading to these inequalities in order to devise policies and interventions to reduce them. 

We are proposing to host a workshop that will bring together researchers, health care practitioners, experts in policy, and relevant community and government groups to understand the social and environmental factors that lead to these disparities, the biological processes in the body by which they do so, and to explore potential policies and interventions to reduce them. We anticipate this leading to new collaborations and partnerships and identifying the next steps required to optimize child health and development for all children in Canada."
Understanding Pandemic Preparedness in the Context of the Canadian Homelessness Crisis,"['Gaetz, Stephen A']","['Ali, Syed H', 'Graham, John R', 'Hurtubise, Roch', 'Hwang, Stephen W', 'Keil, Roger', 'Mosher, Janet E', 'Pauly, Bernadette M', 'Waegemakers Schiff, Jeannette', 'Wu, Jianhong']","['Health Care', 'Homelessness', 'Pandemic Planning', 'Public Health']",100000.0,183452,"As homelessness in Canada continues, it is essential to ask what impact an influenza pandemic might have on the homeless population and urban communities across the country.   More than 250,000 individuals use homeless shelters annually across Canada. In the event of a pandemic, it is not clear whether the infrastructures to address homelessness, public health or the health care system in general will be prepared to adequately respond to the risks faced by the homeless population.  
      We will address key challenges to effective pandemic preparedness in the context of the homelessness crisis in by assembling a multidisciplinary, pan-Canadian team of top homelessness researchers and community-based organizations in  Victoria, Calgary, Montreal and Toronto.  In each city, a team will investigate the potential risk factors and impacts of an influenza pandemic on the homeless population and the infrastructure that is in place to provide emergency services to this group.  This will be done by gathering baseline information on the local homeless population; assessing pandemic plans at municipal, provincial and agency levels; and analyzing and profiling homeless services infrastructures.  
     This analysis will help Canadians in all parts of the country, in all levels of government, and within a broad range of communities to better prepare for, and respond to an influenza pandemic."
Self-stigma: a barrier to rehabilitation among older adults with sensory impairment,"['Gagne, Jean-Pierre']","['Getty, Louise', 'Given, Lisa M', 'Jennings, Mary Beth', 'Jutai, Jeffrey W', 'Lagac√©, Martine', 'Overbury, Olga', 'Strong, Graham G']","['Anti-Stigma Treament Program', 'Mixed Qualitative And Quantitative Research', 'Psychosocial Consequences Of Sensory Impairment', 'Self-Stigma', 'Sensory Impairments', 'Treatment Efficacy Research']",5000.0,185654,"In North America there is a stigma attached to older adults who have hearing and/or vision impairments. Individuals who have these chronic impairments are perceived to be senile, less able and socially inept. Traditionally, stigma research focused on describing the perceptions and behaviours of ""the outsiders""; that is, those individuals who do not possess a stigmatizing trait. Recently however, stigma has been investigated from the perspective of ""the insiders""; or those individuals who possess a stigmatizing trait. Self-stigma is a condition whereby a person holds a devalued perception of himself/herself (""a perceived identity threat"") due to the fact that they have a stigmatizing trait. Self-stigma often leads to shame and lower self-esteem. In some domains of health, such as mental illness, as well as in the case of sensory impairments it has been shown that self-stigma can act as an obstacle to rehabilitation. In order to avoid or minimize being identified as a member of a stigmatized group, individuals with a given health condition may choose not to seek health services or fail to comply with the recommended treatments. There is ample evidence that many older adults who have hearing and/or vision impairments and are eligible for rehabilitation services choose not to access them. We hypothesize that an important part of this avoidance attitude towards treatment is attributable to self-stigma. We propose a research program that will investigate several aspects of self-stigma associated with sensory impairments. Moreover, as in other domains of health, we will develop a self-stigma treatment program for the targeted population. If our self-stigma treatment program is efficacious, older adults with sensory impairment will display: a decrease in self-stigma; an increase in access to rehabilitation services (including the use of assistive technology); and an improvement in their overall health condition, autonomy, and quality of life."
Challenging the study of health inequalities during young adulthood: smoking in the Canadian National Population Health Survey as a case example,"['Gagn√©, Thierry']",['N/A'],"['Cancer', 'Ics Travel Awards', 'Longitudinal', 'Smoking', 'Social Inequalities', 'Young Adulthood']",1000.0,382799,"Background. Understanding the development of health inequalities during young adulthood requires consideration of the dynamic and age-graded nature of socioeconomic circumstances during this life period. To illustrate this, we examine changes in social inequalities in smoking between the ages of 18 and 25.

Methods. 1,243 young adults were followed every two years in the Canadian National Population Health Survey. Using GEE models, we regressed smoking on education, living arrangements, and relationship, employment, and student status. We examined main effects and interactions by education and age. 

Results. Post-secondary education was associated with a lower risk of smoking while atypical living arrangements, not studying, and being single were associated with a higher risk of smoking. These associations, however, significantly varied with age. The positive influence of having post-secondary education on the risk of smoking was absent at ages 18-19 and became strong at ages 24-25. On the other hand, the negative influence of living with children on the risk of smoking was very strong at ages 18-19 but disappeared by ages 22-23.  The influence of relationship status was modified by age and education: there was a positive influence of being in a couple on the risk of smoking among participants with post-secondary education between the ages of 22 and 25. 

Conclusions. ""Average"" effects provide a limited understanding of health inequalities during young adulthood. Research need to further address the dynamic and age-graded nature of young adult socioeconomic circumstances by investigating how these associations change over time and across socioeconomic groups."
What is health promotion? Using a lexical and citation analysis to advance our understanding of current health promotion research and practice.,"['Gagn√©, Thierry']",['N/A'],"['Bibliometry', 'Citation Analysis', 'Health Promotion Theory', 'Lexical Analysis', 'Multiple Correspondance Analysis']",2015.0,337221,"Within public health, health promotion (HP) is a recent field that stems from the confluence of multiple disciplines, including notably public health, sociology, psychology, political sciences and education. This multidisciplinarity has created great debate on the definition, role and functions of HP. This unfortunately contributes to the slowing progress of HP's development and institutionalization.  The aim of this project is thus to provide a complementary empirical perspective to this primarily conceptual debate. We used a three-pronged approach: (1) we developed a citation analysis to examine the most cited journals within Health Promotion International in 2013-2014; (2) we surveyed an international panel of HP scholars (n = 27) on the ten journals most relevant to their work; (2) we developed a lexical analysis of the most prevalent words among these journals' abstracts. We then examined similarities among scholars' choices, abstracts' words and references. We found that only one journal, Health Promotion International, was voted by more than 75% of our sample. We also found that research was often segregated into distinct subgroups, underlying some of the core tensions in the field. These results indicate that multidisciplinarity is a key feature of HP research and practice. If embraced, it can strengthen HP by enriching our understanding of health and social issues from a variety of perspectives. However, multidisciplinarity may also divide experts into specific disciplinary silos lacking a common field. To address this issue, we propose that more academic venues and institutions should be developed specifically to facilitate such work."
Do young adults represent a missed opportunity? Trends in smoking initiation in Canada,"['Gagn√©, Thierry']",['N/A'],"['Canada', 'Smoking', 'Social Inequalities', 'Young Adult']",1226.0,364522,"Young Canadians have enjoyed a stark decrease in smoking initiation in the last two decades. There is reason to believe, however, that (1) some groups such as those who are socioeconomically disadvantaged have not enjoyed this decrease and (2) young adults (18-25) have not either. This study used one of Statistics Canada's largest health database, the Canadian Community Health Survey, and examined changes in smoking initiation rates that occurred during youth and young adulthood among participants ages 25-26 between 2001 and 2013. Our results support that there has been no significant decrease in smoking initiation rates among youth who do not finish high school. We also found that there has been no change in initiation rates occurring during young adulthood during this period. We argue that public health instances should pay more attention to social inequalities and work to integrate young adults in their strategic planning."
"The lasting effects of influenza: Defining the causes and consequences of early life exposures on age-specific mortality later in life, 1890-2015","['Gagnon, Alain', 'Miller, Matthew S']","['Dillon, Lisa Y', 'Madrenas, Joaquin']","['Demography', 'Immunity', 'Influenza', 'Lifecourse', 'Mortality', 'Pandemics', 'Record Linkage']",100000.0,351789,"The worldwide spread of a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus in 2009 reminds us that influenza remains a significant threat to public health. This project builds on earlier investigations by our group showing a relationship between early life exposure to the 1890 Russian flu pandemic and young adult mortality during the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. Adding immunological assays and extending the observations to other pandemics as well as to usual seasonal flu during the 20th century in Canada and elsewhere, we explore immunological and physiological mechanisms connecting early life exposure and mortality from influenza later in life. We posit that exposure to a virulent strain of influenza during critical periods of development may result in physiological impairments that also increase the risk of death later in life, including from influenza itself. Additionally, development of immunological memory to an influenza strain in early life may result in a deregulated immune response to novel influenza virus strains encountered in later life, thereby increasing the risk of death. Drawing on historical and contemporary demographic and epidemiologic data, and taking advantage of the most recent advances in developmental biology and immunology, this cross-disciplinary project explores novel views about the peculiar age structure of mortality from influenza from 1890 to 2015."
Genetic epidemiology methods for medicine and population health in the big data era: Expanding the IGES network and knowledge dissimination,"['Gagnon, France', 'Greenwood, Celia M']",['N/A'],"['Access To Data Science Training', 'Bioinformatics', 'Dissemination Of Analytic Skills', 'Electronic Records For Health Research', 'Genetic Epidemiology', 'Health Outcomes', 'Integration Of Omics Data', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Skills To Advance Medicine And Population Health', 'Statistical Genetics']",7000.0,343609,"With the revolution in ascertaining genetic and genomic data in a high-throughput manner, a large percentage of today's research in the field of Human Genetics is directly based on analysis and interpretation of large data sets and high-dimensional data.

Internationally, routinely collected data - from health administration, electronic medical records, laboratories (clinical and public health), imaging services, and disease registries - are being used to measure clinical care, clinical trial outcomes, health system performance, trends in and determinants of the public health. With these new developments comes a need bigger than ever to bring mathematical and computational knowledge and skills relevant to genetic research to a broader audience of knowledge users."

Currently, there are no tools that take into account each person's combinations of factors and provide personalized recommendations about which factors have the biggest impact on health and should be acted on first. The objectives of my research are to develop a computer program that uses statistics to predict the risk of diabetes complications for different combinations of factors, and make recommendations to doctors about actions that will have the most beneficial impact on preventing complications; and to ask doctors, nurses and patients about how this program changed their treatment behaviour. This project makes an important step in turning evidence about how best to manage chronic diseases into action. The program I will develop may be adapted to different diseases and to use additional health databases in its calculations."
Assessing the Ethics of the Dominant Business Model in the Canadian Pharmaceutical Sector; Tackling Institutional Corruption through Regulatory Reforms,"['Gagnon, Marc-Andr√©']","['Kohler, Jillian C']","['Business Model', 'Cost And Prices Of Medicines', 'Ghostmanagement Of Medical Literature', 'Innovation Policies', 'Investment And Profitability', 'Off-Label Use', 'Pharmaceutical Promotion', 'Pharmaceutical Sector', 'Research Ethics', 'Therapeutic Innovation']",84204.0,255847,"Is the dominant business model of core pharmaceutical companies built on ethical foundations? Is the earning capacity of drug companies in line with the improvement of public health? In the last 15 years, fewer new drugs have arrived on the market, and the vast majority of them do not represent any therapeutic advancement as compared to what already exist. Nevertheless, dominant pharmaceutical companies are gaining record profits in spite of the lack of therapeutic innovation. This paradox can be explained if we consider the hypothesis that the main on-going business model is the aggressive promotion of me-too drugs in a way that institutionally corrode evidence-based medicine.

If this hypothesis is correct, it means that the profit-motive is not encouraging the development of new drugs.  Promotional expenditures surged during that period and medical research is ever more organized as a promotional campaign creating bias in medical practices. A growing amount of evidence shows the emergence of unethical practices in medical research for marketing purposes. For example, drug companies are systematically multiplying ghostwritten studies showing benefits for products, disclosure of adverse data in clinical trials is still incomplete and a growing amount of researchers have reported intimidation when they published adverse research results. 

The question before us is thus to understand if the profit-motive is embedded in a market structure encouraging unethical practices instead of innovative therapeutics. And if it is the case, what could be done to reconcile pharmaceutical profits and public health, especially when current innovation policies put in place by the Canadian government aim at increasing revenues instead of therapeutic innovation? What could be done in terms of regulatory reforms to re-organize the market structure in order to have a profit-motive serving the interests of patients as well? How can we reconcile business imperatives and health ethic"

Poorly managed symptoms can have a negative impact on the life and the health of PLWH. Symptom management can be challenging for PLWH for multiple reasons. Yet, research on this topic is fairly limited. It is estimated that as many as many as 14 to 37% of PLWH use cannabis to help manage symptoms such as appetite loss, wasting, nausea, vomiting, pain, anxiety, depression, stress, and insomnia. However, they tend to face important barriers to access medical cannabis and limited choices of product. As such, they continue to rely primarily on illegal sources to access cannabis. Canada is expected to legalize cannabis in 2018. This shift in policy could potentially improve symptom management for PLWH. Over the course of this study, we will interview PLWH who use cannabis for symptom management every year, for a total of 3 years. This will allow us to understand their needs, how legalization impacts them, and their use of cannabis in this changing context."
Exploring the Ethical Tensions and Professional Implications of Incentivized Health Care: The Case of HIV,"['Gagnon, Marilou', 'Guta, Adrian']","['Bungay, Victoria A', 'Murray, Stuart J', 'Upshur, Ross E']","['Aids', 'Case Study', 'Ethics', 'Hiv', 'Incentives', 'Qualitative']",100000.0,384304,"There is a growing interest in using incentives to encourage the uptake of health-related behaviours. This approach is based on the assumption that incentives can increase the perceived reward of health-related behaviours and, in turn, increase the likelihood that targeted individuals will engage in such behaviours. Incentives can be positive or negative. Positive incentives are direct rewards following the adoption of a desired behaviour or the achievement of a specific outcome. These are the most popular type of incentives in health care. In contrast, negative incentives are used by withdrawing a reward when an individual fails to adopt a desired behaviour or achieve a specific outcome. Incentives have been used in a variety of health care fields to encourage clinic attendance, follow-ups, treatment adherence, immunization, screening, smoking cessation, weight loss, healthy eating, exercise, drug abstinence, and breastfeeding. The use of incentives in health care is highly controversial. Yet, few studies have looked at the tensions and implications of this approach. The goal of this study is to examine these tensions and implications by analyzing documents and interviewing health professionals and service providers who have experience working with incentives in the field of HIV."

This CIHR dissemination grant will provide an opportunity for the Our Youth, Our Response (OYOR) research team to share key research findings with front line, policy and government partners working in the fields of youth-oriented HIV and Hepatitis C (Hep C) prevention. This will involve a face-to-face consultation meeting with HIV/HCV prevention experts from Nova Scotia as well as a series of interactive webinars with experts from the other Atlantic Provinces and elsewhere in Canada.

Who will be involved?
The prevention experts included in these activities will include formal healthcare providers, front line community workers, university-based health researchers, and representatives of community-based organizations who work in HIV/Hep C prevention, and/or with youth.

What will these activities involve?
Through these activities, the prevention experts will help the OYOR research team mobilize their key findings and recommendations to assist researchers, community organizations, and healthcare providers improve youth-oriented HIV/Hep C prevention policies and programs.

How will this event improve the health of Canadians?
These activities have the potential to: 1. Improve the health of young Canadians by making youth-oriented HIV/Hep C prevention more effective by increasing awareness among prevention experts of the approaches that work best with youth populations; and 2. Make youth-oriented HIV/Hep C prevention more effective by providing prevention experts working in areas with limited resources with evidence-based recommendations for meeting the unique prevention needs and challenges faced by youth and those who work with youth."

In this CBR catalyst grant we will look at mapping where HIV POCT pilot programs have been offered in Canada from 2005 (the year when the HIV POCT test 'INSTI' first became available for use in Canada) until 2016, which communities and priority populations have been served, and where gaps in access exist and why. With our community partners, we will share and present these findings nationally. We will also use the findings to develop a larger CIHR operating grant to look more closely at the ways in which select HIV POCT pilots have been expanded and sustained over time using a case study approach."
Testing the effectiveness of a message framing KT intervention,"['Gainforth, Heather L']",['N/A'],"['Knowledge Translation', 'Message Framing', 'Public Health', 'Sexual Health', ""Women'S Health""]",105000.0,206120,"Communicating health information in terms of the benefits of engaging in a behaviour or the costs of failing to engage in a behaviour can persuade people to practice safe sexual health practices including using condoms, getting a pap test, and getting vaccinated. Yet, health messages are rarely correctly written by applied health organizations such as public health. This means that it is important to research how to effectively communicate the findings from sexual health communication research to public health agencies. The proposed research will consist of three studies aiming to evaluate and strengthen the use of proper sexual health messages within 36 public health agencies in Ontario. In Study 1, I will evaluate the content of existing sexual health websites and brochures from public health agencies to determine whether their messages are correctly conveying information. In Study 2, I will develop a program that will teach the same Ontario public health agencies used in Study 1 to correctly create sexual health messages. The effectiveness of the program will be measured by re-evaluating the agencies' sexual health brochures and websites. In Study 3, I will develop an understanding of the causes of whether or not public health agencies correctly create sexual health messages. I will assess what resources and materials help and hinder agencies' ability to correctly use sexual health communication research. The results of the three studies will help improve the health of Canadians by ensuring that public health agencies are using the most effective research evidence and by providing insight as to how to effectively provide public health agencies with scientific recommendations."

When researchers do try to partner, they are often accused of tokenism (i.e. asking research users to endorse research to legitimize programs over which they have little real control). The gap separating research discovery and implementation is of particular concern for the over 86,000 individuals with spinal cord injuries (SCI) in Canada. SCI results from damage to the spinal cord due to trauma or disease and leads to partial or complete paralysis and sensory impairment. 

To combat tokenism in spinal cord injury (SCI) research and enhance research impact, a multidisciplinary partnership of researchers, research users, and/or funders was established to develop guidance to advance meaningful, equitable, and authentic research partnerships. This partnership systematically and rigorously co-developed, disseminated, and evaluated ""integrated knowledge translation (IKT) guiding principles for conducting and disseminating SCI research in partnership"". Our eight principles represent what is desirable and positive for conducting quality, inclusive, and ethical SCI research in partnership.

In the Fall of 2020, our IKT Guiding Principles were published.  In February 2021, the partnership led a coordinated launch of the principles in both French and English (see www.IKTprinciples.com). Our partnership has been internationally recognized as global leaders in advancing the science of integrated knowledge translation (IKT) and addressing tokenism in SCI research. Together, we are combatting tokenism and improving the quality and quantity of SCI research partnerships. In turn, we are evolving the field of research partnership in Canada and internationally amongst researchers, research users, and funding agencies within and beyond SCI research."
Exploring Attitudes and Anticipated Uptake of a COVID-19 Vaccine among Patients with Chronic Illnesses in the Canadian Maritimes,"['Gallant, Allyson J']",['N/A'],"['Behaviour Change', 'Complex Conditions', 'Covid-19 Vaccination Research', 'Mixed Methods Research Approach', 'Vaccination Hesitancy']",105000.0,439541,"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the world we live in. Until a vaccine is developed, strict public health measures will need to be in place to prevent transmission of this infectious disease. As we wait for a COVID-19 vaccine, there is a need to identify attitudes and beliefs about a future vaccine to ensure uptake once it is available to the public. Uptake will be vital in patients with chronic illnesses, as they are a high-risk group who have received little attention during pandemic planning to date. Vaccine hesitancy, or concerns around vaccination, is a significant threat to global health and may affect uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine. The proposed project aims to understand the attitudes and barriers to anticipated uptake of the future COVID-19 vaccine among patients living with chronic conditions in the Maritimes. A three-phase study will address this research question. First, a survey will be conducted with patients across the Maritimes to explore attitudes, beliefs and anticipated uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine. These findings will be used to develop an interview guide to conduct in-depth interviews with patients and stakeholders, including physicians, pharmacists and nurse practitioners, to investigate barriers and enablers to vaccine uptake. Evidence from these two phases will be used to co-design an intervention with patients and stakeholders to help maximize uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in high-risk patients. Understanding barriers to vaccinating against COVID-19 is necessary for improving quality of life and health outcomes in patients at high-risk for COVID-19 living in the Maritimes."
A qualitative study of the experience of cancer and death from cancer among Inuit residents of Nunavut using Indigenous and Western methodologies,"['Galloway, Tracey L']","['Doucette, Michelle M', 'Ingebrigtson, Linnea', 'Healey Akearok, Gwen K', 'Woodgate, Roberta L']","['Cancer', 'Death', 'Diagnosis And Treatment', 'End-Of-Life Care', 'Experiential', 'Illness', 'Indigenous Knowledge', 'Nunavut Inuit', 'Population Health', 'Qualitative Methods']",404472.0,291157,"A recent assessment of cancer in Nunavut has revealed that all-cause cancer incidence is significantly higher than in Canada as a whole. The absence of cancer diagnostic and treatment services in Nunavut necessitates long, frequent and costly periods of travel for cancer patients, compounded by the stress of isolation from family and community. It also means that many cancers are detected at advanced stages. Cancer mortality is higher in Nunavut than anywhere else in Canada, and that reality shapes the public perception of cancer. ""In Nunavut, 'cancer' means 'death',"" said one Iqaluit resident. Following recent efforts by the Government of Nunavut to determine the scope of cancer in the territory, we undertake an evaluation of the experience of cancer diagnosis and treatment from the perspective of patients, families and communities. The theoretical framework of the research employs the Two-eyed Seeing Model by blending Western methodologies with Indigenous models wherein knowledge is both experiential and relational. The research will use a combination of phenomenological-hermeneutics and the Inuit epistemology Piliriqatigiiniq to explore the development of contemporary narratives about cancer, and how those narratives further shape the experience of diagnosis, treatment and recovery. What is it like for Nunavummiut to experience cancer diagnosis and treatment? What supports exist, either formal or informal, for cancer patients and their families in Nunavut communities? What are the challenges or obstacles faced by cancer patients and their families? Given the high mortality of cancer in the north, this research will also explore the process of death. What does it mean to die by cancer in Nunavut? What issues are raised by the narrative of cancer death and how do they influence the cultural and community bonds that lie at the heart of Nunavut society?"
Water Quality and Human Health in a Changing Climate: Gastro-Intestinal Illness in Small Communities in British Columbia,"['Galway, Lindsay P']",['N/A'],"['Epidemiology', 'Gastrointestinal Illness', 'Geographic Information System', 'Health Impacts Of Climate Change', 'Hydrology', 'Population Health', 'Spatio-Temporal Patterns Of Disease', 'Water Quality']",105000.0,229639,"High-quality drinking water is fundamental to maintaining and protecting human health and well-being. As water supply and distribution infrastructure ages, land-use and climatic patterns change, and water sources become more vulnerable to contamination, drinking water quality will become an increasingly important public health concern in Canada. Of particular concern is the contamination of drinking water by waterborne pathogens causing gastro-intestinal (GI) illness.
Drinking water quality is threatened by contamination with waterborne pathogens that exist in the environment and enter drinking water supplies via various pathways. Once pathogens enter a drinking water supply, waterborne GI illness outbreaks and sporadic cases are likely to occur in the absence of effective water treatment.
Our current understanding of risk factors for poor water quality and its relationship to waterborne GI illness is limited.
Recent research has indicated that extreme weather events and climatic factors may be linked to poor drinking water
quality and disease. Additionally, characteristics of drinking water systems have been shown to influence the incidence
of illness in various settings. This project will examine the complex relationship between weather and climatic parameters, water quality and human health in eight small communities across British Columbia. Understanding this relationship will enable an evaluation of the potential impacts of climate change on water quality and human health and therefore can be used to identify possibilities for adaptation in Canada and other settings. Final study results will be disseminated to relevant decision-makers in public health and water management circles. Ultimately, this study will address current research gaps and contribute to improving water quality and protecting human
health in a changing climate."
Comparative Safety and Effectiveness of Antidiabetic Medications,"['Gamble, John-Michael']",['N/A'],"['Diabetes', 'Drug Safety And Effectiveness', 'Health Outcomes', 'Pharmacoepidemiology']",300000.0,270166,"Medications used to treat type 2 diabetes are studied extensively prior to approval by regulatory authorities. However, our understanding of a medication's effectiveness in an everyday clinical setting, the chance of rare adverse effects, and its long-term effects is very limited. In other words for individuals living with type 2 diabetes, a medication's potential to cause unintended side effects - and even any beneficial effects it might have on reducing the complications of diabetes long-term (e.g. cardiovascular disease) - are unknown when the medication is first marketed. Given the increasing numbers of people with type 2 diabetes worldwide, an evaluation of the postmarketing safety and effectiveness of medications for type 2 diabetes is essential for improving the care for these individuals. 

My research over the next 5 years will focus on studying the risks and benefits of both the newest antidiabetic medications (the incretins) and older, understudied medications (insulin). I propose to study these medications using a database of detailed healthcare records for individuals with type 2 diabetes.  This database will include information on: prescription medication use, diagnoses, laboratory tests, and hospitalizations and death. Using the information in the database, I will assess the risk and benefits of incretin-based therapies and insulin therapy compared to other commonly used antidiabetic therapies. Moreover, I will systematically assess if there are any specific effects within certain groups of patients such as males and females, those with poor or normal kidney function, and other sociodemographic, clinical, and health system characteristics. Ultimately, my research program will contribute to our understanding of the real world effects of antidiabetic medications, and will inform patients, clinicians, and policymakers of the potential harms and benefits of these medications when used in everyday clinical practice."

SGLT2 receptors are mediators of glucose uptake that ensure the reabsorption of glucose in the renal tubules.  SGLT2 inhibitors work by inhibiting these mediators, and thus increase the urinary excretion of the filtered glucose. Although these medications are studied extensively prior to being approved, the extent to which they cause unintended side effects, especially when they are used in real life conditions is not well known. Notably, federal regulatory agencies such as Health Canada and the US Food and Drug Administration have published warnings regarding several safety signals arising from patient reports. Given the increasing use of SGLT2 inhibitors in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, better evaluation of their post-marketing safety is required. 

We propose to study the real world safety of SGLT2 inhibitors using a combination of large databases from the US, UK and Canada that contains detailed healthcare records for individuals with diabetes. These databases will include information on prescription medication use, diagnoses, laboratory tests (e.g., cholesterol levels, kidney function), and information on hospitalizations and death. To evaluate the overall risk-benefit profile of these medications, we will measure the risk of acute kidney disease, renal impairment, infections (urinary tract infections, genital infections), too much acid in the blood, and amputation for individuals receiving SGLT2 inhibitors versus other oral diabetes therapies. For all of these analyses we will use advanced statistical analysis to account for differences in age, sex, and disease burden.
   
Our study will contribute towards understanding the real world effects of the SGLT2 inhibitors and will help patients, clinicians, and policymakers assess the overall risks and benefits of these medications."
Healthy IDEAS+: A Modified Effectiveness-Implementation Trial to Improve Cognition in Community Housing,"['Gan, Daniel R']",['N/A'],"['Cognition', 'Community-Based Intervention', 'Depression', 'Implementation Science', 'Mental Health', 'Neighbourhood', 'Older Adults', 'Pathways', 'Social Cohesion', 'Urban Housing']",31583.0,446277,"Healthy IDEAS is an evidence-based depression screening and behavioural activation program that is widely-implemented among older adults in community settings. Late-life depression increases cognitive decline. A 17-year cohort study reported 70% greater risk of dementia when one has depression. Loneliness and depression are connected in the prodromal phase of dementia. Community-based screening and treatment for depression might improve memory and reduce risk of dementia. However, the effect of mental health programs such as Healthy IDEAS on cognitive function is unknown. Its effectiveness in group settings such as community housing is also unknown. 

This research aims to understand (1) the effectiveness of Healthy IDEAS on depression and cognitive function in community housing, and (2) the barriers and facilitators of group-based implementation with peer support. Community housing are provided by the province and by non-profit organisations to meet the needs of healthy older adults and populations with limited income. They typically do not include social programming. As a result, some older adults may experience isolation and loneliness, which affect their mental health. The proposed ""Healthy IDEAS+"" program encourages activities and introduces peer support to older adults who show depressive symptoms. A trial will be implemented over three months. We hypothesise that participation in Healthy IDEAS+ will decrease depression and improve memory after 12 months. 

To understand barriers of implementation in community housing, we will engage housing providers and participants in interviews and focus groups. The ease and usefulness of each behavioural activation session and the overall program will be evaluated. A training manual will be developed for future implementations in community housing. This research is important to eliminate depression in community housing and create health-promoting settings. This research supports dementia prevention in urban housing."
Everyday Cognitive Resilience: Mechanistic Study of Neurobiological Stress Process in Racialized and/or Less Advantaged Neighbourhoods,"['Gan, Daniel R']",['N/A'],"['Brain Health', 'Neighbourhood Effects']",,460066,"Where we live affects cognitive decline. Neighbourhood deprivation is correlated with smaller hippocampal volume at death, even after controlling for race and individual socioeconomic status (Hunt et al., 2020). Mechanistic studies of neighbourhood effects are required to translate findings into interventions to address place-based cognitive health disparities. Given structural inequities, which continue to manifest as socioeconomic segregation (Soja, 2009), multi-faceted solutions are required. Besides inter-subjective variables (e.g., sociocultural practices), intra-subjective responses (e.g., loneliness) further mediate these neighbourhood effects (Gan et al., 2022). Parsing apart these layers of psychosocial variables will allow planning and implementing responsive interventions to mitigate place-based disparities in cognitive health more effectively along the loneliness-cognition axis or the ""stress connectome"" (Cacioppo et al., 2014; Dum et al., 2019). 

This project invites older adults as study participants from poorer neighbourhoods to examine psychosocial mechanisms of cognitive health disparities in Detroit and Vancouver. Multi-phase recruitment will be carried out to recruit clusters of older adults with and without experiences of loneliness and/or discrimination within a 2x2 matrix of high/low cohesion and aggregated cognition. Neighbourhood (e.g., atmosphere), psychosocial (e.g., rumination), and cognitive (e.g., semantic fluency) variables will be measured before two structured interviews per person. First, stories of positive and negative informal social experiences in the neighbourhood will be documented at baseline while brain activity is examined with fMRI. Second, selected stories will be played at 6-month and 9-month as stimuli for all participants to examine the protective effect of neighbourhood variables on brain activity during these accounts, controlling for baseline."

Through 12 focus groups, we engaged older adults with and without subthreshold depression to (1) co-develop a place-based wellness model that leverages existing community resources, and (2) piloted a multi-component 8-week realist controlled trial to test the feasibility of the model as an auto-referral algorithm for future scaling up with 78 older adults. The engagement was inclusive and supportive with mutual respect to co-build impactful solutions that will address gaps from older adults' perspectives. Knowledge mobilization outputs include (1) the Cohesion, At-homeness, and joyful Play (CAP) model which has been incorporated into (2) the BC Preventive Social Prescribing web app, a closed-loop auto-referral platform to increase uptake of active living and mobility activities by (3) addressing psychosocial barriers and building community through the co-developed Finding Meaning in Aging (FMA) mindful discussion program.

It is currently the fourth leading cause of death globally and is expected to be the third leading cause of death by 2030. Many population studies have also shown that the prevalence of COPD is greater in females than in males. The underlying causes and sex differences of COPD are not fully understood. It is generally believed that exposure to noxious particles or gases, such as smoking and air pollution, and an individual's genetic makeup plays an important role. Many genes have been associated with COPD. However, limited information is available on individuals who are genetically susceptible to the risk of COPD associated with air pollution exposure. This study aims to investigate harmful air pollution exposures and individuals who are at higher risk of COPD associated with these exposures in males and females, respectively.  The findings of this research will have the potential to influence and shape public, occupational, and environmental health policies aimed at mitigating health risks associated with air pollution exposures and the need for more robust advocacy for clean air in vulnerable and general populations."

During this meeting we will share experiences and consolidate evidence garnered from an in-depth review of relevant literature, best practices, and government policies/programs from around the world and gain a better understanding of the indicators that may create positive experiences of caring. One outcome is to provide evidence-informed culturally-sensitive key messages that resonate with an international audience about the positive impact of caring for older adults. The second outcome is to address the international differences in programs offered caregivers in participating countries by writing a position paper about existing, successful and feasible policies worldwide that support the positive aspects of caring. The paper will include the commonalities, differences, costs and evidence supporting or refuting the existing policies around caring for older adults. The third outcome is to design a future comprehensive international collaborative study that will look at the factors contributing to patterns of positive trajectories of caring. Through this research, we would identify patterns of positive caregiving experiences as they are shaped by personal, social, political and economic factors. This would create knowledge about the socio-economic and psychological predictors of positive experiences of caring for older adults.
The development of positive messages around caregiving can improve personal health of caregivers and can improve the health populations of the older person requiring care. It is crucial to support the rapidly aging society with a strong caregiver base that is not perceived as an overwhelming burden but as a positive force that enriches the lives of all impacted. The effect of caring for older adults is a worldwide phenomenon and we can learn from each other about the positive patterns of care."

Older people who lose this ability often can't stay in their homes and are more likely to become sick or depressed. Mobility aids (e.g., canes, walkers and wheelchairs) help people stay mobile so physical therapists and doctors often prescribe them to older adults. For some people however, accepting and using a mobility device is a challenge and many older adults who need a device do not use them. This is a problem because without the device people may stay at home and become isolated or they may go outside and are more likely to fall. It is also a waste of healthcare dollars because the government pays for a proportion of these aids and many sit abandoned in garages and closets. 

There has been some research to understand why ""some use and others refuse"" their devices. Cost, training, and the way a device works all affect whether an older person will use their device. We are also learning that things like feeling embarrassed or fearful to use the device also affects use.  Despite all of this research however, we still don't really understand the complicated relationship between older adults and their mobility devices. 

The purpose of this grant is to better understand this. 'Reinventing the wheel' brings together a diverse group of people who have experience with this issue including researchers, clinicians, policy makers, designers and older adults themselves. In a 2-day meeting, attendees will share what they have learned and together the group will develop new ways to promote use and more widely share what they have learned. The team believes that the meeting will have an immediate impact on the day-to-day work of attendees and also help to launch new research projects that can better support older adults to adopt and use their devices."

Famciclovir is similar to acyclovir in its treatment of shingles but famciclovir does not appear to have the same damaging effects on the kidneys. We will study the risk of kidney damage from certain drugs used to treat shingles by observing all older patients in Ontario who were prescribed these drugs. In this population study of older adults, our goal is to understand how widespread this problem is and how the risk with acyclovir compares to that with famciclovir. This is an important area of research since the number of people over age 65 will increase to almost 6 million in Canada by the year 2016, with over 126,000 people being treated with these types of drugs on an annual basis.

We also know very little about the risk of bone fractures in people who donate one of their kidneys to someone in need. There are surgical and long-term medical risks from having one kidney removed. On the other hand, the person receiving the kidney has the benefit of a longer and better life. We understand the surgical risks of donating a kidney quite well, but we know less about the long-term medical risks. This study will help us understand whether kidney disease and kidney donation increase a person's long-term risk of breaking a bone. We will study 80,000 older adults with kidney disease (over 250,000 older adults in total) and 2,000 kidney donors. We will examine health records from 1992 to 2010 to find their fracture risk compared to people with healthy kidneys. The knowledge we gain will guide trials to prevent bone fractures in people with kidney disease and in living kidney donors.

Evaluating the Safety and Effectiveness of Evolving Opioid Agonist Therapy Prescribing Patterns,"['Garg, Ria']",['N/A'],"['Comparative Drug Safety', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Opioid Use Disorder', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacovigilance']",105000.0,475670,"Canada's opioid-related deaths epidemic is a growing public health emergency, claiming 29,000 lives since 2016. Although early in the overdose epidemic, prescription opioids were commonly implicated in fatal overdoses, the emergence of fentanyl in Canada's unregulated drug supply has led to a shift in the drivers of opioid-related harms. Specifically, in 2021 fentanyl was detected in 92% of opioid-related deaths across Ontario. Given fentanyl's high potency, people with opioid use disorder often report dissatisfaction with traditional first line opioid agonist therapy (OAT), placing them at increased risk of harm following treatment discontinuation. This shift in Canada's opioid landscape has led to the introduction of new treatment approaches for opioid use disorder, including recommendations for the use of high dose methadone, combination therapy with methadone and slow-release oral morphine, and newer formulations of buprenorphine. However, real-world evidence surrounding the harms and benefits of these new approaches is currently lacking. Using data on all hospital admissions, emergency department visits, prescriptions dispensed from retail pharmacies, and opioid-related deaths in the province of Ontario, Canada, I propose a body of work that will describe evolution of prescribing patterns for OAT and evaluate the impact of these new treatment approaches on patient care outcomes. My work will be used to inform optimal medication management for opioid use disorder in the context of the fentanyl-era, revise therapeutic guidelines and guide clinical decision-making. Findings will also be used by drug-policy decision makers in Ontario and across Canada, to inform future policy development and refinement, with the aim of reducing the number of lives lost to Canada's toxic drug supply."

Studies have found a link between neighbourhood characteristics and depression, but the evidence is not well established. Critical gaps still exist in the literature. For instance, little is known about what specific neighbourhood features matter most for depression. How people perceive their environment (e.g. safety, cleanliness and community attachment) and objective characteristics of neighbourhoods (e.g.: green spaces, neighbourhood deprivation and access to recreational facilities) may affect mood differently. It is also unclear for whom this effect is most relevant. Because people with a chronic condition such as diabetes may have less mobility and fewer resources, they might be particularly vulnerable to the quality of their neighbourhood; yet no research has focused on this population. This project proposes to shed light on these questions. The researcher will use data from participants of two large health surveys and will identify the characteristics of neighbourhoods from three sources: national censuses, geographic information systems, and a telephone interview, which will be created to assess the perception that participants have of their neighbourhood. The researcher will use advanced statistical methods to clarify the mechanism by which neighbourhood might affect depressive moods in people with and without diabetes. Findings from this work will provide valuable insight into the mechanism by which the neighbourhood environment may influence mental health, it will help identify vulnerable groups and precarious residential situations that may benefit from interventions, and will guide policy-makers and urban planners in making neighbourhoods happier places to live."

How does relative income deprivation during childhood impact adolescent mental health? Testing the critical period and accumulation of risk hypotheses.,"['Gari√©py, Genevi√®ve']",['N/A'],"['Adolescence', 'Epidemiology', 'Ics Travel Awards', 'Income Inequalities', 'Longitudinal Analysis', 'Mediation Analysis', 'Mental Health', 'Socioeconomic Determinants', 'Survey Data']",2332.0,344077,"Introduction: Growing up in an impoverished or unequal economic environment contributes to mental health problems in youths, but how this happens is still unclear. One hypothesis is that there may be a time during childhood, such as early childhood, when children are more vulnerable to income deprivation (sensitive period model). Another hypothesis suggests that it may be the repeated and cumulative exposure to income deprivation that affects the development of mental health in youth (accumulation of risk model). In this project, we tested both hypotheses to examine how income deprivation in childhood might impact adolescent mental health.

Methods: The study used data from a large survey of 2234 adolescents from the United States (Child Development Supplements of the US Panel Study of Income Dynamics). The survey collected information on household income every year dating back to the birth year of the adolescents. We estimated relative income deprivation by categorizing household income into quintiles. Adolescent mental health was measured from 12 questions. We used advanced statistical techniques to test the sensitive period model. We calculated the number of years that children spent in income deprivation to test the accumulation of risk model. We controlled for family characteristics in the analyses.

Results: We found that each year spent in income deprivation negatively affected the level of mental health of adolescents. There was no evidence of a specific time period during childhood when children were more sensitive to income deprivation. 

Conclusion: Results from this study suggests that the accumulated effect of income deprivation is what affects youth mental health, irrespective of when it occurred during childhood."
Social and structural determinants of youth mental health: potential mechanisms for policy and interventions,"['Gari√©py, Genevi√®ve']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,399902,"Youth mental health is a global public health priority and a complex phenomenon involving a wide and interactive range of biological, family, and environmental factors. The aim of my research program is to study the social and structural determinants of youth mental health to inform effective policies and strategies that can promote and protect youth mental health in Canada and worldwide. 

My research program aligns with IPPH's research priority of Global health policy by conducting policy-relevant research on challenges with global implications for youth health. For example, one of my projects investigates school policies, environmental, and family factors on youth sleep and mental health. I leverage data from national and international surveys that I link to external political (e.g., school policies), economic (e.g., national income inequality) and geographic data (e.g. light pollution) to answer policy-relevant questions. I am developing another project to assess the structure of school schedules and its impact on the health, behaviours, and well-being of adolescents. Findings from this project could transform the way schools worldwide design their schedule to optimize youth development and health and provide a launching pad for a novel line of international research into school schedule policies. I am also involved in other projects with global health policy implications such as studies on food insecurity and child nutritional and mental health in high and low-income countries; the mental health of young people who are neither at school nor at work - a growing and vulnerable group worldwide; and the developmental trajectories of mental health problems among adolescents in urban India and Sri Lanka.

My research program also aligns with the IPPH's mandate to support research into the complex biological, social, cultural and environmental interactions that determine health and make this knowledge applicable to improve the health of individuals and populations."

In 20 years it has been used in over 1000 studies including needs assessments, surveys, and evaluations of decision aids and other patient decision support interventions. The DCS is available for patients/surrogate decision makers in 4 different formats, 14 different languages, and 2 mode of administration. As well, there is a version for healthcare professionals. There have been many challenges and lessons learned in using the measure for different populations, languages, decision makers, and decision contexts. We aim to bring patients, health professionals, and researchers together with DCS Experts in a series of skill-building, lively, and informative conversations about the successes and challenges of using the DCS in both the research and clinical settings.
We propose  a workshop with an interactive, ""world caf√©"" approach, intended for patients, health professionals, and researchers who have used, worked with, or are considering using the DCS. First, we will provide an overview of 20 years of DCS-use. Second we will have small group discussions facilitated by recognized DCS-experts. Overall, participants will benefit from the opportunity to learn from the experts and share and learn about the theoretical underpinings, methodological issues, and practical challenges that have been encountered in using the DCS. Participants will have the opportunity to: 1) Learn about the history of and the evidence behind the DCS, 2) Reflect on the different mode of analyses and interpretation of DCS results, 3) Share experiences with some of the most well-known DCS Experts, 4) Reflect on arising challenges around use of the DCS, and 5) Consider future use of the DCS for research or clinical practice."
International Comparison of Informal Caregivers' Experiences in Decision-making with Seniors,"['Garvelink, Mirjam M']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],,345389,"Worldwide, the population is aging. With increasing numbers of seniors, healthcare systems depend more and more on the help of caregivers to assist and provide care to seniors. However, little is known about the role of caregivers in helping seniors make decisions about their care, especially when many kinds of healthcare professional are involved. One of the most difficult decisions is about moving home. An earlier study showed that caregivers lack information and support for helping seniors make this decision, and can feel guilty or regretful afterwards.
This decision is not only influenced by the needs and preferences of seniors, their caregivers and the different healthcare professionals looking after them, but also by national and regional policies. To explore decision-making about where the senior should live, we propose to assess the decision-making experiences of everyone involved in this decision, i.e. the seniors, their caregivers and various health professionals, in two different countries and four regions, each with different healthcare systems and policies about senior housing. For this, we propose a mixed-methods study using interviews and questionnaires with all who are involved in decision-making to explore, quantify and compare their experiences. 
This study will increase our understanding of the experience of decision-making in Canada and the Netherlands of all who involved with these difficult decisions. We can then design tools and training that will help caregivers and healthcare professionals to be more effective in helping seniors make the decision about moving."

This scoping review meets a call for information identified at a multisectoral, multidisciplinary meeting held in Edmonton in late 2008. Policymakers and practitioners noted there is a burgeoning need for a synthesis on the growing literature on built environments and health for older citizens. Since older citizens' needs vary by context, there is a need for a cohesive and coordinated evaluation of supranational, international, national, regional, and local policy and practices. Such an evaluation would support the policy developments needed to encourage age-friendly environments in specific geographical contexts, such as the Prairies."

Dietary intake is a potentially modifiable contributor to excess body weight; however, research on the dietary intakes of on-reserve Aboriginal people in Canada is scarce. Health improvement strategies are needed to improve the current situation.  The objective of this research is to evaluate the current nutrition environment and utilize a participatory, community-driven approach to reduce the incidence and prevalence of overweight, obesity, and diabetes in the communities of the Mushkegowuk Territory, on the Western coast of James Bay. This will first involve the evaluation of the current nutrition environment in these communities following the implementation of the Nutrition North subsidy program, which is hypothesized to have remained poor. It will then include the implementation and evaluation of sustainable community-driven strategies to improve the accessibility and affordability of healthy foods, namely vegetables and fruit and traditional game meats, through harvest sharing and community garden projects. As cost and availability are major barriers to healthy eating in these communities, it is hypothesized that these strategies will improve dietary intakes and community cohesion through harvest sharing. Data collection methods will include a validated web-based questionnaire (24-hour recall, food frequency questionnaire) to assess dietary intakes at baseline and post-program.  Focus group methodology will be used in the formative stages, as well as for program evaluation.  This research will contribute to the paucity of data on the dietary intakes of on-reserve Aboriginal people in Canada and aims to improve these intakes using sustainable, innovative, community-driven approaches."

Given the diversity of challenges faced by each FN community, research into locally acceptable, effective, and sustainable public health initiatives to improve diets and physical activity levels is of value. This, however, is challenging when there exists few (or no) validated tools to measure physical activity and eating habits in FN youth living in the remote north.  The goal of this research is to validate tools that will inform improved public health interventions to decrease the burden of chronic disease in FN populations. It is hypothesized that the availability of such tools will provide an improved understanding of diet and physical activity patterns, and support sustainable public health interventions for improved nutrition and physical activity habits. A mix of quantitative and qualitative methods will be used to obtain a measure of physical activity in a large sample of FN youth in northern Ontario and to identify the appropriateness of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire in this population; to validate a measure of physical activity among on-reserve FN youth living in remote, northern locations; and to evaluate the appropriateness of the Healthy Eating Index for on-reserve FN youth. Community members will be collaborators at all phases of the project. The tools generated by this research will help to inform interventions to reduce current health inequities and, in turn, draw the attention of key decision-makers to take further action to adequately support successful interventions."

Modeling hospital intervention strategies for infectious disease control using novel contact networks,"['Gauld, Jillian S']",['N/A'],"['Contact Networks', 'Health Policy', 'Infectious Disease', 'Mathematical Modeling', 'Pandemic Preparedness']",17500.0,280798,"Airborne, respiratory infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 influenza have an incredible potential to become widespread, pandemic infections, and are often difficult to fully characterize and contain. Mathematical disease modeling has become increasingly relevant in the area of pandemic preparedness, combining the fields of mathematics, statistics, and public health in order predict the impact of outbreaks, and the efficacy of various intervention strategies. 

Since many disease models are based on assumptions of contact between infected persons in a community, they are often limited in their representation of true population dynamics. With a need for more accurate and detailed contact predictions, data from radio-frequency identification (RFID), and cellular phone technologies are becoming increasingly relevant.  Hospitals, in particular, are an effective place to study contact networks, since employees have the capacity to spread an infection throughout the hospital and affect the surrounding community. 

I aim to develop a detailed hospital contact network, in order to test the effectiveness of infectious disease intervention strategies in a hospital setting. My project utilizes RFID hospital contact data to create a detailed contact network. Data from the SARS epidemic, which experienced a high rate of hospital related transmissions, will be used to test my model. The dynamics of disease spread through the network model will demonstrate the relative efficacy of each infection control strategy.

This study utilizes a novel method for contact network development, and will provide a thorough and accurate assessment of infection control strategies within hospital settings. The results of this study have the potential to be expanded to infection control strategies at the provincial, national, and international level."

With the aging of the baby boomer cohort, more older adults will have to live with chronic disabilities and require assistance in performing activities of daily living. Fortunately, many technologies are being developed to help individuals self-manage their chronic disabilities (CD) and become more autonomous. These technologies can enable older adults to remain autonomous in their community-dwellings and actively participate in society. Information and communication technologies (ICT) are one of the types of technologies that help these older adults self-manage their daily activities and promote social inclusion. Healthcare in Canada is managed at the provincial level and therefore it is important to look at the political strategies in place in the different ministries of health. Specifically, this project will focus on the Ontario healthcare system. Currently, Ontario offers a Chronic Disease Prevention and Management (CDPM) framework to inform prevention and management strategies. This framework is informational but does not offer legislative directions for individuals who are self-managing or wish to self-manage their CD with ICTs. This project will advance health policy actions in Ontario for older adults with CD by proposing a conceptual framework that could later be adapted to the healthcare models of the other Canadian provinces and implemented based on their identified needs."

AMR is one of the top global public health threats facing society and is recognized as a global health emergency. One cause of AMR is the failure to complete a course of treatment, leading to the spread of drug-resistant strains. Forced treatment, defined as treatment administered without the consent of the patient, has been implemented in the past for multi drug-resistant tuberculosis and is legally permitted in some Canadian jurisdictions for certain infectious diseases. However, limited attention has been given to the ethical justification of forced treatment in a context where diseases with AMR become increasingly common. Research that examines the complex ethical considerations of forced treatment as an increasingly important option for infectious diseases with AMR potential is urgently needed. The objective of this research is to describe the current international ethical landscape of forced treatment for infectious diseases; identify which diseases (and disease characteristics) have stronger ethical justifications for forced treatment; and examine how ethical values can be applied in AMR response and policy development. This qualitative, mixed-methods study will include key informant interviews with Medical Officers of Health across Canada, as well as a content analysis of relevant public health emergency response and infectious disease policy documents from Canada, the United States, and United Kingdom. This research serves to promote the health of populations by preventing the spread of emerging disease threats, reducing morbidity and mortality, and by doing so in a way that is ethically defensible.

PBSPs make bicycles available at stations in a city and anyone can use them for a small cost. People who walk and cycle for transportation get more physical activity and are less overweight than people who don't. . Walking and cycling for transportation can be dangerous because roads are shared with cars and when a walker or biker is hit by a car they normally get very injured. This proposal builds on our past research and studies whether or not starting a public bicycle share program in a city increases cycling and collisions between cyclists and cars. People living in different cities with and without public bike share programs will be compared. We will do three Iinternet surveys in 5 cities where there are or will be bicycle share programs. These cities are Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, Boston, and New York City. We will compare changes in cycling and collisions in these cities to similar cities without bicycle share programs. These similar cities are Detroit, Philadelphia, and Chicago. We will do surveys in the spring of 2012, the fall of 2012, and the fall of 2013. We will ask questions about health, knowledge and use of public bicycle share programs, cycling, experiences of collisions with cars, and information about age, sex and income. In our analysis we will compare cycling and collisions between cities.

Major works were undertaken to install drains and eliminate unhealthy housing, notably by prohibiting dwelling units in basements and windowless rooms. These efforts were very successful as infectious disease rates decreased and did so well before the advent of antibiotics. 

Initially in developed countries and now in developing nations, there have been major increases in chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and several cancers. Now, at the beginning of the 21st century, to counter these threats to population health, Public Health Departments have forged new alliances with major Canadian cities. Together, they are working to create environments that foster the supply of healthy and affordable food, enhance the practice of physical activity, and reduce the risks of road injuries.

Our research program aims to study these cross-sector approaches, which involve collaborations between health practitioners, municipalities, representatives from civil society, housing authorities, and actors from other sectors. We will study the effectiveness of partnerships aimed at transforming built environments to increase the availability of fruit and vegetables, promote active transport and physical activity, and improve availability of affordable housing. We will also look into how these partnerships take into account social and gender inequalities. To carry out these studies and make comparisons, we will rely on the active participation of the Directors of the Public Health Organizations of Montreal, Saskatoon, Toronto, and Vancouver. Ultimately, we will identify the factors that lead to success in forward-looking initiatives aimed at preventing the new epidemics of chronic diseases."

Many cases could be prevented if a greater number of Canadians adopted healthy eating and physical activity. Existing research shows that health promotion programs aimed at individuals and transformations of built and social environments could help Canadians adopt more healthy lifestyles if implemented jointly. In order to implement health promotion programs and transformations of built environments to promote healthy eating and physical activity, public health officials, governments, and their partners require a keen understanding of their potential reach and acceptability by populations. Right now however, little is known about how willing populations are to participating in health promotion programs. Further, it is unclear to what extent populations are supportive of changes to the built and social environments that might make healthy eating and physical activity easier lifestyle choices. We propose to conduct surveys of adults living in the 21 largest urban areas in Canada in order to discover the potential reach of health promotion programs, to learn more about the acceptability of transforming local built and social environments, and to understand how potential reach and acceptability are associated with different socioeconomic and health characteristics. The survey data will be linked to geographic information about the services and amenities available in the vicinity of the survey participants' homes and workplaces. This will allow the team to better understand where to invest in unfolding health promotion programs, where to mobilize communities about healthy lifestyle issues, and what issues require advocacy on the part of public health officials. We plan extensive dissemination activities to share the information with public health officials and the public in general."
"Do HIV infected women who receive PMTCT services, in resource poor settings, experience difficulty accessing more comprehensive HIV treatment and care services?","['Gayapersad, Allison']",['N/A'],"['Antiretroviral Treatment', 'Health Systems', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Integration Of Programs And Services', 'Linking', 'Maternal', 'Newborn And Child Health Services', 'Prevention Of Mother-To-Child Transmission Of Hiv', 'Resource Limited Settings', 'Scaling Up Of Services', 'Sub-Saharan Africa']",105000.0,184745,"HIV infection rate in Nakuru, Kenya is higher at 8.3% than the national average of 5.1%. HIV incidence rate among pregnant women in Nakuru is 11% and PMTCT service coverage is 26%. In Nakuru, a resource poor setting, HIV care and treatment services have generally been developed as vertical programs with limited integration with PMTCT or existing primary health care services. Universal access to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care underline the importance of strengthened linkages between HIV intervention programs and health services. The potential benefits of programs and services linkage: improved quality of care and enhanced program effectiveness and efficiency. Using qualitative research tools the study will investigate how resource constraints, individual and household characteristics, human capacity, national agendas, and community preferences influence the feasibility of linkages between services. Effective strategies for program linkage will be developed that may guide national policies for maximum impact on reducing maternal and child morbidity and mortality from HIV/AIDS. Strong integration mechanisms for HIV intervention programs and services can contribute to significant improvement of maternal and child health. Linking PMTCT with HIV care and treatment services can facilitate identification and treatment of pregnant women eligible for highly potent ART regimens. This linkage can also provide a venue for follow-up of the HIV-exposed child, facilitating early detection and treatment of the infected infant."
Enhancing Trust and Communication in North-South Research Collaborations: A commons theoretical framework to equitable use and management of databases and biorepositories to support translational biomedical research,"['Geary, Janis D']",['N/A'],"['Bioresources', 'Collaborative Research', 'Comparative Case Study', 'Databases', 'Health Ethics', 'Law And Policy', 'North-South Research Partnerships', 'Qualitative Analysis', 'Research Commons', 'Risk Communication', 'Trust']",105000.0,229650,"Canadian biomedical researchers participate in significant international collaborations, increasingly with research partners in low- or middle-income countries.  These research partnerships produce data, materials and/or products at faster rates than ever before.  How these research outputs are managed and who has access to use them is becoming a research problem on its own.  

Countries like Canada have enough money and expertise to use research outputs easily, while developing countries often do not have the necessary resources or capacity to use the research outputs that they have helped generate.  This can lead to issues of global impact in resource sharing and collaborations, as richer countries receive more of the benefits from the research.  

This study will focus on: 1) identifying proven ways to promote communication and trust between Canada and partners in low-and middle-income countries, and 2) how to manage the sharing and use of research outputs in a fair and equitable manner.  Specific cases of biomedical research collaborations that include Canada and low-or middle-income countries and the generation of data and materials will be examined.  I will collect information from researchers, funders, policy makers, non-governmental organizations, industry and representatives from patient and community groups.  By analyzing sharing policies and collaborations from a variety of viewpoints, Canadian and international researchers will be provided with guidance on what conditions will likely lead to improved research relationships.  The overall aim of this project is to a create systems for sharing research outputs that ensure fair access, and increase the potential of biomedical research to impact the lives of Canadians and others globally."
The effects of body size on motor-vehicle collision injury and disability,"['Gee, Marianne']",['N/A'],"['Aetiology', 'Epidemiology', 'Injury', 'Motor Vehicle Collisions', 'Obesity']",105000.0,184403,"Background: Motor vehicle collisions are one of the leading causes of disability in Canada.  Obesity may put drivers at increased risk for injury and subsequent disability. Given the high prevalence of obesity in Canada, large potential impacts on public health could result from even small increases in collision injury risk associated with adiposity.

Objectives & hypotheses: The objective of the proposed research is to examine the independent and interactive effects of height and weight on risk of experiencing a motor vehicle collision-related injury, as well as the effects of obesity on recovery from these injuries. Specific hypotheses are that: 1) increased weight and short stature will be associated with increased risk of incurring a motor vehicle collision injury for both drivers and passengers; 2) air bag deployment may be the mechanism of injury for obese/overweight and short stature drivers, due to decreased distance between the driver and steering wheel; 3) obese and overweight drivers will be at increased risk of poor recovery following a motor vehicle injury. 

Data sources: Data will be obtained from the cross-sectional Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), the prospective National Population Health Survey (NPHS), and the American National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Crashworthiness Data System (CDS).  

Implications: This research addresses two key public health issues (obesity and injury) and the need to understand: non-traditional consequences of obesity, causes of injury and disability, and factors that influence recovery from injury.  Findings from this research could inform clinically-based counselling strategies as well as primary injury prevention strategies that focus on driver position and vehicle design.  Understanding the effects of adiposity on disability and recovery from injury following a motor-vehicle collision may lead to rehabilitation designed specifically for this population"

Advances in geospatial technologies, big data sciences, and availability of high-resolution, geographically referenced health and environmental quality data have created unprecedented new opportunities for spatial epidemiology to investigate environmental and other factors in explaining local and geographic variations in population health. Nowadays, public health issues become more and more complicate, dynamic, and highly heterogeneity over space, for example, people movements and spread of infectious diseases, spatial inequality of healthcare accessibility, spatial variation in diseases and socio-economic determinants, and risks from various environmental exposures. Developments in disease mapping and exposure models, integrated knowledge across multiple disciplines,  enhanced study design, and advanced methods to incorporate the time dimension, and the combination of individual-and-area-level information promise to improve our understanding for the complex relationships of environment and socioeconomics to population health."

Although the overall rate in Canada is low, it is much higher among Canadian-born Indigenous (21.5 per 100,000) and foreign-born Canadian (15.2) than Canadian-born non-Indigenous (0.6). Additionally, reactivation of the disease from untreated LTBI remains a major source of new active TB disease. Preventing TB has addressed not only social challenges but also inequalities of environmental exposures, particularly in disadvantaged population. The potential of environmental impacts on the progression of TB, including active and latent, remains unclear. Our research team attends to leverage the iPHIS, ICES, and CANUE data 1) to assess whether air pollution (PM2.5, NO2, and O3) is associated with an increased risk of activating latent TB infections; 2) to examine if air pollution increases risks of TB recurrence; 3) to estimate risks of air pollution-related mortality in individuals with active TB; and 4) to test if greenness as a modifier attenuates the effects of air pollution on the above three outcomes. Findings of this study will provide evidence to explain the associations of air pollution and greenness with TB progressions at all stages for better elucidating whom and where interventions should be targeted, which populations may be more affected by air pollution or more benefit greenness exposures, and where communities may consider reducing emissions, improving green spaces, or both to minimize the health impacts of inequalities in environmental exposures. Additionally, our study will provide a solid theoretic and methodological foundation for future studies on the mechanisms through which air pollution could affect LTBI/TB and related chronic diseases, while reducing the burden of TB diseases worldwide."
Promoting health through sustained intersectoral action: The case of ActNowBC in British Columbia,"['Geneau, Robert']","['Mitic, Wayne R']","['British Columbia', 'Chronic Disease Prevention', 'Intersectoral Action For Health', 'Population Health']",,204646,"In 2003, the Canadian province of British Columbia (BC) won the bid to host the 2010 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games. The government of the day made the achievement a window of opportunity to establish a health promotion legacy for the people in the province. To this end, it launched ActNowBC in 2005, an intersectoral initiative that integrates the actions of the whole-of-government with those of civil society to achieve health promotion targets by 2010. Four of the targets refer to risk factors that are common to several chronic diseases- tobacco use, physical inactivity, low consumption of fruits and vegetables, and being overweight or obese. The necessity of involving different sectors of government and society to reduce the chronic disease burden has been highlighted in several international reports but we still lack a solid evidence base about the required processes and success factors. In 2009, we published a case study report about the ActNowBC initiative. The report highlighted several success factors, including 1) diverse strategies and mechanisms that fostered intersectoral collaboration; 2) the presence of high-level leadership and 3) the capacity of balancing planning and action in order to move ahead even though not all the elements nor ideal conditions were in place. We concluded that the mechanisms and strategies adopted as part of ActNowBC were ""promising best practices"" that could inform other jurisdictions in the development of similar initiatives. However, the critical issue of sustainability could not be fully addressed with the initial case study given its end point. It remains to be seen if ActNowBC will deliver a health legacy beyond the 2010 Games.  The main objective of this new case study is to assess progress in the implementation of ActNowBC since 2009. There will be a special focus on coordination mechanisms and accountability structures, two key features of intersectoral initiatives that can enable or constrain sustainability."

The initiative ActNowBC provides an illustration of intersectoral action for health. The initative was launched in 2005 in order to ensure that the 2010 Vancouver Olympic Games would leave a health legacy to the population of British Columbia.

Our research project aims to contribute to a better understanding of how the health information related to the COVID-19 outbreak is delivered by authorities and media, and how it is received, understood and used by the public. To do so, we will conduct a survey about knowledge, perceptions, and reactions to the COVID-19 outbreak among large and representative samples of the population in three places: Canada, Hong Kong and Philippines. We will also analyze and compare the way information about COVID-19 outbreak is shared in the news media and the social media.

Let's Talk About Pain: Testing the Effectiveness of a Pain Assessment and Management Training Program for Respite Workers,"['Genik, Lara M']",['N/A'],"['Intellectual Disabilities', 'Pain Assessment And Management', 'Pediatric Pain', 'Pre-Post Design', 'Program Evaluation', 'Quantitative Research', 'Randomized Control Trial', 'Secondary Caregivers', 'Training Program Development']",105000.0,327923,"Background: Research has suggested that pain may be more common among children with intellectual disabilities (ID), compared to those without ID. That said, their pain is often communicated through different behaviours compared to 'typically developing' children. This can pose unique challenges for pain assessment by caregivers. Children with ID are commonly cared for by other caregivers such as respite workers (RW). There is no training program developed to provide specialized pain assessment and management information to RW. Building on my development of a research-based pain training program for RW, this work will assess the effectiveness of the program. 
     Objectives: Determine whether a pain training program for RW leads to increased: 1) pain assessment and management knowledge, and 2) RW self-confidence in pain assessment and management. 
     Methods: Participants will include adult RW employed in respite organizations who are actively providing care to children with ID and do not have any previous pain training. RW will be randomly assigned to receive the pain training immediately or at a later date following the study (wait list control group). RW will complete knowledge and confidence measures immediately before and one week after participating in a three hour interactive pain training program that will highlight topics such as pain assessment and management strategies that can be used among children with ID. RW in the wait list control group will complete the initial questionnaires on a pre-arranged date, and complete the knowledge questionnaires for the second time a week later. 
     Significance: Evaluation and further development of a pain training program designed for RW who provide care to children with ID will not only provide RW with more knowledge and care strategies, but it will also improve the overall quality of life of children with ID through enhanced care."

Psychological first aid (PFA) delivered by peers was identified as a promising approach for mitigating post-traumatic stress injuries (PTSI). A partnered pilot project assessed the feasibility of PFA in a police context, prompting SQ to pursue an organization-wide implementation starting July 2024. However, barriers to sustainability were identified: time and distance constraints hindered access to peer helpers; stigma surrounding mental health problems discouraged help-seeking; lack of knowledge on PTSI made police officers unaware of their psychological needs and; limited financial and human resources made it difficult to support peer helpers. To overcome these barriers, PeerOnCall mobile application will be introduced during the large-scale implementation of the PFA program at the SQ.

This Catalyst project aims to evaluate the feasibility of PeerOnCall as an eHealth intervention tool to increase PTSI awareness and foster peer support. The overall objectives are to co-create culturally relevant PFA content for PeerOnCall, assess the usage of PeerOnCall in randomized units of the SQ, and to assess PeerOnCall's limited efficacy on PTSI awareness and peer support seeking. 

A co-design approach following implementation science principles and relying on a mixed-method design will be used to achieve our objectives. This project will provide important, culturally relevant findings that could inform the adaptation and scaling of PeerOnCall to other francophone public safety organizations. Any identified differences relating to sex, gender, and ethnicity will provide insight into the sociocultural aspects of PeerOnCall. This project will inform the effect sizes required in sample-size calculations for a future RCT that could assess PeerOnCall's efficacy on PTSI mitigation."

These problems can continue into adulthood, with increased risk of injuries, substance abuse, obesity, and suicide attempts. Patterns of healthcare usage throughout life remain largely undocumented and are essential for planning more effective services for adults with mental health issues. Our objectives are threefold. First, to identify medical services (physical and mental health) used over the course of a lifetime by individuals who had behavioural or emotional problems as a child. This includes doctors' visits, visits to the emergency department, and hospitalizations. The second is to determine associated costs. In analyzing results, we will see if there are differences in use, costs, and patterns between men and women, stages in life, and types of  health issues. Third, a preventive intervention was set up in 1984 in schools of low-income neighbourhoods in Quebec, to help the most disruptive boys in Grades 1-2. We want to see if this program actually reduced medical visits and costs by the time the boys reach middle age (40-44 years). To accomplish these 3 goals, we will follow children who were in kindergarten in 1984 (boys) and 1987 (boys and girls), i.e. the Montreal Longitudinal Experimental Study (MLES, n=1037) and the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Kindergarten Children (QLSKC, n=5401). Students were assessed yearly by their teachers at ages 6-12. We will link data to Quebec healthcare databases. This study will be the first to describe patterns of use and costs from childhood to teenage years to young adulthood and middle age. Findings can be useful for teachers (often first-line in identifying problem behaviour; instrumental in delivering interventions); for patients, for optimal treatment; and for society, in reducing economic burden and strain on the healthcare system."

The disparity in HIV infection in Black communities is shown by the difference in those who are infected and their relative representation in the population. While Black people represent less than 3% of the Canadian population, they comprised almost 13% of new HIV positive test cases in 2006. There are many reasons why the HIV epidemic is increasing among Black populations in Canada. Black people like many other newcomers to Canada face disadvantages in employment, housing and access to healthcare. Further, for Black Canadian youth, in addition to barriers faced by their parents they also struggle with feelings of alienation due to race, social class, age and gender which hinders them from taking proactive approach towards their sexual health. These factors act in complex ways to increase their vulnerability to early pregnancy, sexual partnership dysfunctional relationship and HIV. 

Engaging communities in open and honest discussions around HIV vulnerability is an important strategy for fighting HIV stigma, reduction of social distancing and taking ownership of HIV as a threat to community. Further for youth, sexual health discussion that begins at an early age and continues throughout adolescence is critical for young people to adopt healthy sexual behaviour such as condom use. 

We are proposing a Caf√© Scientifique that aims to reach youth in particular and their caregivers, healthcare, social service providers and other stake holders to discuss some the findings, as we have learned from our research and ways of ameliorating conditions for youth."

As the pandemic continues, Canadian children, youth (hereafter, children) and their families face major economic, social and psychosocial stressors. The impact of these stressors on health and well-being will likely be unequal, disproportionately affecting families living in adverse socio-economic circumstances, as well as those with pre-existing physical, mental and neurodevelopmental conditions. The magnitude and distribution of these impacts for Canadian children and their families, however, remains largely unknown. To understand impact and inform policy responses and practice, reliable evidence collected at the population level, with comparable pre-pandemic data, is required. 

We propose to leverage the 2019 Canadian Health Survey of Children and Youth (CHSCY) - a nationally-representative sample of 26,870 children aged 1-17 years with data collected by Statistics Canada immediately prior to the pandemic - and conduct a follow-up survey with this sample in 2022, when they are 4-20 years of age. In doing so, we will: (a) examine longitudinal changes in health and functioning, before versus after the pandemic; and (b) examine the extent to which changes in health and functioning are more pronounced for specific population subgroups and communities. By documenting the scale of change in population health over time (pre- vs. post-pandemic) and by identifying sub-groups most vulnerable to ill-health, we will provide policymakers and service provides with reliable, high-quality evidence to inform resource allocation, universal and targeted intervention strategies, and mitigation strategies for future pandemic preparedness."

Indigenous children represent the fastest growing segment of the population and experience significant health inequities and a high prevalence of developmental challenges and disabilities. Early intervention therapy (EIT) programs provided by occupational therapists, physiotherapists, and speech language pathologists have been shown to be highly beneficial for young children (0-5 years) in the wider Canadian population. However, Indigenous perspectives are largely absent in EIT research and literature, and provincial government, Indigenous leaders and early childhood stakeholders are questioning why EIT programs are consistently severely under-utilized by Indigenous communities and families. There are also concerns about equitable access to EIT, particularly given that some Indigenous families 'voluntarily' place their children in state care in order to access these programs. This exploratory, qualitative study has been developed in collaboration with key stakeholders and will be inclusive of 'CIHR Guidelines for Health Research Involving Aboriginal People'. In-depth interviews will be used to generate knowledge from Indigenous parents and stakeholders' perspectives to inform EIT practices and policies that are responsive to the realities, strengths, and needs of Indigenous communities, families, and children. Knowledge translation and exchange is integral to the design of this study in order to ensure that the knowledge and recommendations arising from this research reach policy-making and EIT service provision stakeholders."

For the general Alberta population, HIV is steady in the heterosexual population and epidemic among men-who-have-sex with men (MSM).  However, for First Nations, HIV is epidemic in the heterosexual and intravenous drug user populations.  These differences mean that HIV intervention and prevention strategies targeting the general Alberta population that is at risk will not be appropriate or effective for First Nations living in Alberta.  We think that an individual's relationships with themselves, sexual partners, friends, family, and their community are influencing their decisions around drug use and sex.  Furthermore, we think that: 1) sex is being used to form attachments but then abused to access personal gain, and 2) drugs, gang lifestyle and bullying are influencing sexual partnerships, sexual activity and sexual decision making.  Our objective is to develop a community based project that will examine the connections between personal relationships, attachment to family, friends and sexual partners, drug use, gang activity, HIV and other sexually transmitted infections STIs with a First Nations community in Alberta.

We think HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are physical symptoms of physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual abuse experienced through misuse of power in relationships (e.g. residential schools, family violence).  This trauma has resulted in loss of traditional knowledge and practice on how to live the good life, a healthy life.  

The medicine wheel is a symbol of health that reminds us that we are physical, mental, emotional and spiritual beings. Clockwise movement around the wheel shows: 1) flow through the various stages of life from child to elder, 2) flow of relationships, responsibility, and knowledge between people for each stage of life (e.g. adults are opposite children because adults are responsible for children), and 3) the aspect (physical, mental, emotional, spiritual) being actively developed at a given stage of life. We believe that past, present, and inter-generational trauma has put the medicine wheel out of order, leading to disease.

We will develop a community-led HIV intervention to restore the medicine wheel.  We will test this intervention with a small group of people before bringing it to the whole community.  We need this test run so we can make sure the intervention is working properly and so we can fix any problems with its delivery.

It is vitally important to figure out how to restore the medicine wheel, and if restoring this balance will prevent HIV transmission, both for the lead community, and for other First Nations communities that share this common cause of disease.  Our project will support the creation of new knowledge that will inform the Federal Initiatives to prevent the acquisition and transmission of new infections, reduce the social and economic impact of HIV/AIDS, and contribute to the global effort to reduce the spread of HIV and mitigate the impact of the disease."

Scale matters: exploring the variability of associations between neighbourhood exposures and smoking across increasingly large spatial units,"['Ghenadenik, Adrian']",['N/A'],"['Multilevel', 'Neighbourhood Exposures', 'Smoking', 'Spatial Scale', 'Young Adults']",2398.0,331900,"Research shows neighbourhood-level inequalities in smoking prevalence. However, relatively little is known about what explains these differences. Despite the fact that young adults have the highest prevalence of smoking among all age groups and that significant smoking uptake occurs after high school, research on how features of neighbourhoods are associated with changes in smoking status in young adults is scarce. Moreover, the impact of different geographic scales on these associations has received limited attention.

This study examined associations between presence of tobacco retail outlets and smoking accommodation facilities and changes in smoking status among young adults across two different geographic definitions in Montreal, Canada. 

A significant association between presence of tobacco retail outlets at the smaller spatial unit and change in smoking status was found: the likelihood of being a non-smoker for less than 2 yrs was significantly lower in neighbourhoods with tobacco retail outlets. These findings indicate that presence of tobacco retail at a more proximal level is associated with changes in smoking status over a 2-year period above and beyond individual socio-demographic characteristics. In light of these findings, we conclude that a full understanding of neighbourhood-level inequalities in smoking requires specific examination of a range of exposures along a variety of spatial scales"

Our analyses showed that presence of pedestrian aids was significantly associated with all four outcomes. No significant associations between the other three exposures and adiposity outcomes were observed. These findings provide evidence of the potential role of built environments in shaping childhood adiposity outcomes, and suggest that targeting specific components of pedestrian aids at the neighbourhood level may help promote healthy weight-related behaviors among children."

Moreover, LGBTQ+ people are more likely to experience other discrimination-related adversity (DRA) across their life course as well as experiencing substantial structural inequities in their access to vital socioeconomic resources. Indeed, recent work indicates that LGBTQ+ people are more likely to experience food insecurity relative to their heterosexual peers. Social epigenomics studies how social experience gets ""under the skin"" to affect epigenetic processes, e.g., both heritable and non-heritable changes in the regulation of gene activity and expression that are not dependent on gene sequence, such as DNA methylation, histone modification and telomere attrition. Adversity shapes DNA methylation, thus shaping patterns of cellular regulation across multiple biological systems. These changes in gene regulation can increase risks for multiple non-communicable diseases (NCDs) (e.g., cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, diabetes). Previous research suggests that discrimination contributes to elevated NCD risk among LGBTQ+ people, but the mechanisms connecting discrimination and NCD risk are unclear. We hypothesize that exposure to DRA may become 'biologically embedded' through epigenetic changes to stress-responsive genes, thereby accelerating biological aging and altering longterm health outcomes for LGBTQ+ peoples. My research will focus on studying the epigenetic profiles from samples of LGBTQ+ youths. I aim to identify differentially methylated sites within the genome that are potentially linked to DRA. This research will advance our understanding of the impact of DRA on LGBTQ+ peoples health at a molecular level, informing evidence-based approaches to support healthy aging among LGBTQ+ people."

Yet to date there is very little research investigating the experiences of disabled boys in 'becoming men'. The proposed pilot study aims to develop a conceptual framework and methods for analysing the intersecting effects of gender, disability and generation (life stage) on the identities, health, and wellbeing of disabled young men. Methods: Participants will be twenty young men, ages 16 to 26 years old with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Over two weeks, participants will be asked to audio-record thoughts (audio-diary) and take photos (photo-voice) that reflect experiences of transitioning to adulthood, 'who they are' and representations of themselves as 'men'. The photos and recordings will form the basis for an interview exploring the men's experiences, health behaviours and needs. The data will help us to refine a conceptual framework for understanding the interaction between gender and disability and how it affects the wellbeing of young men in transition. Contribution: This study will develop procedures and methods for a larger program of research aimed at informing health policies and practices by illuminating the gendered experiences of disability for young men in transition. The pilot will provide preliminary information for promoting healthy transitions that meet the needs and identify potential risks for young disabled men.

However reasons also stem from the ongoing legacies of colonization and residential schools that have created social exclusion, structural racism, and the erasure of First Nations ways of knowing and doing from health care practices. First Nations people have not been meaningfully engaged to address their cancer care needs, and First Nations ways of knowing and doing have not been incorporated into cancer care strategies. 
The purpose of this community-based study is to understand First Nations ways of knowing and doing for improving cancer care, and to co-design an approach to address cancer care needs in two remote First Nations communities in the Yukon.
We will work in partnership with Indigenous Elders, knowledge keepers and community members in Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation, and Little Salmon/Carmacks First Nation. Our methodology will include a literature review, sharing circles, focus groups, narrative conversations, and symbol-based reflections. 
The primary outcome is a description of cancer care strategies that upholds First Nations ways of knowing-and-doing in two remote communities.  Secondary outcomes include: i) understanding the participating communities' meanings of cancer care; ii) First Nations ways of knowing-and-doing for cancer care; iii) priority cancer care needs based on First Nations ways of knowing and doing; iv) community strengths and barriers to developing and implementing the strategy; v) cultural safety of the co-designing process with the research team.

NAHSC and AHSABC work with and for Aboriginal Head Start in Urban and Northern Communities (AHSUNC) programs across the country.  AHSUNC programs are invested in being able to explore community-driven research initiatives that have the potential to directly benefit their communities, families and children. In particular, programs want to better understand how they are currently, and could further, enhance the potential of their programs to have a positive impact on children's health trajectory into adolescence and adulthood. 
The strength of this 'Healthy Beginnings' proposal is the extensive existing community networks that are integral to all AHSUNC programs. These relational networks provide an opportunity to reach and engage with diverse Indigenous community members from infants to Elders - across the lifespan and including: fathers, grandfathers, uncles, sons and brothers; mothers, grandmothers, aunties, sisters and daughters; children and youth with diverse genders and age ranges. 
The 'Healthy Beginnings' project will be guided by our NAHSC leaders from the start; keeping in line with the AHSUNC empowerment model through which local ownership and decision making are encouraged and fostered. NAHSC is well positioned to engage with local communities, families and stakeholders across Canada to inform the development of an Indigenous component of a HeLTI approach and support community reach and participation with an Indigenous-focused cohort."

A loss of skills in the labour market as older workers retire has meant the need for strategies to keep individuals working and delay retirement. Yet, not everyone enjoys good health when working. Individuals are more likely to report chronic diseases and activity limitations with age. To date, we don't have information about how characteristics of many chronic health conditions that arise with age may create unique challenges for workers, including conditions like arthritis and diabetes that do not have a continuous impact but result in episodes of disability, unpredictable symptoms, and stress related to working and disclosing health problems to colleagues. This proposal focuses on women and men 50-67 yrs of age who work with arthritis and/or diabetes compared to workers with no disabling health conditions. The research aims to: 1) Describe the extent to which remaining employed is a priority among baby boomers as they age; 2) Examine the experiences and perceived impact of working with an episodic health condition, as well as factors that act as barriers or facilitate working; and 3) Examine characteristics of episodic health conditions (e.g., symptom unpredictability, invisibility) and their association with work outcomes (e.g., job disruptions, absenteeism). A telephone-administered or on-line questionnaire will be given to a sample of individuals with arthritis (n = 500), diabetes (n = 500), and no chronic health conditions causing disability (n = 500). Questionnaires will ask for information on demographic (e.g., age, gender), health, work context, worker attitudes, and social factors. With increased life expectancies and the disappearance of mandatory retirement, Canadians are expected to age while working.

However, many Canadians live with chronic or episodic physical disabilities, such as arthritis, multiple sclerosis, colitis, diabetes, and HIV. Statistics Canada reports that 51% of people with disabilities were employed in 2006 compared to 75% of people without disabilities. Psychological processes and workplace circumstances have been identified as critical to helping people remain employed. In particular, perceived role overload in managing health and work is a key stressor related to absenteeism, reducing work hours, and work disruptions. We will examine different types of role balance/overload (e.g., time-based overload, demand-based role interplay, role strain, role facilitation) as early warning indicators of health and workplace difficulties. The research will focus on people with arthritis. Although arthritis is often thought of as a disease of aging, 3 of 5 people with arthritis are under age 65 and most of them are in their prime earning years. In fact, arthritis is the second most frequent cause of disability in the working population with about 50% of adults with arthritis disability reporting being out of work. Telephone and mailed, self-administered questionnaires will assess study objectives related to better describing role interplay, the factors associated with it, and its impact. The study will capitalize on an existing cohort of 400 individuals with inflammatory arthritis and osteoarthritis and recruit an additional 100 participants for longitudinal analyses. Participants will be assessed at 3 time-points, each 12 months apart. The proposal brings together a team from clinical, health services, and population and public health, as well as organizations focused on arthritis, work, and health.

Addressing key knowledge gaps in testing to inform STI prevention & control strategies,"['Gilbert, Mark P', 'Lavoie, Martin', 'Wong, Jason']","['Burchell, Ann N', 'Chapinal, Nuria', 'Cowieson, Ali', 'Gesink, Dionne', 'Grennan, Jonathan (Troy)', 'Grewal, Ramandip', 'Janjua, Naveed Z', 'Kling, Rakel', 'Krajden, Mel', 'Ogilvie, Gina S', 'Pederson, Ann P', 'Rose, Caren L', 'Salway, Travis', 'Samji, Hasina']","['Administrative Cohort', 'Bacterial Sexually Transmitted Infections', 'Population Data Linkage', 'Sexually Transmitted Infections Testing']",306000.0,445829,"In British Columbia (BC) and Canada, there have been dramatic increases in sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis. STIs can lead to serious health complications and have significant costs on society. Testing for STIs is important to diagnose and treat STIs, which is needed to prevent complications and spread. For this reason, increasing access to STI testing is a national priority. 

However, very little is known about testing rates and patterns. Most of our data about STIs are based on diagnoses only and do not account for testing. This is a critical gap in our STI surveillance system because increasing testing will increase STI diagnoses, but STIs may not in fact be increasing. On the flip side, there may be people who are infected with a STI but are not diagnosed because they have not tested for STI, leading to a false sense that STIs are low. Accounting for testing is needed to interpret changes in STI trends and to guide where resources for testing and other preventative measures should be prioritized. 

Few surveillance systems worldwide are able to examine how STI trends are affected by testing. BC has recently invested in public health systems that link STI diagnosis and testing data, enabling us to address this challenge. Using these systems, we can calculate STI testing rates and patterns, assess how they relate to diagnosis rates, and identify populations that may benefit from additional testing and prevention efforts. By adjusting for the impact of testing, we can then have a better understanding of trends in STIs. Our results can be used to improve surveillance systems in other jurisdictions and improve BC and Canada's response to the current STI epidemic."

"Understanding the Experiences of First Nations, M√©tis and Inuit Youth with HIV/AIDS Prevention Programs in Labrador.","['Giles, Madison L']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal Youth', 'Community-Based Research', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Labrador', 'Pre- And Post-Questionnaire', 'Prevention']",17500.0,289301,"National HIV/AIDS data indicates that Aboriginal youth are largely over-represented, addressing a need for research that is accepted and effective for this unique population. Despite these alarming signs, there is a lack of policy, programs and research that provides information as to what strategies are relevant to the experience of young Aboriginal peoples. The legacy of colonialism, structural racism, profound marginalization and the multigenerational effects of residential schools that characterize the shared history of Aboriginal peoples explain increased HIV vulnerability, thus declaring an urgent need for youth attracting, culturally appropriate, and community specific strategies. Research must be understood in the context of risk environments where many Aboriginal youth experience poverty, low education levels, lack of employment opportunities, sexual and physical violence, and street involvement, leading to a reduced ability to protect themselves from HIV risks. Stemming from this evidence and a need indicated by a community organization, the Labrador Friendship Centre (LFC), a research team was created to understand the impact of HIV prevention programs on Aboriginal youth in Labrador. Proposed data collection strategies involve delivery of a pre and post questionnaire to high school students, following a dynamic sexual health presentation, in eight communities in central and southern Labrador. This research aims to provide recommendations on specific groups within the youth population that may be in need of further support and/or programming that meets their unique needs. The LFC and other collaborating communities will be able to use the project's evaluative findings to refine HIV/AIDS programming for youth in the years to come. The incorporation of arts-based and community-engaging activities may be effective in starting community dialogue, increasing knowledge on HIV/AIDS, and improving young peoples' confidence to practice safe sexual activity."
Parent and student perceptions of a First Nation school nutrition policy,"['Gillies, Christina L']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],600.0,364876,"First Nations children have a high prevalence of obesity and obesity-related chronic diseases. School nutrition policies (SNPs) may improve the diet and health of First Nations children by guiding food and drink choices and promoting nutrition education within schools. However, the success of SNPs depends on several factors, including parent and student support of the overall policy guidelines and goals. 

A First Nation school in Alberta has implemented a SNP as a way to improve nutrition for children. This research involves the community and aims to understand the 1) students and parents' perceptions of the policy, and 2) student and parent factors acting as facilitators and barriers to its success.  

This research aims to strengthen the current SNP to reflect the perceptions of the community and minimize barriers, in turn improving children's access to healthy food choices. This knowledge will further provide recommendations for developing SNPs in First Nation schools in order to promote healthy eating and healthy weight among First Nations children in Canada."

School nutrition policies have the potential to improve the diet and health of First Nations children by guiding food and drink choices and promoting nutrition education within schools. Research concerning the unique enablers and barriers of nutrition policy implementation in First Nations schools is needed to move policy action forward. 

A First Nation school in Alberta implemented a school nutrition policy as a strategy to improve nutrition for children. This mixed-methods study aims to understand the 1) perceptions of students and parents of the policy, 2) school, student, and family factors acting as enablers and barriers to its implementation, and 3) adherence to the policy. Findings from surveys and interviews with parents and students and participant observation of the school nutrition environment will be integrated to increase the depth of understanding, and the reliability and credibility of the conclusions of the evaluation.

The outcome of this research will be a strengthening of the school nutrition policy so that it is reflective of the health perceptions and beliefs of the community; has limited barriers to implementation; and ensures that the school environment provides children with access to healthy food choices. Results will be shared with the Alberta Project Promoting active Living and healthy Eating (APPLE) Schools, which will help to define effective ways to create, support and sustain healthy First Nations, M√©tis, and Inuit APPLE Schools in Alberta. With the knowledge gained from this research, it may be possible to promote meaningful changes to the food environment within schools across Canada with a high Aboriginal population, potentially leading to a reduced prevalence of obesity and obesity-related chronic diseases in First Nations, Metis, and Inuit children in Canada."

Physical activity can provide benefits to a child's physical health and mental well-being. Unfortunately, most Canadian children do not get the recommended amount of physical activity (60 minutes on most days). As a result, researchers and policy-makers have been looking for ways to increase physical activity levels of Canadian children. The Child & Youth Network of London, Ontario and several organizational partners are introducing a program which will offer every Grade 5 child in the city a free pass to various physical activity facilities and programs throughout the City. Our project will examine whether or not this program is effective at increasing physical activity levels of children.  Our primary objective is to assess how this community-based project, which gives all Grade 5 children in London, Ontario free access to physical activity facilities and programs, can lead to increased physical activity levels. We will use a combination of approaches in this study. We will use data gathered from a series of child and parent surveys to look at how effective the intervention is at increasing physical activity levels of children while having the pass, and 4 months after the pass ends. We will also be investigating which subgroups of children (e.g., females, new immigrants, children from low income households) benefit most from receiving the Access Pass.  Understanding who benefits from the pass (and who does not), can provide researchers and community partners with information on how to develop more effective programs for improving children's health in the future. We believe this study will provide a model for future community studies."

But many Canadians have trouble accessing the type or variety of food they need to consume a healthy diet. Many policy approaches have been taken to help alleviate the problems people have with accessing healthy food, yet the problem of diet-related disease continues to rise. Smartphone 'apps' may provide a major in-road into resolving this public health
issue because of their increasing ubiquity and popularity, and because of the opportunities for using them to stage individually-targeted behavioural interventions.

Our multidisciplinary team, including several community stakeholders, therefore proposes a research project to expand and make use of an existing smartphone app and associated website to provide users with healthy food information, including: nutrition tips, recipes, and directions to healthy food sources near their current location. Our primary objective is to assess whether this app and website are effective at changing knowledge of healthy food and healthy eating behaviours among samples of youth (13-18 yrs) and their parents in selected neighbourhoods in London, ON. We will monitor progress in three ways. First, participation with the app and associated website will be tracked using web analytics software. Second,
surveys including dietary recall and food behaviour questionnaires will be administered online to all participants before and after the study intervention. Third, we will conduct experiential interviews with participants to determine the reasons for participation (or lack thereof) with the app to enhance the product for future iterations. We will especially be considering how disadvantaged population sub-groups or sub-groups at risk for health issues (e.g. diabetes or obesity) benefit from using the app. This will provide a model on how to use smartphone technology for promoting healthier diets and behaviours."

These modes include: (1) walking, biking, or rolling (e.g., scooter, skateboard, rollerblade), (2) walking to the bus stop and taking the bus, or (3) driving to a location about 5 minutes from the school and then walking. This knowledge translation tool was designed to provide young children a platform to share their perspectives of, and teach about, the benefits of AST. Engaging children between the ages of 3 and 8 years through an interactive I-Spy game can inform families leading to a to shift their behaviours towards more clean and active modes of school travel. By encouraging families to choose AST, we can (1) increase children's physical activity levels; (2) decrease the number of cars around a school, improving air quality; and (3) create healthy habits among children that will continue into adulthood."

Despite this interest, the complex issues regarding their health and wellbeing are not easily grasped through popular media.  Exacerbated by a history of pathologizing research, the lack of accurate public knowledge about gender independent children has led to confusion among health professionals, educators and parents as to whether atypical gender expression among children is to be understood as an indicator of a mental health disorder, as a precursor to gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender identity, or simply as a passing phase. This confusion has, in turn, led to inconsistent policies and practices among health and social service professionals and the persistence of systemic barriers in the lives of these children and their families.  This Caf√© Scientifique event proposes to engage the general public in a lively discussion about the most up-to-date research on this controversial topic.

Families living with less than half the low-income cut-off, and mental illness, addiction, or social isolation within the family are eligible to attend. The aim of this mixed methods study was to conduct a longitudinal follow-up of families after their children reached age 10 years, to develop an understanding of the mechanism of change. Phase I (quantitative) informed participant selection for Phase II (qualitative). In Phase II, constructivist grounded theory was used to explore experiences of 14 biological mothers as they moved through CUPS One World. The core category, Stepping Stones to Resiliency, included four categories: Perceptions of Family; Moving Forward; Achieving Goals; and Completely Different. Perceptions of Family included categories of CUPS Like Family (for recent immigrant families), and CUPS in Place of Family (for other Canadian-born and Aboriginal families). Recent immigrant mothers had experienced positive, trusting relationships with extended family, while other Canadian-born and Aboriginal mothers had experienced dysfunctional, chaotic relationships (due to abuse and neglect, addiction, and ongoing effects of colonization including residential schools). Moving Forward was linked with Perceptions of Family: recent immigrant families could step lightly onto this stone, as it encompassed adjusting to life in Canada; other Canadian-born and Aboriginal families required extra struggle in order to move on to the next stone, following years of overwhelming life circumstances. Achieving Goals required self-worth to set and work toward them; Completely Different included leaving CUPS One World with newfound Strength, Independence, Freedom, Competency, and Connection. Stepping Stones to Resiliency was not a linear process, it involved occasionally stepping backwards, sometimes slipping and falling, and most importantly, continued resolve to get back on."

I am a cancer physician with almost 10 years experience working with minority and immigrant women in Canada and in two developing countries, in order to reduce these inequities. My program of research includes several related studies: to understand causes of breast cancer in Vietnam and Bangladesh (two populations where the risk of breast cancer is rapidly increasing); to explore social and cultural factors which can prevent a woman from seeking health care if she finds a lump (in Canada and Bangladesh); and an innovative project in which community health workers- village women with special training-use our smart phone applications to conduct door-do-door interviews with women in rural Bangladesh. The first phases of this study have shown that our approach is very effective at encouraging women to come for care if they have a new breast symptom. These studies taken together can inform evidence-based policies to reduce breast cancer disparities in Canada and in low-income countries."

Despite the ongoing pace of resource development internationally, the evidence, methods and experience needed to research and respond to the relationship between expanding resource industries and health, remains limited. Canada, one of the wealthiest nations in the world, is highly dependent upon resource extraction, and provides an obvious context for examining the links among public health, ecosystem management and socio-economic development, particularly in northern, aboriginal, rural, remote and resource-dependent communities. 

This research will examine the interface between resource extraction and public health. An explicit focus will be placed on both social and environmental determinants of health and the implications for intersectoral work. This strengths based mixed methods study asks two key questions: 1. ""What is the role of the Public Health sector in addressing the health impacts of intensive resource extraction industries?"" and 2. ""What tools does Public Health currently have to address the complex interplay between socio-economic development, environmental priorities and public health in relation to intensive resource extraction industries, in particular as it relates to non-communicable diseases and human-animal-ecological health issues?"" Conducted from a base at the University of Northern British Columbia, this research will be developed in a region where public health authorities, industry, governments and communities are actively and urgently endeavouring to work together to increase understanding of the public health dynamics of intensive resource extraction and to work together toward more sustainable pathways to healthy, equitable and sustainable societies."

Ensuring this population remains healthy for as long as possible can have many positive gains for not only their individual lives and their families, but also for the health care system and economy.

From the societal perspective, with such a large portion of the population at risk of needing serious medical care in the coming years, understanding the impact that will have on the health care system and economy is necessary for long term planning. If families need flexibility at work to take days off to care for elderly parents or if more funding is needed in the health care system, those changes should be considered in the near future.

Only considering witnessed inter-parental violence, sexual and physical abuse, 32% of Canadians report EIT. Given its interpersonal nature (i.e., caused by another human), EIT may lead to dreadful effects on psycho-relational health (e.g., depression, sexual dysfunctions) that may hamper the survivors' ability to establish or maintain healthy couple relationships. However, couple relationships are the most significant relationships for a majority of adults and a healthy couple has been found to be a key determinant of health, well-being and longevity over the lifespan. Emerging adulthood is a particularly high-risk period for the development of chronic and costly psycho-relational health issues. Yet, there is scarce data on the health effects of EIT in young couples. This project aims to elucidate the links between EIT and psycho-relational health in young couples, while examining systemic effects within couples and differences across men and women. We expect that EIT will lead to increased psycho-relational health problems, but that key variables, such as partner support, will act as protection factors. A Quebec representative sample of emerging adults in a couple relationship will complete questionnaires assessing EIT, psychological (e.g., depression) and relational health (e.g., sexual dysfunctions), at baseline and one year later to examine systemic effects in couples over time. Beyond contributing to empirical and theoretical refinements, this project will generate data-driven findings to guide prevention and treatment tools targeted to EIT survivors and their partners. This project will contribute to the possibility of breaking the cycle of violence, promoting the health of EIT survivors and their couple, thus positively affecting the Canadian population."
A longitudinal dyadic investigation of the role of interpersonal trauma and couple relationships on parents' mental health and child adjustment,"['Godbout, Natacha', 'Paradis, Alison']","['Daspe, Marie-Eve', 'H√©bert, Martine', 'Herba, Catherine M']","['Child Functionning', 'Childhood Interpersonal Trauma', 'Co-Parenting', 'Couple Relationships', 'Dyadic Analyses', 'Parental Mental Health', 'Parents', 'Systemic Perspective']",625770.0,418860,"Couple relationships are described as the most significant relationship for a majority of adults, and recognized as a key determinant of mental health. The arrival of a child might be a particularly vulnerable period for parental couple relationships (e.g., conflicts, alliance), and in turn have a negative effect on both parents' mental health and their child's adjustment. An important risk factor related to the health trajectory of parental couples might be the experience of childhood interpersonal trauma (CIT; sexual abuse, neglect, etc). CIT is an endemic social problem associated with longstanding and costly mental health problems that can be exacerbated in the years following the birth of a child. Yet, the complex longitudinal associations between CIT, parental mental health and child adjustment remain unclear. Research including both partners is needed to understand how relationship factors can affect parents and their child. In this project, we will gather novel longitudinal data among parental couples to test relationship factors as the mechanism linking CIT to parental mental health and child adjustment. Both parents will complete questionnaires assessing their CIT, mental health (e.g., stress) and child adjustment (e.g., behaviors problems), at four assessments waves. Interactions among the parental couple will also be assessed using naturalistic observations. The longitudinal design will allow the examination of parental mental health and child adjustment trajectories in the years following the birth of a child, while considering relational factors from the perspectives of both parents. This study will help elucidate how CIT relates to health outcomes in victims, their partner and their child, and identify risk and protection factors, to guide the elaboration of efficient interventions aiming to enhance the health of Canadian families."
Understanding the Relationship between Employment and Health in Older Workers,"['Godin, Judith']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Employee Health', 'Employment', 'Older Workers', 'Working Conditions']",660.0,324498,"I have a background in occupational health psychology and gerontology. Through exposure to these broad areas of research, I realize that more research is needed into the health and well-being of older workers. This is especially true given the impending growth of this demographic. There is a positive relationship between being employment and good health. I am interested in examining this relationship in more detail with older workers.  Workers face a number of issues as they approach retirement age, including whether they want to retire as many older workers find meaning and enjoyment in their work. I intend to examine whether the relationship between employment and health is the same for both younger and older workers. Although there is a link between employment and health, working conditions also play a role. As people age and experience some decline in health, working conditions may play a larger role in the link between employment and health. For older workers, good working conditions may be more important in the link between health and employment. A better understanding of this link in older workers will not only benefit workers, but will help organizations keep valued employees in the workforce. In my current research, I am examining staff mix in long-term care facilities and how it impacts resident quality of life and staff work experiences. Specifically, I'm examining how different combinations of staff qualifications (e.g., regulated to unregulated workers) and staff number ( e.g., number of direct care staff per resident) impact the lives of the residents and the staff. Staff have reported on their perceptions of their work environment including the extent they feel overloaded, the clarity of their roles, job autonomy, in addition to measures of employee engagement and health. This research is providing me with a base of knowledge regarding working conditions and health, which I can use in my investigation of the well-being of older workers."
Applying systematic review search methods to the grey literature: A case study examining guidelines for school-based breakfast programs in Canada,"['Godin, Katelyn M']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1467.0,345578,"Grey literature is an important element of large-scale syntheses. However, there is no ""gold standard"" for rigorous systematic grey literature search methods and few resources on how to conduct this type of search. We developed a novel method for applying systematic review methods to grey literature and applied this method to complete a case study systematic review of grey literature that examined guidelines for school-based breakfast programs in Canada. Our grey literature search plan incorporated four different searching strategies: i) grey literature databases, ii) customized Google search engines, iii) targeted websites; and, iv) consultation with contact experts. Since abstracts are often unavailable in grey literature documents, items' abstracts, executive summaries, or table of contents (whichever was available) were screened. Screening of publications' full-text and data abstraction followed.The search strategies for identifying and screening publications for inclusion in the case study review was found to be manageable, comprehensive, and intuitive when applied in practice. The four search strategies of the grey literature search plan yielded 302 potentially relevant items for screening. Following the screening process, 15 publications that met all eligibility criteria remained and were included in the case review. This presentation describes a feasible and seemingly robust method for applying systematic search strategies to identify web-based resources in the grey literature. The search strategy we developed and tested is amenable to adaptation to identify other types of grey literature from other disciplines and answering a wide range of research questions.  Applying systematic methods to grey literature searches should improve the quality of review syntheses that include grey literature by providing a more comprehensive and less biased set of reports to examine."
Utilization of Family Physicians in the H1N1 Vaccination Programs of Canadian Provinces and Territories during the Fall 2009 Pandemic.,"['Godwin, Marshall S', 'Duke, Pauline S']","['Allison, David J', 'Asghari, Shabnam', 'Aubrey-Bassler, F.

Some individuals became very ill with the H1N1 virus during this time and all provinces experienced H1N1 related deaths. The media's portrayal of this situation combined with public health messages strongly encouraging the public to be vaccinated led to extreme line-ups at designated vaccination sites. Family physicians were, in large part, excluded from the distribution of the H1N1 vaccine in most Canadian provinces. There are several arguments for and against the use of family doctors to help distribute the H1N1 vaccine. For example, some argue that using the many thousands of existing family doctors' offices instead of rapidly established vaccination sites could have more effectively distributed the vaccine. Others argue that because family doctors don't always document well, it would be difficult to get a sense of who, and how many individuals, were actually vaccinated. This study will survey family doctors to determine their thoughts and opinions on the H1N1 vaccination program as it was delivered in their provinces; assess whether, if provided the opportunity, they would have administered the vaccine; their knowledge of the opportunity to participate in vaccine administration; and their views of the advantages and disadvantages of involving family physicians in future vaccination programs. We will also survey the medical officers of health in all of the healthcare regions across Canada (who are responsible for monitoring and reporting on the health status of people living in those regions) in order to document perceptions and policies regarding family physician involvement in the H1N1 vaccination program and why the decision was made to institute those policies."

Although multiple pH1N1 guidance documents were released by the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care to aid schools in prevention and control efforts during the 2009 pandemic influenza second wave, it is unclear to what extent these documents were useful and complied with.  

This study assesses the extent of compliance with pandemic influenza prevention and control recommendations/guidelines, for example promotion of hand hygiene and the exclusion of ill students/staff.   The study will be carried out in four southern Ontario public health units and involve 20 schools that span the public, Catholic and French-speaking boards of education.  In addition, schools will be selected based on urban vs. rural location and socio-economic and ethno-cultural characteristics.  The study will employ research methods such as document review, interviews of board of education directors, principals of the selected schools and public health staff assigned to those schools, as well as focus groups of selected teachers and parent council members at these schools.  The study will look at how initiatives known to aid prevention and control compliance in healthcare settings, e.g. senior leadership support, education on prevention and control methods and audit-feedback of the use of preventive practices, occur in educational settings.

The study will define ways to measure compliance with recommended prevention and control guidelines and determine how compliance is influenced by the factors and school characteristics noted above.  The study will focus on identifying factors that impede or limit compliance with recommended prevention and control measures, with the aim of improving products and processes to improve compliance with health in the future."
Air pollution and sentinel biologic health effects in Canada,"['Gogna, Priyanka']",['N/A'],"['Air Pollution', 'Benzene', 'Biomarkers', 'Cancer', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cohort Study', 'Nitrogen Dioxide', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Pm2.5', 'Pregnancy']",105000.0,416799,"Outdoor air pollution is associated with increased lung cancer risk based on several epidemiologic studies over the past 20 years, and was recently classified as a carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Additional studies link air pollution to other chronic diseases, as well as pregnancy related outcomes. However, the majority of these studies have been conducted in populations exposed to high levels of air pollution. Little is known about whether Canadians are exposed to levels high enough to lead to early detectable biological changes, or which specific components of outdoor air lead to these effects. The proposed study will be the first to study these relationships using a cohort of Canadian adults, as well as a vulnerable population of pregnant women who may experience higher doses of air pollution in the body due to pregnancy-related changes. 

The currently proposed epidemiology study will use a combination of satellite-based and ground monitor air pollution data to determine detailed exposure information for several components in outdoor air. Blood-samples from two national cohorts (Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow Project [CPTP] and Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals [MIREC]) will be used to assess the relationship between the different components of outdoor air and oxidative stress - an early marker of cancer, chronic diseases, as well as pregnancy outcomes. We will also take into account individuals' genetic susceptibility to these exposures in terms of their ability to detoxify chemical exposures.

Outdoor air pollution is an increasing concern, both in Canada and globally. This examination of air pollution in relation to an early marker of disease will inform on the early health effects of different air pollution components and levels, a necessary step in setting public health policy to reduce the burden of disease associated with Canadian air pollution."
Birthing Relationships and Rural Health Practices: The Experiences of Queer Women and Their Perinatal Care Providers.,"['Goldberg, Lisa S', 'Aston, Megan L']","['Burrow, Sylvia', 'Guptill, Elizabeth', 'Simmonds, Anne H']","['Diverse Populations', 'Gender/Sexuality', 'Health Equity', 'Inter-Professional Research', 'Lgbttqq Research', 'Phenomenological/Qualitative Methods', 'Provider-Consumer Relationships', 'Queer Birthing Women', 'Rural Health Care', 'Social Exclusion']",63228.0,259780,"Queer birthing women experience social exclusion in the Canadian health system based on gender and sexual orientation. Yet little research has been conducted on the experiences of these women, even less in rural care.  Homophobia, heterosexism and intolerance continue to be embedded in health care structures that are invisible and not well understood by perinatal providers. Heterosexist language and resources are especially pervasive outside of urban centers creating social and institutional conditions of exclusion. Likewise, providers often lack the necessary education to work productively with queer women during birth. Although providers often approach birthing with the intent of doing good, taking up a position of neutrality or attempting to treat everyone the same leaves providers ill equipped to account for the ways in which social conditions impact the birth experiences of queer women in rural life. 

Providers working with birthing women may unknowingly reinstate normative patterns resulting in homophobia and gender binaries. This is particularly salient in birthing contexts, where the standards of care have been heteronormatively constructed. There is an urgency to understand how perinatal practices contribute to health inequities in the lives of birthing women who are queer, in addition to the ways certain providers may challenge those patterns to maximize rural birthing care.

This phenomenological study will examine how queer women experience birth across six rural sites in Nova Scotia, and how rural providers experience their work with queer birthing women.  A total of 25-30 queer women, 15-20 nurses, 15-20 physicians, and 4-5 midwives will participate in interviews and focus groups. Findings from the study will articulate strategies for optimizing perinatal care in the context of social exclusion. The results will be useful for best practice guidelines and continuing education for providers working with queer birthing women in rural care"
"Evaluating the impacts of migration and mobility on HIV, STIs and viral hepatitis among female sex workers in British Columbia","['Goldenberg, Shira']","['Bingham, Brittany L', 'Montaner, Julio S', 'Shannon, Kate', 'Shoveller, Jeannie A', 'Smye, Victoria L', 'Strathdee, Steffanie A']","['Access To Care', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Migrant Workers', 'Migration And Mobility', 'Mixed-Methods', 'Population Health', 'Sex Workers', 'Sexually Transmitted Infections', 'Social Determinants Of Health', 'Viral Hepatitis']",,310028,"Mobility and migration are determinants of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and related infections, such as viral hepatitis, in low and middle-income countries. This is particularly true for key populations such as female sex workers (FSWs), who are disproportionately impacted by HIV/STIs and often highly mobile. Mobility may also facilitate the diffusion of infectious diseases across geographic settings and populations. However, the linkages between migration, mobility and HIV among marginalized women remain poorly understood in higher-income countries such as Canada. Despite the advances of efforts to scale-up access to care for HIV and viral hepatitis, including a program initiated in 2010 in British Columbia (BC), migrant and mobile women remain disproportionately impacted by these infections. Whereas international migrants comprise >20% of Canada's population, migrants from HIV endemic countries represent >40% of heterosexually transmitted HIV cases, and most hepatitis B and 25% of hepatitis C infections also occur among migrants from endemic countries, where access to preventive vaccines has been historically lower. Internal mobility between cities and provinces within Canada is also common, and may also relate to elevated HIV/STI vulnerability and barriers to care, especially for Aboriginal women, among whom mobility is embedded in a legacy of dispossession and displacement. This study will evaluate patterns, predictors, and impacts of migration and mobility on HIV, STIs and viral hepatitis prevention and care among a new cohort of 200 migrant and mobile FSWs (100 internal, 100 international) in Vancouver, BC. It will be the first study in Canada to explore how migration and mobility impact HIV, STIs, and viral hepatitis among FSWs over time, and will provide a research platform to inform improved policy and public health practice related to HIV, STI and viral hepatitis prevention and care."
The socio-cultural and structural context of mobility and HIV risk among female sex workers,"['Goldenberg, Shira']",['N/A'],"['Hiv/Aids', 'Migration', 'Mixed Methods', 'Population Mobility', 'Qualitative Research', 'Risk Environment', 'Sex Work', 'Sexually Transmitted Infections', 'Social Epidemiology', 'Trafficking']",150000.0,224704,"Globally and in Canada, women in the sex industry experience unacceptably high rates of HIV, sexually transmitted infections (STI), and violence. Population mobility has been implicated as a key determinant of HIV transmission in Asia and Africa; however, its role in the Americas is poorly understood. Women seeking a better livelihood often migrate to improve their economic situation. Though some intentionally migrate for sex work, many engage in sex work to meet subsistence or remittance needs, while others are trafficked. While most research suggests that mobility may increase the risk of HIV/STI infection and poses barriers to accessing health services, mobility may also offer an avenue for mitigating risk. However, few studies have explicitly studied how different forms of mobility (e.g., international migration; rural-urban mobility) may have differential impacts on HIV/STI vulnerability. This project will explore how mobility may have dynamic roles in shaping HIV risk among women in the sex trade in two distinct settings: Vancouver, BC, where the risks associated with mobility are shaped by the city's large, concentrated illicit drug scene, heavy policing, and violence; and the Mexico-Guatemala border city of Ciudad Hidalgo, Mexico, where undocumented migration, exploitation of migrants by authorities, and abuse of sex workers' rights are commonplace. This fellowship will be nested in two larger studies in Vancouver and Cd. Hidalgo.  I will use fieldwork, interviews, and statistical analyses of survey data to investigate the prevalence and context of mobility, migration, and trafficking among women and youth in the sex industry in Vancouver and Cd. Hidalgo. This fellowship will provide training in HIV prevention among vulnerable women, and will equip me with the skills and experience to emerge as an independent investigator with a focus on mobility and HIV, which is a pressing public health issue in Canada and internationally."

In 2016, the first global hepatitis targets were adopted, galvanizing this as a priority for research and action. To date, most viral hepatitis research has focused on hepatitis C (HCV) among males who inject drugs, despite evidence of potentially elevated risk of HCV among women who use non-injection drugs and women sex workers. Additionally, while rates of hepatitis B virus (HBV) in Canada are believed to be disproportionately concentrated among immigrants from HBV-endemic settings, who are greatly overrepresented within indoor sex work venues in Vancouver, little is known about HBV among immigrant sex workers. While previous research has documented many inequities facing sex workers related to HIV and other sexually transmitted and blood-born infections (STBBIs), less is known about sex workers' need for and access to viral hepatitis prevention, testing, treatment and care, particularly for marginalized sub-populations of street-based, immigrant and Indigenous sex workers.

This study will evaluate the burden and incidence of HBV/HCV, as well as barriers and facilitators to accessing prevention, treatment, and care among women sex workers in Vancouver. The study will be based on a longstanding community-based cohort and will involve (a) serological HCV and HBV testing and semi-annual questionnaires to assess incidence, prevalence, and predictors of HBV and HCV infections; (b) linkages to administrative health data in BC to characterize the HBV and HCV cascade of care; and (c) longitudinal in-depth interviews with a subset of participants to document sex workers' voices, insights and experiences with viral hepatitis services and gaps in care, including experiences with new community-led and clinical service delivery approaches. Findings generated by the proposed study will directly inform new and evidence-based viral hepatitis service delivery models for marginalized women."

Despite the large number of women who are immigrants to BC, few comprehensive studies have examined patterns of immigrant and refugee women's engagement with sexual and reproductive health services (e.g., cervical cancer screening, prenatal and postnatal care, contraception) within BC. Limited previous research with specific subgroups of immigrant women in Canada and the U.S. suggests that im/migrant women in BC and elsewhere often face structural vulnerabilities (eg, racialization, social isolation, language barriers) that may result in suboptimal sexual and reproductive health access and outcomes. While current research suggests that there is likely important heterogeneity in the usage and need for sexual and reproductive health services amongst immigrant and refugee women, few studies have comprehensively examined such issues amongst the broader population of immigrant and refugee women in BC. To address these gaps, we propose to conduct a series of prospective, in-depth interviews with recently arrived immigrant and refugee women in BC to understand their experiences and interactions with sexual and reproductive health services over arrival and settlement; we will also use large administrative health databases to longitudinally examine population-based patterns and determinants of sexual and reproductive health services use and unmet needs amongst immigrant women for the first time in BC (2009-2019). Our findings will inform current initiatives to develop BC's first Provincial Refugee Health Strategy and will inform the responsiveness of public health, clinical and community services to the realities of immigrant and refugee women in BC."

One parasite in particular, Cryptosporidium, appears to be of particular importance in Nunavut and Nunavik. This parasite has recently been found to be the dominant stool pathogen in both Nunavut and Nunavik, with relative frequencies among the highest recorded anywhere. There is also an emerging body of evidence from other regions to suggest that such enteric infections, particularly when coupled with under-nutrition, can have significant impacts on children's growth and development. In light of these recent findings and given the current lack knowledge in this field, it is now an ideal time to bring together pertinent stakeholders with the main objective of formulating a relevant research agenda and appropriate methodologies.

This study will test whether reducing SMU is an effective way to reduce feelings of anxiety, depression, and other symptoms in youth who are already experiencing emotional distress. We will also explore whether sex, gender or social comparisons influence the impact that the intervention has on emotional distress. We plan to recruit 216 youth aged 12-17 years who are on the waiting list for outpatient mental health services at a local children's hospital. Each participant will have an equal chance (like flipping a coin) of being assigned to the intervention group (108 youth) or to the control group (108 youth). The intervention group will receive an educational handout on tips for reducing SMU and will be required to limit SMU to 1-hour per day. Participants in the control group will receive the same educational handout but will have no limits put on their SMU. All participants will monitor their SMU daily on their smartphones and send us screenshots of their daily use. We will measure participants' symptoms of emotional distress using questionnaires that will be completed before the program, after 4 weeks of intervention, and again after 8 and 12-weeks to see if youth in the intervention group show greater reductions in emotional distress compared to those in the control group. This study may be the first to show that reducing SMU is an effective way to reduce emotional distress in a vulnerable group of youth waiting for mental health services. If this study is successful, findings would suggest that reducing SMU should be included in the treatment of distressed youth."

We will collect five additional years of follow-up data to examine changes over time in fracture rates in women and men (particularly hip and back fractures) as well as changes over time in the major risk factors for fractures (such as bone mineral density, and serum vitamin D levels). We will evaluate the effectiveness of therapy on the prevention of first and subsequent fractures, the long-term effectiveness of therapy, the factors predisposing to loss of effectiveness of therapy, and how therapy impacts on quality of life. We will also examine  the quality of life of participants who have a diagnosis of osteoporosis but have not yet fractured and in those with osteoporotic fractures.
Annual follow-up will continue through the period of this grant, with complete reassessment of the participants once during the study. This will include an interviewer-administered questionnaire; measurements of height, weight, bone densitometry; spine x-rays; and blood samples. Participants who report a fracture on the annual mailed follow-up questionnaire will complete a telephone interview on fracture and health-related quality of life.

A healthy mouth that enables smiling, speaking, eating and chewing without limitation or discomfort is key to social participation and psychosocial well-being. We know that being able to see a dental professional is essential for good oral health and that it may indirectly influence psychosocial well-being as it enables one to maintain and restore basic functions of the mouth. However, whether enhancing access to dental care can contribute to changes in psychosocial well-being from middle age through older age, and whether oral health can be an intermediary factor in these relationships is unknown. Issues of access to dental care, at both the individual (e.g., dental insurance status, frequency of dental service use) and area levels (e.g., availability of dentists in a geographical area) continues to be a public health problem in Canada, with at least one in every five Canadians being unable to see a dentist. Such challenges have led the Federal Government to announce the Canada Dental Care Plan (CDCP) (to be expanded to seniors by 2025) and the Oral Health Access Funds in its 2023 budget. While these initiatives aim to address financial and non-financial barriers to access to dental care, they raise important questions on the ""return on investment"". Thus, it is timely to investigate the longitudinal impact of the lack of access to dental care on psychosocial well-being of our aging population and to identify who may be in most need of this care, with the ultimate goal of informing targeted interventions."
Understanding Opioid Use and Harms among First Nations People in Ontario: Integrating Administrative Data with Guidance from Communities,"['Gomes, Tara', 'deGonzague, Bernadette']","['Antoniou, Tony', 'Bertram, Jonathan R', 'Macdonald, Kathryn J', 'Martins, Diana', 'McGregor, Lorrilee', 'Mecredy, Graham C']","['First Nations', 'Mental Health And Addictions']",1158976.0,433597,"Harms related to opioid use have had devastating and long-lasting impacts on First Nations communities in Ontario, Canada. Yet, information on factors that contribute to these harms is limited and poses a critical barrier for communities who are working to identify evidence-based public health responses. Recent research led by the Chiefs of Ontario (COO) in collaboration with ICES and the Ontario Drug Policy Research Network (ODPRN) found that rates of opioid-related hospitalizations and deaths were up to four times higher among First Nations relative to non-First Nations in Ontario. From this work, the Opioid Surveillance Steering Committee, led by COO and comprised of First Nations community members and Elders, identified several essential research questions to better understand this health crisis.

This research program will use databases at ICES to characterize the real-world patterns of opioid use and related harm, pathways of healthcare use, and treatment outcomes among First Nations people broadly, and in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, it will bring together community and research expertise through joint leadership by COO and the ODPRN. This will also support meaningful community engagement, direct liaisons between the research team and communities, and broad dissemination of research products tailored to various stakeholders at the community and policy-level.

Rates of opioid-related harm in Ontario are among the highest in the country and First Nations people are disproportionately experiencing these effects. This program of research will provide First Nations communities with an understanding of the current state of the opioid crisis in their communities, how this is being impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and will identify opportunities for an evidence-based approach to public health and policy development with broad implications across Canada."

In psychiatry, screening for symptoms or evaluating recovery is often done using self-questionnaires. The patient is expected to respond to questions about how often  certain . However, Indigenous views of well-being may not fit with this approach. Although the Growth and Empowerment Measure-GEM was originally developed in Australia, the Inuit and Mohawk we have been able to speak with have indicated that the GEM measures critical aspects of their well-being more respectfully and accurately than currently used measures focused on symptoms. Our goal is to introduce the GEM to indigenous populations in northern Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia to identify how and if we should further approach this research. We aim to form an advisory group of interested individuals comprised of Indigenous community members of all positions and genders, with hope to significantly include two-spirit individuals. Although we discuss the GEM, we will be encouraging other proposals from community members. We will consider the interconnection between the  well-being of individuals, their geographical location, families and communities, the link with language, the land and ancestors, as well as traditional approaches to healing. We will use a mix of qualitative research methods; Community Based Participatory Research and Participatory Action Research to assess the acceptability, viability, and utility of the project. We aim to increase knowledge on the factors that inhibit or facilitate cultural safety in psychiatric measurement, psycho-education and interventions. Our desire is to improve communication between the cultural perspective of the patient and the biomedical view of health care personnel. This research recognizes community protocols and the holistic approach to health in Indigenous culture. We respect the principles of OCAP during all the steps of the project."

We propose to hold three virtual meetings, with each meeting building on the content of the previous one. These meetings will be moderated by a certified professional facilitator who is not a member of the study team. 

Meeting # 1 - Setting the Stage: The participants will: 1) discuss the current needs and gaps in this field of research and 2) identify opportunities.  Needs, gaps, and opportunities will be collated and shared with all study participants prior to the next meeting.

Meeting #2 - Ranking of Priorities.  Participants will rank the research opportunities identified in the first meeting into top priority research areas. Participants will be divided into breakout rooms to foster additional multidisciplinary discussions. In each breakout room, the participants will agree on their top three priorities based on need and feasibility. Each small group will then present their top three areas along with a rationale for their choices to the full group. Low feasibility high need projects will also be discussed. 

Meeting # 3 - Develop a plan to support how top research priorities may be operationalized. Will discuss data sources and methodological approaches, strategies to mitigate limitations, knowledge translation strategies, and potential impact. 

These meetings will be the starting point for the development of The Pan-Canadian research collaborative for firearm violence prevention and will act as a catalyst for CIHR project grants that address the top research priority areas identified for the prevention of firearm injuries in Canada."
"A critical discourse analysis of Twitter posts regarding the meanings Canadians ascribe to cardiovascular disease (CVD), health identities, and health-related behaviours.","['Gonsalves, Christine']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,387967,"Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality among Canadian women, with women of Indigenous, South Asian, and lower socio-economic backgrounds at greater risk. In order to drive public awareness of CVD risk, the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada launched their re-branding campaign in November 2016 with the Twitter hashtag #MoreMoments. The aim of this study was to investigate what ""more moments"" meant to Canadians; in particular, health behavior implications of disease prevention and implications for gendered identities of those at CVD risk.
Methods: Twitter data with ""#MoreMoments"" was analyzed from September 1, 2017 to November 30, 2017 (136 Tweets and Quote Tweets, 351 Re-Tweets, 227 images, 18 videos, 2 GIFs, 46 external links, and 36 replies to external link messages). A critical discourse analysis methodology was chosen to guide data collection and analysis to identify the discourses (patterned perceptions and ways of thinking) and identities for CVD prevention.  
Results: Meanings constructed by Twitter users surrounding CVD were identified within two discourses; a discourse of tragedy and loss, and a discourse of life and health. These discourses further constructed gendered identities for visionary leaders, selfless humanitarians, and successful survivors. Twitter users constructed cardiovascular functioning through risk reduction within one's means such as walking, as well as dependence on medical institutional control to create meanings for what it meant to be alive and in good cardiovascular health. Health behaviours were tied to gendered relationships with family members such as maternal caregiving, recreational activities of preference, and innovative medical advances. The results revealed beneficial and problematic identities for risk reduction for those at CVD risk, with implications for improving current public health promotion. For example, inclusion of diversity of women's social roles and racial backgrounds."

Although parenting interventions are broadly available, the theoretical foundations, format, and delivery often differ greatly amongst different types of programs. In Ontario there are two group-based parenting programs that are widely used: the Circle of Security Parenting program and the Triple P Positive Parenting Program. In 2019, we launched the Promoting Healthy Families study to evaluate both programs with the overall goal to provide evidence about the implementation and effectiveness of the two programs on parenting practices and child socioemotional outcomes. Multiple activities were carried out including Health Equity Impact Assessments, a three-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT); process and economic evaluations were also embedded within the RCT to examine effectiveness of the programs, program implementation (what works for whom and why) and cost effectiveness. 

To disseminate evaluation findings, we are proposing a one-day knowledge translation summit with key stakeholders. We are leveraging this unique opportunity to facilitate broader discussions with our community and policy partners regarding critical service delivery issues including engaging equity-deserving families in services, the sustainability and scale up of the parenting programs, as well as a discussion on implementation in real-world settings. The knowledge transfer between research and practice at this event will be critical to helping improve child mental health, help foster equitable access of services for all families, and enhance care and reduce health system costs. In addition, policy makers can use this information to set priorities about resource allocation for evidenced-based parenting programs across Ontario."
"Air pollution as a modulator of molecular, structural, and clinical outcomes in patients with fibrotic interstitial lung disease.","['Goobie, Gillian C']",['N/A'],"['Air Pollution', 'Environmental Health', 'Epigenetics', 'Gene Expression', 'Interstitial Lung Disease', 'Ultra-Resolution Imaging']",135000.0,454464,"Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) are serious conditions that result in scarring of the lungs, breathing difficulties, and often a severely shortened lifespan. Recent evidence suggests that air pollution may contribute to the development and progression of ILD, but we do not understand how pollutants exert these effects. 

This project will investigate how a patient's genetics influence their responses to air pollution, how pollution alters which genes are turned on or off in the lungs, how the small airways of the lungs are impacted, and how these changes impact disease progression. We will start by evaluating how specific genes known to be associated with ILD impact how an individual will respond to air pollution exposure. Next, we will look at molecular patterns on DNA that regulate which genes are turned on or off (i.e. epigenetics) and the amount of a gene that is being used to make protein products (i.e. their gene expression levels) that are found in the blood and lungs of patients with ILD. Through this process, we aim to identify molecular signatures that can tell us about a patient's pollution exposures and their risk of ILD progression. Lastly, we will perform micro-scale imaging of lung tissues donated from patients with ILD to better understand how the small airways and alveoli of the lungs change in response to pollution exposure and as the disease progresses. 

This research will provide us with a more thorough understanding of the impact of air pollution on the lungs on a molecular and structural level, allowing us to learn how to minimize future damage and progressive scarring. In studying which genes are turned on and off in the lungs in response to environmental exposures, we may also identify new pathways for the development of medications to minimize or reverse lung scarring. This research will inform environmental health policies aimed at protecting vulnerable populations, including patients with ILD and other chronic lung diseases."
"Addressing rising Canadian radon gas-induced lung cancer risk due to COVID-19 pandemic-linked lung injury, disability, and behaviour change","['Goodarzi, Aaron']","['Peters, Cheryl E']","['Behaviour Change', 'Built Environment', 'Covid-19', 'Disability', 'Healthy Cities', 'Lung Cancer', 'Lung Injury', 'Radiation Dosimetry', 'Radon Gas', 'Telecommuting']",455834.0,460291,"Our goal is to understand and address rising radon gas-induced lung cancer risks due to COVID-19 pandemic-linked lung injury, disability, and behaviour change. 1 in 5 lung cancers arise in Canadians who have never smoked, with ~110,000 cases since 2001. A previous lung disease history is directly associated with increased lung cancer risk in never-smokers, making them more vulnerable to triggers. The most common lung cancer trigger in never-smokers is repetitive inhalation of radioactive radon gas, a prevalent carcinogen in the Canadian residential environment that emits highly mutagenic particle radiation.

The amount of life spent 'at home' correlates with radon exposure, modifying lung cancer risk as a function of our behaviour and built environment. Young people and the 6 million Canadians living with disability were, even before the pandemic, exposed to more radon due to biases in how they are able access housing stock. Today, fully 1 in 5 people hospitalized with COVID-19 are returning to their lives with a new disability, as lung and heart injury increases prevalence of debilitating fatigue, cognitive impairment, and reduced mobility; collectively, these alter employment prospects, behaviour, and time spent at home. For others, COVID-19-related behaviour changes such as heightened demand for long term telecommuting is changing radon exposure, with a 20% increase in particle radiation dose to lungs recorded for 18-45 year-olds so far.

In this project, we will (1) measure radon exposure of Canadians experiencing COVID-19-induced disability and/or behaviour change, as a function of personal demographics, employment sector, job profile and across the built environment; (2) estimate radon-induced lung cancer burdens and costs in a pandemic-modified future with/without intervention for impacted groups; and (3) develop, for the first time, radon reduction resources for those living with disability, with a focus on COVID-19 survivors and promoting healthier cities."

In many such communities, people worry about the link between H. pylori and stomach cancer, a cancer that occurs more frequently in this region than on average across Canada. Physicians in the north view this infection as a major problem because it is found in many patients with common stomach complaints and standard treatment is often ineffective in this setting. Health authorities have identified the need for research aimed at developing H. pylori control strategies appropriate for the north. The proposed research seeks to generate knowledge about how health care decision makers can effectively manage H. pylori infection in a manner that addresses community concerns. To begin working toward these goals, the applicants formed the Canadian North Helicobacter pylori (CANHelp) Working Group, a collaborative team that links the University of Alberta with northern health authorities and community organizations. While the research goals require data from multiple northern settings, the team conducted a pilot project as a starting point in Aklavik, NWT, where they found that 58% of 313 participants had H. pylori infection, and among those infected, there was a high prevalence of precancerous stomach conditions. The objectives of the current proposal, developed at the request of the Inuvialuit Regional Corporation, are to: 1) Expand the research to additional communities in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region to obtain representative data for informing regional public health strategies pertaining to H. pylori infection; 2) Identify cost-effective H. pylori management strategies for northern communities; 3) Create knowledge exchange strategies to help community members understand H. pylori health risks and currently available solutions."

Considerable proportions of Canadians report using nutritional labels on pre-packaged food and use of the labels is associated with healthier diets. However, evidence suggests that many consumers underestimate the caloric content of restaurant meals. The proposed research will examine the impact of providing nutritional information on fast-food menus. Participants will be invited to participate in a study unrelated to nutrition and will be offered free lunch as compensation.  Participants will be randomly assigned to view menus corresponding to one of four experimental menu conditions: 1) a conventional menu without nutritional information (control condition); 2) a menu listing the caloric content of food items; 3) caloric content plus Recommended Daily Intake amounts; and 4)caloric content presented using Traffic Light symbols. After choosing their meal, subjects will complete a task unrelated to nutrition. Participants will then be given their free meal. Analyses will examine meal choice, as well as quantity eaten and an estimate of caloric intake as a function of menu condition to address three primary research questions: 1) To what extent is food choice and food consumption affected by the presence of nutritional information on menus? 2) What is the impact of supplementing quantitative nutritional information with colour rating systems? 3) To what extent is the effectiveness of nutritional labelling on menus moderated by socio-demographic factors, including socioeconomic status and education level? This study has the potential to support proposed policies such as Bill 156; the Healthy Decisions for Healthy Eating Act, which would require caloric content to be listed on menu boards in fast-food chains. This research has the potential to improve public health by allowing consumers to make more educated decisions when purchasing meals outside the home."

In British Columbia, Canada, these hardships are intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic, the local housing affordability crisis, and the overdose public health emergency. This project will bring together researchers, community organizations, 2SLGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness, and others to create new and much-needed partnerships in this area. As a group, we will work to better understand and prevent homelessness among 2SLGBTQ+ youth, while also sharing ideas about how we can tailor policies and programs to support youth who are currently homeless. We will do this through three main activities. First, we will look to the research literature to see what it says about the health and social needs of 2SLGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness, and to gather early ideas about how we can best go about doing research with this group. Second, we will host a set of province-wide meetings with key stakeholders, aiming to share knowledge and develop collaborations through which to promote the health of 2SLGBTQ+ youth experiencing homelessness. These meetings will also inform our third project activity, in which we will develop a proposal for a future, larger-scale research project with this priority group of young people. Ultimately, this project will pave the way for developing and actioning a research collaboration to better understand, prevent, and mitigate the impacts of homelessness among 2SLGBTQ+ youth in British Columbia."
Investigating the Moderating effect of Prenatal Stress on Serotonin Transporter Polymorphism 5-HTTLPR in Predicting Negative Emotionality,"['Gordon Green, Cathryn H']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,269167,"As the infant temperamental trait negative emotionality (NE) has been frequently linked to childhood anxiety and depression, understanding its biological and environmental origins will help to better understand how these disorders develop. Maternal stress is one potential environmental factor that, when experienced by the developing fetus during pregnancy, has been found to increase susceptibility to adversity later in life.  In some cases prenatal maternal stress has been found to interact with 5-HTTLPR, a vulnerability gene, such that infants who are carriers of a specific genetic variant of the 5-HTTLPR genotype have experienced an increase in susceptibility to adverse behavioural outcomes only when exposed to stress during the prenatal period. The present investigation examined if this link might predict behaviour patterns of NE in infants between 3 and 36 months of age. In addition, as development is continuous during pregnancy, we also examined whether stress exposure during trimester 2 and/or trimester 3 would differentially affect NE in infancy. Our analysis revealed that both anxiety and depression experienced during the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy predicted maternal ratings of NE at 3 months of age only in infants who were carriers of the vulnerability genetic variant in 5-HTTLPR. These results suggest the importance of stress prevention during pregnancy and that  prenatal stress experienced as early as the second trimester can have behavioural effects. Since the interaction effect was no longer significant at 18 and 36 months, one wonders about other environmental factors, such as postnatal maternal depression, as they may be involved in the development of infant NE after 6 months of age."

Socially Useful Behaviours and Self-Concept among Older Adults: Measure Development & Preliminary Validation,"['Gottlieb, Benjamin H']","['Sevigny, Andr√©e']","['Aging', 'Longevity', 'Measurement', 'Morale', 'Social Usefulness', 'Validation']",47622.0,203059,"For seniors, one avenue to healthy aging is to engage in socially meaningful relationships and activities such as
volunteering. The protective effects of social engagement may be especially pronounced among seniors because of their
natural tendency to focus on emotionally satisfying relationships. However, to date, there is no clear understanding of how
and why certain kinds of social engagement are protective. The purpose of this study is to examine the novel and relatively
undeveloped concept of self-perceived social usefulness, one type of personal resource seniors may draw on that has the
potential to benefit their health and well-being. The goals of the research are twofold (1) to assess older adults' (60+) socially
useful activities, roles, relationships, and self-concept; and (2) to examine the associations between a new measure of social
usefulness and related measures. This research is important because it promises to identify a personal resource that may
play a role in older adults' health and well-being. For policy makers and practitioners, this research is a first step in
developing a tool to assess behaviours and a self-concept that may predict life satisfaction and longevity."
"Intestinal microbiota and child health: Does supplemental feeding, improved environmental hygiene and sanitation in resource limited settings improve child growth by restoring the composition of microbes in the human intestine and preserving the intestinal barrier?","['Gough, Ethan K']",['N/A'],"['Child Growth', 'Infant Health', 'Intestinal Microbiota', 'Tropical Enteropathy']",150000.0,217928,"Background: Early childhood under nutrition significantly reduces child growth, resulting in poor mental and physical development, and causes about one-third of under-5-year mortality worldwide. Supplementary feeding and sanitation/hygiene interventions only reduce impaired growth by 30% and 2.4%, respectively.  Tropical enteropathy (TE) is another potential contributor. In TE, the small bowel surface area decreases and the gut wall becomes 'leaky', allowing microbes to enter the bloodstream. In addition to decreasing nutrient absorption, these changes may result in chronic immune activation, which may impair child growth by diverting resources needed for growth to immune stimulation. The assembly and composition of intestinal microbiota (micro-organisms that live normally in the intestine) is thought to be critical to the development of TE and to growth.
Methods: We will test the hypothesis that poor child growth is the result of: altered intestinal microbiota, development of TE, decreased nutrient absorption, a 'leaky gut', and growth-suppressing immune stress. We will test this in the context of the ZVITAMBO trial. ZVITAMBO is a cluster-randomized trial of 2,800 non-HIV-exposed infants in Zimbabwe. It aims to determine whether TE is prevented in infants by household sanitation, complementary feeding, or both. Fecal and blood samples will be collected from a random subsample of 600 infants at 3, 6, 12, and 18 months. To test the causal pathway, changes to the microbiota will be characterized from stool specimens using DNA sequencing methods. Biological markers of immune response (calprotectin in feces) and intestinal microbes in the blood (serum endotoxin) will also be measured. A 'leaky' gut will be defined by measures of intestinal permeability and absorptive capacity of the bowel. A more meaningful understanding of the causal pathway leading to growth impairment in infants may have profound implications for improving child health and quality of life worldwide."
Psychosocial and physiological predictors of chronic inflammation among individuals exposed to chronic stress,"['Gouin, Jean-Philippe']","['Barker, Erin T', 'Booij, Linda', 'McGrath, Jennifer J', 'Wrosch, Carsten']","['Chronic Stress', 'Coping', 'Cortisol', 'Daily Stress', 'Glucocorticoid Sensitivity', 'Heart Rate Variability', 'Inflammation', 'Predictors', 'Psychoneuroimmunology', 'Social Support']",473302.0,293223,"Chronic stress is associated with increased risk for poor health. However, some people can handle stress well, while others are more vulnerable to the negative impact of stress on health. Although most people will show some adaptation to stress over time, some individuals will exhibit ongoing difficulties in response to chronic stress. One way that stress gets under the skin to impact health is by creating an over-production of inflammatory proteins. There is thus a need to study the risk and protective factors for chronic inflammation when individuals are exposed to stress over several years. This information will help us identify individuals at greater risk for poor health. To accomplish this, we will follow parents of children with developmental disabilities given that they are experiencing daily stress and parenting challenges over several years. We will follow parents as their adult child is exiting high school because this transition period is associated with frequent and repeated stressors typical of most situations of chronic stress. Three times over a period of 24 months during their child's transition out of high school, parents will provide information on the stress that they experience, their psychological response to stress, and their social support. At the baseline, 12-month, and 24-month visits, parents will provide saliva samples to assess stress hormones production, wear a portable electrocardiogram to monitor their heart rate, and provide blood samples for the analysis of their blood levels of inflammatory proteins. These data will allow us to examine which psychological and physiological factors predict chronic inflammation among these parents exposed to chronic stress for several years. This study will help us identify stressed individuals who are the most vulnerable to poor health. In the context of limited health care resources, these data will help us provide preventive interventions to individuals who need it the most."
The role of chronic stress and sleep reactivity in the persistence of insomnia over time.,"['Gouin, Jean-Philippe']","['Dang-Vu, Thien Thanh', 'McGrath, Jennifer J', 'Savard, Jos√©e']","['Insomnia', 'Stress']",669375.0,388323,"While many individuals experience transient sleep disturbances, about 9% of the Canadian population suffers from chronic insomnia. Although stress is recognized as a common cause for the onset of insomnia, the role of chronic stress in the maintenance of insomnia over time is less well understood. One reason is that there are individual differences in stress reactivity; that is, some people experience stronger bodily responses to stress than others. This means that some individuals are more vulnerable to experience insomnia in response to stress than others. Furthermore, most of the past studies have not examined the types of stressors that are chronic in nature. Moreover, some studies suggest that not only can stress lead to poor sleep, but poor sleep is also associated with increased stress. To better understand the role of chronic stress in insomnia, we will follow a group of insomniacs who will receive a psychological treatment for insomnia. At the beginning of the study, insomniacs will complete assessments of chronic stress, stress reactivity, and current insomnia symptoms. Then, the participants will be assigned to either a cognitive-behavioural therapy for insomnia or to a waiting period. Changes in insomnia and chronic stress will be assessed after treatment as well as 12 months later. This study will allow us to examine whether chronic stress is related to changes in insomnia over time, whether insomnia treatment reduces chronic stress, and whether individuals with high stress reactivity are more susceptible to the impact of chronic stress on sleep. Our overall goal is to identify a subgroup of insomniacs more susceptible to the impact of chronic stress on insomnia that may benefit from treatment targeting stress reactivity."
Refining Heat-Health Policy in Canada's Heat Alert and Response Systems to Increase Heat Resiliency in Vulnerable Populations,"['Goulet, Nicholas']",['N/A'],"['Climate Change', 'Emergency Preparedness', 'Extreme Heat Event', 'Global Warming', 'Health Policy', 'Health Systems & Services', 'Heat Action Plan', 'Heat And Health Protection', 'Heat Mitigation And Management', 'Heat Stress']",35000.0,484597,"More intense and frequent extreme heat events mean that Canada is entering unchartered territory as it regularly experiences record-high temperatures, negatively affecting the health of Canadian men and women. As evidenced by the deadly extreme heat event of 2021 that claimed the lives of 619 Canadians in British Columbia, extreme heat is a silent killer as it is not seen or heard. To safeguard Canadians, Health Canada developed the Heat Alert and Response Systems (HARS), providing an overview of heat-health risks and evidence-based strategies for alerting health authorities and the public when hazardous conditions arise. However, the current HARS employs a one-size-fits-all approach and does not consider individual variability in physiological tolerance to heat stress, as shown by the wealth of data generated by the Human and Environmental Physiology Research Unit (HEPRU). This leaves many heat-vulnerable Canadians under-protected, such as women and older adults. In partnership with the Climate Change and Innovation Bureau (CCIB) division of Health Canada and the HEPRU, this project aims to identify areas for refinements in the development and implementation of HARS, ensuring equitable protection to all Canadians. To reach this objective, the project seeks to achieve the following objectives: i) synthesize best practices related to heat-protective mitigation to identify limitations in heat alert action plan guidance, ii) perform a wide scan of current public heat alert action plans to assess the variability in heat-health awareness and preparedness, as well as heat management strategies across Canada, and iii) develop a framework for extreme heat guidance tailored to protect the health of Canadians by layering heat alert action plans according to various demographic factors known to influence health risks posed by extreme heat, such as sex and age. This project is an important step in safeguarding the health and well-being of Canadians during extreme heat events."
"Understanding the Significance of ""Becoming Undetectable"": Longitudinal Narratives of Gay Men's Sex Lives after Being Diagnosed with HIV","['Grace, Daniel']",['N/A'],"['Acute Hiv Infection', 'Gay And Bisexual Men', 'Health Literacy', 'Health Services', 'Hiv Prevention', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Mixed Methods Research', 'New Diagnostic Technologies', 'Viral Load']",2500.0,324301,"Much longitudinal research on the sex lives of HIV-positive gay men has focused upon following behavioural trends quantitatively and emphasizing the different risk-reduction strategies men use (or do not use) to reduce onward transmission. To critically extend this literature, we explore gay men's sex life narratives following their diagnosis with an acute or recent HIV infection. All participants received an acute (n=13) or recent (n=12) HIV diagnosis and completed a series of self administered questionnaires and in-depth qualitative interviews over a one-year period or longer. Over the course of four qualitative interviews, participants frequently spoke of the role of medications (e.g., decisions to start treatment) and changing viral loads (e.g., discourses of becoming ""undetectable"") in relation to their sex lives since being diagnosed with HIV. Many men talked about milestones relating to initiating medication and viral load as informing their shifting sexual behaviors and identities as HIV-positive - or ""undetectable"" - gay men. The narratives of our participants provide insight regarding complex negotiations and processes of decision-making over time related to sex, counseling needs, treatment initiation, viral load and the significance of ""undetectability"" as an emergent identity."

This context of inequity creates heightened vulnerabilities to COVID-19. Failure to respond to the health and wellness needs of GBM may have significant negative effects on COVID-19 outcomes and exacerbate existing health disparities. We propose the Engage-COVID-19 Study to rapidly respond to current and pressing knowledge gaps concerning the COVID-19 pandemic among GBM in Canada. This study will be embedded within the Engage Cohort Study, which is the only study with comparable biobehavioural data on HIV/STI prevalence and risk behaviours for GBM in Canada. 

To date, baseline data collection has been completed with 1842 GBM who are enrolled in the Engage Cohort Study (565 in Vancouver, 388 in Toronto, and 889 in Montreal). All of these participants will be invited to have SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing and complete an in-depth survey that will include COVID-specific quantitative questions. We anticipate recruiting a total sample of 1695-1768 participants. In addition, from this group we will recruit 90 GBM participants for qualitative interviews in Vancouver (30), Toronto (30), and Montreal (30) to assess the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 on Canadian GBM. These data are necessary both to understand COVID-19 risks, vulnerabilities, and prevention strategies, as well as the impacts of COVID-19 on health service access and different levels of HIV/STI risk across provinces. By making efficient use of available research infrastructure, our proposed study will ascertain the occurrence of COVID-19 by documenting SARS-CoV-2 immunity within both HIV-positive and -negative participants and produce rapid, high-quality evidence for preventing the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 for this population across multiple jurisdictions."

These disparities stem from experiences of stigma and discrimination. Despite these inequalities, research also highlights the strengths and resilience of members of older LGB communities. This research will explore cognition and mental health in older LGB people and examine the protective role of resilience factors, such as social support and cognitive reserve. By exploring the risks and resources in this population, this research will lay the groundwork for a comprehensive understanding of the ongoing experiences of LGB older adults, helping to ensure equitable care."
"Depressive symptoms, prediabetes, and incident diabetes in an English community sample","['Graham, Eva']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2500.0,347137,"Type 2 diabetes is a prevalent chronic condition that is increasing worldwide. Approximately 7% of Canadian adults have Type 2 diabetes and this number is expected to increase due to aging and lifestyle changes. Both depression and prediabetes, or elevated glucose levels, increase the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. However, the implications of having both depression and prediabetes are unclear. In particular, the risk of Type 2 diabetes due to depression may differ in people with prediabetes and normal glucose levels.  The aim of this research was therefore to assess how having low, moderate, or high depressive symptoms is associated with the diabetes development in adults with prediabetes compared to adults with normal glucose levels. Depressive symptoms and the presence of prediabetes were assessed in 4129 older adults in England in 2002-2003. Participants were then followed for an average of 6.7 years to determine whether they were newly diagnosed with diabetes. Consistent with previous research, results indicated that high depressive symptoms were associated with diabetes development in adults with and without prediabetes. This study also contributed the novel finding that moderate and high depressive symptoms may be associated with a higher risk of diabetes in older adults with prediabetes compared to those with normal glucose levels. From a public health perspective, these results suggest that it may be important to assess and intervene on depressive symptoms in people with prediabetes to aid in the prevention of Type 2 diabetes."
Depression and the Onset of Type 2 Diabetes: The Role of Metabolic and Lifestyle Factors,"['Graham, Eva']",['N/A'],"['Depression', 'Diabetes', 'Health Behaviours', 'Lifestyle', 'Metabolic Factors']",105000.0,348006,"Introduction: Research indicates that depression increases the risk of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D). Canadian rates of T2D are rising and depression is widespread.  While not all people with depression will not develop T2D, those with specific characteristics appear to be at higher risk for T2D. Studies show that people with 1) metabolic conditions (ex. high blood sugar levels) and 2) less healthy lifestyle behaviours (ex. little exercise) have a greater chance of developing T2D.  
However, it is not clear how these factors combine to affect the risk of T2D.  Also, it is not certain whether the risk of T2D is higher for people with depression and metabolic conditions because they have less healthy lifestyles related to depression.  
Aims: 
1.To examine how the risk of T2D related to depression differs in people with 1) metabolic conditions 2) lifestyle characteristics and 3) combinations of these factors.
2.To assess whether changes in lifestyle behaviours explain the relationship between depression, metabolic conditions, and the development of T2D. 
3.To develop models of the complex relationship between depression and T2D development.
Hypothesis: The risk of T2D due to depression will be higher in people with either metabolic conditions or less healthy lifestyle behaviours, and highest in people with both. Changes in lifestyle behaviours will explain some of the relationship between depression, metabolic conditions, and T2D. 
Methods: Data will come from the Emotional Well-being, Metabolic Factors, and Health Status Study, a study of T2D development in 2525 Quebec residents aged 40-69. The study began in 2008-2010, was followed-up in 2014-2015, and another follow-up is planned for 2016-2017. Advanced statistical techniques will be used to analyse data. 
Impact: The results from this project will contribute to 1) identifying individuals at high risk of T2D 2) developing models of T2D development in Canada and 3) informing health policy related to depression and T2D."

We aim to investigate how different types of engagement affect knowledge translation when stakeholders come together to create and negotiate standards. Our interdisciplinary team proposes to study how knowledge is communicated in the negotiation of standards in three case studies: 1) the international Human Proteomics Organization (HUPO) and its Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI) which creates human proteomes research standards for the development of personalised medicines; 2) the implementation of global vaccine safety standards and their uptake in a developing country; and 3) negotiations for biomedical standards that will recognize the environmental and health consequences of pollutants in the Walpole Island First Nation. Using qualitative ethnographic methods including interviews, observations and document analysis, this comparative study represents the continuum of standards development and stakeholder engagement from lab to public: before a biotechnology reaches society-wide application and is integrated into public discourse (HUPO); during the implementation of global vaccine safety standards; and after technical standards of health risks have failed and been challenged in public discourses (Walpole Island). We will evaluate knowledge translation between scientists, clinicians, industry, regulators and communities, producing accounts of systematic patterns of communication and mis-communication between stakeholders engaged in standardization. Targeted areas will be identified to facilitate more effective engagement and knowledge translation between stakeholders in future, and produce a model of participation in biomedical standardization which will aid regulators, policy makers, researchers and practitioners involved in assessing and implementing new standardized health technologies."

"An investigation of the relationships between self-control, executive functioning, physical activity, and self-control strength training in children with and without neuro-developmental disorders","['Graham, Jeffrey']",['N/A'],"['Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Discorder', 'Children', 'Developmental Coordination Disorder', 'Ego Depletion', 'Executive Functioning', 'Physical Activity', 'Self-Control']",135000.0,319016,"Self-control, the ability to exert control over one's thoughts, emotions, or behaviours is linked to many positive physical and mental health outcomes. However, there is a cost at exerting self-control in that it consumes internal resources leaving us vulnerable to subsequent self-control failures. Understanding how and why self-control failures occur in children is important as self-control abilities assessed during childhood have been linked to better health and well-being 30 years later. Importantly, self-control can be trained in young adults however there is no research examining this premise in children. Physical activity (PA) has been linked to many acute and long-term health benefits but most Canadian adults (15%) and children (7%) do not meet the Canadian PA guidelines. This is of particular concern as children who are physically active when they are young are more likely to be active as adults. Furthermore, children with neuro-developmental disorders, such as developmental coordination disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, have difficulties exerting self-control and display even lower levels of PA which is linked to poorer physical and mental health over their lifespan. Interestingly, recent evidence shows brief bouts of PA improves self-control in young adults, however the effects of PA on self-control in children remains limited. The proposed research aims to tackle these issues by investigating the effects of PA on indicators of self-control and health/well-being in children. As well, if regular systematic practice of certain types of PA that require minimal coordination (e.g., walls sits or plank), but require self-control to perform (i.e., resisting the temptation to quit) can be used to train self-control in children with and without neuro-development disorders. Overall, findings from this research will help to inform parents, teachers, practitioners, and build on current self-control and PA research relating to children."

Population-Level Effects of Pregnancy Complications on Maternal and Offspring Mortality,"['Grandi, Sonia']",['N/A'],"['All-Cause Mortality', 'Cause-Specific Mortality', 'Population-Based Research', 'Preconception Exposures', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Risk Prediction']",150000.0,397050,"Pregnancy complications, including hypertension and diabetes during pregnancy, occur in 1-8% of pregnancies and are associated with serious outcomes in mothers and infants. Previous studies have shown that women with more than 2 complications and/or consecutive pregnancies affected by pregnancy complications are at higher risk of a negative outcome. Additionally, women with pregnancy complications have been found to have a higher risk of heart disease. New research suggests that these complications may also impact the long-term health of children. There is therefore a need to understand how pregnancy complications effect the risk of death in women and their children and how the risk of death differs within and between pregnancies. There is also a need to find new risk factors that will identify women and children at increased risk of death.

This project will use 46,474 women enrolled in the Collaborative Perinatal Project from 1959-1965 across the United States. Children of women enrolled in this study will also be used. We will examine the effect of pregnancy complications on the risk of all-cause and cause-specific death among women and children and how this effect differs within and between pregnancies. A predictive model will be subsequently developed to identify factors prior to or during pregnancy that predict future risk of death in women and children.

This study will provide a better understanding of the impact of pregnancy complications on the risk of death in women and children. The findings of this work will also help to isolate risk factors that can identify women and children at highest risk. This work has the potential to improve the long-term health outcomes of mothers and children through the early detection and management of risk factors."

However, many of the health problems we associate with old age can be reduced through regular exercise.  Physical activity (i.e., playing sports, walking, gardening, lifting weights) is an important part of healthy aging as it helps people live independent, productive lives.  However, physical activity levels typically decrease with age, which has important consequences for both personal and public health.
The goal of this CIHR Caf√© Scientifique is to engage with members of the public around the topic of physical activity in later life.  Specific topics that will be covered include the biological and psychological benefits of physical activity with respect to age and emerging areas of aging and activity research.  A special emphasis will be placed on exploring barriers and facilitators of an active lifestyle.  Through an open discussion with activity and aging researchers and members of the public, we hope to start people thinking and talking about the role of physical activity in healthy aging. Based on the discussion content, we will also generate a document of physical activity concerns and recommendations from the view of the public through which organizations can use to improve physical activity programs and policies."

Differences in emotional self-control can be linked to distinct patterns of brain activity and different types of parent-child interactions. The purpose of our research is to track changes in brain processes that result from successful treatment and to link these changes to parent-child interaction patterns targeted by treatment. The specific aims are to: 1) examine associations between behavioral and neural variables underlying clinical subtypes, including aggressive, anxious, and comorbid children; 2) assess neural variables before and after treatment and at one-year follow-up, to discover how treatment works and test the role of neural controls of emotion; 3) to test correlations between neural changes and changes in parent-child interaction, to see whether improvements in parent-child interaction either precede or follow from changes in the brain's means for controlling negative emotion; 4) partner with community-based treatment agencies to further develop relevant research questions and translate the results to refine treatment practices. To address these aims, families will be recruited from agencies providing evidence-based interventions for childhood aggression and anxiety. Families will be assessed with the same measures before and after treatment and one year following treatment. Parents and children will be videotaped in a comfortable laboratory room while they discuss emotionally ""hot"" topics. Then, children will engage in a brief computer game designed to elicit negative emotions (frustration, anxiety) while brain activity is recorded. Children's behavior problems will be assessed by parents, teachers, clinicians, and self-reports. By examining profiles of change due to treatment, a model of developing emotion regulation capacities can be tested-a model that can help explain atypical developmental trajectories and the impact of treatment on these trajectories."

Scale-up: Adapting an effective older adult physical activity intervention to achieve impact at the population level,"['Gray, Samantha M']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Award'],1000.0,400120,"By 2050, 30% of Canadians will be older adults. Thus healthy aging is a public health priority. Health promoting physical activity programs contribute to healthy aging by decreasing prevalence of chronic disease and preserving mobility and independence. Still, older adults are among the most sedentary Canadians; 85% fail to meet physical activity guidelines. To improve population health, programs need to be scaled-up to reach more people and adapted across diverse settings to meet the needs of diverse populations. In 2015 the British Columbia (BC) Ministry of Health released a physical activity strategy; older adults were identified as a priority. Thus, we engaged government and community stakeholders to co-design and deliver a physical activity program (Choose to Move, CTM) for older adults. CTM increased physical activity and mobility among older adults at small scale (2016-17; 56 programs). It will be scaled-up across BC in 2018-20, providing an opportunity to study how best to adapt CTM for scale-up.

The purpose of my research is to describe the adaptation process and resultant adaptations to CTM prior to its scale-up across BC. We adopted a 9-step adaptation process: 1) identify stakeholders; 2) conduct needs assessment; 3) develop prototype of recommended adaptations; 4) validate prototype with stakeholders, 5) create adapted program; 6) pilot test adaptations, 7) modify adapted program, 8) implement adapted program; and 9) evaluate effectiveness of adapted program. Here we describe steps 1-6 and organize the data with an adaptation coding tool. The adapted program includes content, context and training adaptations. To address the need for more 'opportunities to socially connect' among CTM participants we: added more group meetings, reduced phone check-ins and adapted provider training to integrate social connections for older adults. Flexible, adaptable programs are more likely to be successfully delivered at scale and have equal impact as smaller trials."

Rates of varicella and related complications have decreased dramatically since the introduction of the vaccination program.  To prevent outbreaks of varicella all persons who are not immune should be vaccinated.  Adult immigrants from tropical countries are more likely to be susceptible (non-immune) to varicella because varicella occurs at an older age in tropical countries and immigrants are not given varicella vaccine before arriving in Canada.    A fifth of Canadians are foreign born and the majority of new immigrants come from tropical countries therefore there is a large proportion adult immigrants who are probably non-immune to varicella.  This is important because adults are more likely to develop severe varicella and to be hospitalized or to die from varicella than children.  A safe and effective vaccine (~85%) has been available in Canada since 1999 but there are no programs in Canada to routinely give varicella vaccine to the new immigrants.   This is because there are no good studies to prove that immigrants are more likely to get varicella, to become more sick from varicella or how this may have changed since the introduction of a varicella vaccination program in children.   We propose to do a study where we will measure and compare the number of cases of varicella and associated hospitalizations and complications due to varicella in the immigrant compared to the Quebec born population before and after introduction of the childhood vaccination program.  We will use this data to do an economic analysis to determine what is the best vaccination strategy for this population.  The results from this study will provide policy makers with the information they need to develop targeted varicella vaccination programs for the immigrant population to ensure that they stay healthy and are not involved in outbreaks."

Newly available treatments are very effective in curing the virus if given before advanced liver disease develops.  For these drugs to be effective, uptake at all steps along the hepatitis C care pathway (diagnosis, linkage to care, treatment and cure) needs to be high.   There are no Canada wide studies on the hepatitis C care pathway however, modelling studies suggest that only half of all hepatitis C cases are diagnosed. The groups at highest risk for hepatitis C in Canada including drug users, migrants from countries with high rates of hepatitis C, and baby boomers (born between 1945-1965).  Each group has different challenges accessing hepatitis C screening and treatment.  Drug users have barriers accessing health care because of substance abuse and mental health, migrants have cultural and language barriers and recent guidelines have recommended not to screen baby boomers for hepatitis C.  Understanding how many people in the key hepatitis C risk groups are screened or treated will help design the best hepatitis C control programs in Canada. 

The aim of our study is to measure the number and proportion of people screened, linked to care, treated and cured from hepatitis C in Canada and in the key risk groups.  We will use these results to run models to determine which steps along the hepatitis C care pathway we should invest for each risk group. Our study results will provide decision and policy makers with information so that the most effective screening and treatment programs can be developed to prevent complications and deaths from hepatitis C and to achieve hepatitis elimination in Canada."

A factor driving this situation is housing instability(2). Aboriginal peoples are over-represented among Canada's homeless populations(3) or are living in single-room occupancy hotels and other transitional living arrangements(4). Unstable housing contributes to health disparities, can prevent access to appropriate health service, and is associated with poor physical health, mental illness and HIV-related risk behaviour, such as drug use and exchanging sex. Although various housing and health initiatives have attempted to structurally address these complex issues, unfortunately social housing designs are often based on Western constructs and force Aboriginal peoples to live in homes in ways not originally intended or that inadvertently suppress cultural identity(7). This study aims to identify and work towards addressing gaps in appropriate housing options that support cultural identity and concepts of home for Aboriginal peoples living with and affected by HIV and AIDS. A multiple method approach involving a programmatic and policy scan and digital story-telling will be used by our academic and community-based research collaborative to work with Aboriginal people living with and affected by HIV and AIDS to explore cultural meanings of housing and home and how this links with health status and HIV transmission. This will be used within an integrated approach to knowledge translation and exchange to support a culturally appropriate response to Aboriginal housing needs in the context of HIV.

The proposed study will contribute to discussions about the proper role for the criminal justice system in the HIV response in Canada, situating the discussion within the context of gender, race and HIV-related stigma. It will provide evidence of the impacts of criminalization on women living with HIV and the HIV response in Canada that can be used in law reform or litigation activities aimed at changing the overly broad criminalization of HIV non-disclosure in Canada. Additionally, this study will contribute to developing processes to support women living with HIV in deciding whether, when and how to disclose, and to access the services they need by understanding and dismantling criminalization creep into health and social services.

This urges attention to factors that disproportionately affect immigrants' health.  Immigrant women are particularly vulnerable because of migration and gender-based disadvantages.  Sexual and reproductive health is one area where research has shown that immigrant women show worse outcomes and face barriers accessing care.  However, most research focuses on health care settings and neglects the potential impact of the broader environment on immigrant women's sexual/reproductive health.  In particular, features of the places in which people live, such as health services and social support, have been shown to influence sexual/reproductive health.  Place may be especially important to immigrant women's health because they bear a disproportionate burden of poverty and an increased risk of living in low-income neighbourhoods.  

The objective of this research is to explore how immigrant women feel that the places in which they live impact their sexual/reproductive health.  This project moves beyond studies that describe health-related differences between places, to understanding how place affects health.  An approach will be used that combines two different research methods: qualitative interviews with recent immigrant women living in Ottawa, and geographic mapping of the health and immigration services in Ottawa neighbourhoods.  Ottawa is home to a significant and diverse immigrant community, but it is underrepresented in the migration and health literature.  Together, these multiple data sources will allow for an in-depth exploration of this issue.

The results of this study could inform community-based initiatives to improve sexual/reproductive health access and outcomes among immigrant women.  In addition, interventions based on the results of this study could help Canadian society to benefit from healthy new members of the population."

If left untreated, advanced cases of syphilis can even lead to death. Of particular concern is a recent increase in syphilis among females and syphilis transmission from mother to fetus. In response, the British Columbia (BC) Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) is leading the revision of the BC Syphilis Action Plan, which includes a goal to increase syphilis testing. However, to do this, we must first understand current patterns of syphilis testing and diagnosis in the province and determine who to prioritize for testing.

Our project proposes to fill these knowledge gaps in BC by determining 1) who is currently getting tested, how often people get tested, if people are also testing for other STIs at the same time, and how this is changing over time, 2) how testing differs by sub-populations, and 3) how the detection of new syphilis diagnoses is influenced by testing, and how diagnoses are changing over time and among sub-populations. We will do this by using integrated laboratory, surveillance, and administrative data of BC residents available at the BCCDC. 

This information will lead the BCCDC to an improved understanding of syphilis testing uptake and how often people are getting tested, more valid measures of new syphilis diagnoses, and identification of sub-populations with higher rates of infection in BC. This information may also be used by regional and provincial stakeholders in BC to inform and mount a public health response to prevent and control syphilis (e.g. identify populations for targeting testing promotion campaigns). Moreover, these testing and diagnosis measures may be used as indicators to measure progress of national syphilis initiatives, such as the Pan-Canadian Sexually Transmitted and Blood-Borne Infection (STBBI) Framework for Action."

It's marked by things like weaker grip, low energy, slow walking, less physical activity, and weight loss. Frailty can lead to various health problems such as disability, premature death, and a lower quality of life. Healthy diets, such as the Mediterranean diet, can lower the risk of frailty or prevent frailty from getting worse. Collecting information about people's diet is challenging and does not account for the unique ways each person's body digests and uses food, influenced by the diverse communities of bacteria residing in their gut. To give better dietary advice, we need to better understand what we eat and how it affects frailty. Metabolomics, the study of small molecules produced by the body may provide insight regarding the pathways through which diet impacts frailty. Most studies so far have looked at single molecules or specific foods when studying diet and frailty, but it is likely more complex than that. One important pathway to explore is inflammation. It is thought that changes in our body's metabolic profile from our diet may lead to inflammation, which can cause frailty or make frailty worse.

We will also examine if the association between diet-based metabolites differs between males and females."
Development of an age- and sex-specific fall risk index for older adults based on a multilevel analysis of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging,"['Griffith, Lauren E', 'Beauchamp, Marla K']","['Kuspinar, Ayse', 'Macedo, Luciana G', 'Ma, Jinhui', 'Mayhew, Alexandra J', 'Montero Odasso, Manuel M', 'Nascimento, Paulo R', 'Raina, Parminder S', 'Saunders, Stephanie']","['Aging', 'Falls', 'High Risk', 'Population Health', 'Public Health', 'Screening']",70000.0,481307,"We know that risk of suffering a fall increases with age and after a first fall episode. Sex traits influence the risk of falls and although falls are more common in women than in men, their consequences are worse in the latter. Most falls occur due to multiple factors, and it is not easy to identify who is at high risk of falling. There is no single measurement that can predict falls on its own. Combining different measures may help to detect those at risk for future falls. Thus, we will develop measures, called indices, to examine the risk of future falls. These indices will be age- and sex specific. To build these indices, we will combine different measures collected in the Canadian Longitudinal study on Aging. This study will allow us to define the main fall risk factors for older men and women living in community across Canada. We will identify subgroups of people (men and women, age 65-74 and 75+) with a greater number of fall risk factors and assess their strength in each subgroup. This project will help us address the policy-relevant question of ""who are the most risk of future falls?""."

Less clear, though, is whether social position also influences healthy aging: do better educated individuals manage to enter old age healthier and to slow down the aging process? Another, related question, is to know whether this social advantage always exists or can be stronger or weaker depending on time and place. Reliable and definitive answers to these questions are nowhere to be found (not only in Canada, internationally), due to methodological and data issues. In this project, we will take advantage of two types of data available in Canada to produce a reliable answer to these two questions, thus contributing to international knowledge and to policy discussions on healthy aging in Canada."
Associated risk factors and genetic variants for incident autoimmune disorders following SARS-CoV-2 infection in adults in Ontario,"['Grima, Alicia A']",['N/A'],"['Autoimmune Disorder Post Covid-19 Infection', 'Genome-Wide Association Study (Gwas)', 'Log-Binomial Model', 'Post-Viral Syndrome Or Long Covid', 'Risk Factors', 'Risk Ratios', 'Sars-Cov-2 Or Covid-19']",105000.0,496568,"Long COVID affects an estimated 10% to 70% of individuals who contract the COVID-19 virus. It affects multiple systems in the body, causing symptoms such as cough, fever, and depression. A recent study on those with a history of COVID-19 found increased risks of several autoimmune disorders compared to those without a history of COVID-19. Studies investigating the causes of autoimmune disorders have uncovered complex underlying causes including genetic predispositions and environmental triggers. Research has shown that under normal conditions the age of onset for autoimmune disorders varies heavily between types and within types. Studies have also shown clear differences in the rates of most autoimmune disorders by sex, with females predominantly affected.

This study will: 1) Determine the incidence of new onset of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS), and/or psoriasis (Psa) following a COVID-19 infection among adults in Ontario; 2) Investigate the impact of age by sex on new onset RA, SLE, GBS, and/or Psa following a COVID-19 infection among adults in Ontario; and 3) Identify genetic variants associated with autoimmune symptoms of long COVID among adults in Ontario. This study will use Ontario health administration data available through ICES and genetic data from the Canadian COVID Genomics Network (CanCOGeN) HostSeq.

With no known cause of long COVID it is extremely important to provide context to this condition. Thus, this research will be a crucial step in helping to demystify the risk factors surrounding long COVID autoimmune disorders. This study may also identify individuals at risk for autoimmune disorders post COVID-19 infection, allowing targeted interventions and treatments to be developed. This would also provide the evidence needed for the conduct of more studies with long-term follow-up or investigating mechanisms of long COVID."

Months after acute COVID-19 is over, many people keep having symptoms that affect their ""normal"" daily functioning. This condition is called ""Long COVID"".  Very little is known or understood about Long COVID. It has been estimated that almost 1 out of 7 people who get COVID-19 will develop Long COVID. But we don't know what specific problems they experience. We also don't know what type of health care or rehabilitation they need.

There are many barriers to accessing health care. These include access to rehabilitation. People in rural/isolated areas have fewer health care options than people in cities. People with lower incomes face barriers to healthcare. Concerns or past negative experiences with the healthcare system may be a barrier. COVID-related restrictions on travel and gathering create more barriers to accessing health care.

Learning from people with Long COVID is critical to understanding its impact. Patient views and experiences should help us know how to best treat Long COVID. Current treatment guidelines recommend self-management or rehabilitation. But these guidelines are based mainly on the opinions of experts. The views and preferences of patients have not been studied.

We will interview people with Long COVID to better understand their health problems and rehabilitation needs. We will learn if they are getting the help they need for their condition. We will also ask about their experiences with rehabilitation and the health care system. Lastly, we will ask how well currently available services met (or did not meet) their needs. Our results will allow us to make specific recommendations to help people with Long COVID get the help and rehabilitation they need. Results will help improve rehabilitation for Long COVID in Canada and inform international rehabilitation guidelines. (The research team for this project includes people living with Long COVID.)"

The influence of light at night exposure and clock gene polymorphisms on melatonin levels and breast cancer risk.,"['Grundy, Anne L']",['N/A'],"['Biomarkers', 'Cancer', 'Clock Genes', 'Epidemiology', 'Light At Night', 'Melatonin', 'Nurses', 'Occupation', ""Women'S Health""]",105000.0,184726,"Studies of both women and men working night shifts have demonstrated links between shift work and some cancer sites, such as breast, endometrium, colon and prostate. Many scientists think that these relationships are determined partly by increased exposure to light during night shifts, which can decrease levels of melatonin, a hormone produced in a pattern that follows daily rhythms, which can increase cancer risk. These daily (circadian) rhythms are coordinated by a set of eight ""clock"" genes. Some variants of these clock genes may be linked with cancer risk, although the mechanism through which this occurs is not known. Further, it is unclear whether the observed effect of these genetic variants on cancer risk occurs independently or whether the effects of clock genes and light at night exposure on cancer risk may be related. 

This research will examine the relationships of both light at night exposure and clock gene variants with melatonin levels and breast cancer risk. Links with melatonin will be investigated through a longitudinal study of female rotating shift nurses, where light exposure is assessed using a light data logger and melatonin levels are obtained from blood, urine and saliva samples. Blood samples will also be used to characterize clock gene variants. The relationship between clock genes and breast cancer risk will be examined through another study that involves individuals with and without breast cancer, where again blood samples will be used to determine the presence of clock gene variants. This project will contribute to the understanding of the biologic mechanisms underlying the relationship between shift work and cancer. Since shift work is a necessary component to many occupations, a greater understanding of these mechanisms will aid in the development of shift work patterns that are best for health."

In response, many regions offer increasing options for home care and similar programs. Having a family or friend caregiver is critical to making such program work but most of the time caregiving is described as a dyad - in other words, one person who provides care (the caregiver) and one person who receives care (the care receiver). We know that this is not always the case and that caregiving relationships are non-dyadic, including situations where multiple people provide care to one person and where one person is both a caregiver and care receiver across different relationships. Our aim is to describe how frequently such non-dyadic care relationships are reported by Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) participants, describe what these non-dyadic relationships look like in terms of the caregiver and care receiver characteristics, their relationship to each other, and the kinds of care activities they do, and to describe health service use among people in non-dyadic care relationships. We will also compare CLSA participants in non-dyadic care relationships to CLSA participants in dyadic relationships to identify potentially important differences. We will use data from each of CLSA's Baseline, Follow-up 1, and Follow-up 2 surveys so that we can look at each time point as well as describe changes in the caregiver-care receiver relationship over time. Because caregiving is considered a gendered activity, we will pay particular attention to the different roles, relationships, and activities reported by women and men in our analyses. This research will contribute to our understanding of the complexity of care relationships so that we can learn how to best support caregivers and the people that they look after."

Mental health problems, labelled as post-traumatic stress injuries (PTSI), can result from those exposures and may include anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) suggests that within the first month following the traumatic event, we should repeatedly assess the employee exposed to a traumatic event in order to detect early development of symptoms and help manage these difficulties before aggravation. New technologies, such as mobile device applications, may be a useful way to complete repeated assessments in real time. The proposed research is a longitudinal study that intends to apply NICE's recommendation by monitoring PTSI symptoms in real time (via a mobile application) among trauma-exposed firefighters and to study the trajectory of PTSI and associated factors over three months. Two hundred male firefighters will be recruited throughout all fire stations in Montreal, Canada.

The success of such social innovation is in part determined by the capacity and ethical foundations of underlying local institutions.  Yet net benefits of economic globalization at the macro level have been asymmetrical, to date, and, in fact, significantly aligned with poverty and wealth, which, in turn, leads to expanding health inequities.  Rural and remote populations are especially affected by these conditions, due to their reduced local governance capacity and resources. Yet most of the rural health policy discourse, to date, has focused on physician and hospital services access, rather than on the upstream global processes which can significantly impact rural and remote human viability. Global forces are not limited to economic processes and policies. Global forces can include dimensions of urbanization and population migration, information technology, social policy, and natural environmental degradation and climate change.  

Our vision is a program of research to examine the complex mechanisms and systems-related factors by which rural people respond to global forces in rural and remote regions, leading to enhanced understanding of the pathways by which these can manifest as health inequities. Working as a team of international researchers and knowledge users and community members, we have adapted the Labonte-Schrecker model of globalization to support a series of case studies of the influences of these forces in different rural and remote settings around the world. The case studies provide opportunities to examine and discuss shared features of pathways of health inequity experienced within different rural population settings and from different global forces."

Potato production has nearly doubled in the last 30 years and new crops are being grown in greater quantities.  Agricultural fertilizers have concurrently increased. Non-domestic retail sales of pesticides escalated from 600,000 kgs in 2008 to over a million kgs in both 2013 and 2014. The Canadian Cancer Society- PEI Division (CCSPEI) identified pesticides as the number one concern by 83% of respondents in a 2014 survey of community residents.   Repeated fish kills and increasing estuarine anoxic events have alerted many Islanders about the potential for both pesticide and nitrate contamination of soils and groundwater and health effects. Tensions have escalated to the point of food tampering and repeated potato recalls, with associated social and economic stresses. Dialogue between the CCSPEI, research team members and PEI government representatives in June 2015 launched this current collaboration.  

This proposal is situated in the social determinants of health literature that considers the links between 'upstream' social, economic and environmental systems within a global context, their interrelations with intermediary determinants of health that function within more regional and local environments, and the associated health outcomes for human populations. Rural populations are known to be at health disadvantage in comparison to their urban counterparts. We hypothesize that the human and ecosystem health impacts of these influences can be mitigated by careful implementation of an integrated Intersectoral Prevention Strategy (ISPS) administered and overseen by an Intersectoral Advisory Council. The goal is to ultimately reduce risk of agrochemical exposures and positively influence the health of individuals, families and communities on PEI. Working with CCSPEI, our role will be to support and evaluate the implementation of this ISPS and research its effectiveness."

Medications (prescription and non-prescription) are commonly used to prevent and treat conditions. To help guide the assessment and treatment of persons with physical disability taking medications, it is important to ensure that clinicians use a patient-reported outcome tool that takes into account how patient's feel about the impact of their medications (positive and negative) on their quality of life. Our team will develop a patient-reported outcome for persons with physical disability (PRO-mQoL). We will obtain important feedback from persons with physical disability across the different stages of the research activities to help inform the development of the tool.

Improving Obesity Outcomes Using Demand Side Interventions in Canada,"['Guindon, Godefroy E', 'Lavis, John N', 'Wilson, Michael G']","['Baskerville, Neill B']","['Demand-Side Measures', 'Knowledge Synthesis', 'Obesity', 'Systematic Review']",99970.0,247771,"The obesity epidemic in Canada, the United States and several European countries has led to calls for policies to address the rise in the prevalence of diseases associated with obesity. The economic burden of illness attributable to overweight and obesity in Canada is substantial. The total direct costs attributable to overweight and obesity were estimated to amount to $6.0 billion in 2006, about 4.1% of total health expenditures. Moreover, existing research suggests an inverse association between socioeconomic status (SES) and adiposity in children (i.e., higher SES groups tend to have lower rates of obesity). Additionally, a recent systematic review indicates that dietary behaviours may contribute to socioeconomic inequalities in overweight/obesity in Europe.

Designing an evidence-informed approach to improving obesity outcomes using demand-side interventions requires the creative interplay of, on the one hand, the best available data and research evidence and, on the other hand, the tacit knowledge and views and experiences of those who will be involved in or affected by the issue. We will produce an evidence brief that draws on the best available data and research evidence to define to define problems faced in preventing obesity, identify and characterize possible policy and program options for addressing the problems, and identify key implementation considerations for these options."

There is overwhelming Canadian and international evidence that increases in tobacco taxes reduce tobacco use, save lives and increase government tax revenue. However, high taxes create an incentive for tobacco users, manufacturers and others, most notably criminal networks, to devise ways to avoid or evade tobacco taxes. From the mid-2000s, the effectiveness of tobacco tax policies in Canada has been hampered by the emergence of discount brands and the resurgence of contraband cigarettes, most notably in Ontario and Qu√©bec.

The illegal nature of cigarette tax evasion makes it intrinsically difficult to measure accurately. The scattered and at times conflicting estimates combined with the tobacco industry's narrative that cigarette contraband has been increasing in recent years and that any changes in policies such as tax increases or plain packaging will inevitably lead to large increases in cigarette tax evasion warrant a more systematic, transparent and timely approach to examine cigarette contraband in Canada. We have three research objectives. Our first objective is to estimate the magnitude of and temporal changes in cigarette tax evasion. Our second objective is to use the estimates of cigarette tax evasion constructed in objective 1 to study the relationship between cigarette tax evasion and cigarette prices (licit and illicit) and policy changes. Our third objective is to explore smokers' motivations for purchasing contraband cigarettes through an embedded qualitative study.

Overall, this research has the potential to make important contributions to the evidence base on pricing and taxing policies to inform regulatory developments. Understanding the burden of cigarette tax evasion in Canada is critical for improving public health interventions and reducing the burden of tobacco-related disease in Canada."
The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of population-level policies to reduce alcohol use: a systematic review,"['Guindon, Godefroy E', 'Halligan, Michelle']","['Tarride, Jean-Eric', 'Wilson, Michael G']","['Health Equity', 'Population-Level Policies', 'Systematic Review']",100000.0,452586,"Alcohol consumption is currently the world's third-largest risk factor for disease, attributable for about 5% of the global burden of disease, with clear links to conditions such as neuropsychiatric disorders, gastrointestinal diseases, cancer, intentional injuries, unintentional injuries, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes. In youth, heavy episodic drinking (HED), such as binge drinking, has been associated with long-term consequences such as cognitive, structural and functional brain changes and liver disease.  Canadians are among the largest consumers of alcohol in the world. The most recent cross-country data indicate that Canadians (15+ years) consumed 10 litres of alcohol per capita as compared to the global average of 6 litres per capita. In addition, almost one fifth of Canadians over the age of 12 were classified as heavy drinkers in 2018 and 2019. Since the COVID-19 pandemic started, alcohol use has dramatically increased, highlighting alcohol consumption as a chief area of concern for population health.

Given the clear risks associated with alcohol use and the levels of alcohol consumption in Canada, federal, provincial, territorial and municipal governments have an important role in developing and implementing evidence-informed policies to reduce the consumption of alcohol. These policies may include decreasing access and availability of alcohol (e.g., via taxation, minimum pricing, outlet density, minimum age for sale, hours of sale), and regulating marketing and advertising of alcohol (e.g., plain packaging and volume of advertising).

Our aim is to systematically review and synthesize evidence about the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of population-level policies to reduce alcohol use. We will draw upon literature from several disciplines - health economics, health policy, political science, psychology - to present comprehensive findings."
The Mental Health of Children and the Role of Prevention: An Updated Look at the Policy Process.,"['Gulbransen, Erik']",['N/A'],"[""Children'S Mental Health Policy"", 'Policy Processes', 'Prevention', 'Qualitative Methodology']",17500.0,255389,"Approximately fourteen percent of youth experience mental illness at any given time. Despite the estimated fourteen billion dollars Canada spends on mental health services and supports, about three-quarters of children and youth needing specialized treatment do not receive it. The mental health of children has thus been referred to as the orphan of the orphan within the Canadian health care system. Recent reports, though, suggest that many provinces and territories have increased their investments in the mental health of children, however, access to services continues to be inconsistent across the country. The current study will expand upon a national survey of prevention programs targeted towards the mental health of children published five years ago, which found there to be a lack of such programs at that time. The current study will assess if any progress has been made in this area and investigate the reasons why or why not. First, the current number of programs specific to preventing mental illness among children will be determined by conducting searches for government issued news releases, and then communicating directly with government officials. The researcher expects that there will have been an increase in prevention programs, but, that there will be considerable differences in care found across Canada. The second phase will investigate why there has, or has not, been an increased focus on the mental health of children. Interviews will be conducted with policy makers in order to ask open ended questions about the challenges they face if, or when, prevention programs are implemented. Follow up questions will ask how these obstacles have been, or may be, overcome. A greater commitment to prevention programs relevant to the mental health of children has the potential to increase the quality of life of Canadian children and their families, as well as reduce the financial burden of taxpayers who financially support our over burdened health care system."

The ""Using Health and Community Data to Prevent Youth Homelessness"" (UDPYH) project will use anonymized Calgary-based data from Alberta Health Services, Government of Alberta, and youth shelter program (Trellis Society) to visualize common service-use pathways and identify opportunities for prevention and intervention of youth homelessness and negative health outcomes. This proposed research will build off of this project and take a community-based participatory research approach to include of the perspectives of youth who are homeless into the context of the project using participatory methodologies. Initial goals and questions of this research include: 1) What are the different pathways through health and shelter services into youth homelessness? 2) What role does diversity (race, religion, mobility, age, gender, sexual orientation) play in how individuals experience service use pathways? 3) How can integrated data be used effectively to improve health outcomes and service delivery to prevent youth homelessness and support youth who are homeless? This research aims to ensure that youth perspectives/realities are centered in data interpretation and translation into practice. Youth experiencing homelessness are unique and heterogeneous, and therefore the application of approaches to preventing homelessness must be equally adaptable and individualized (Jadidzadeh & Kneebone, 2021). Using a community-based participatory research approach ensures that knowledge translation directly corresponds to the experiences of youth and service providers as they divert and prevent youth homelessness."

Appropriate weight gain during pregnancy helps to improve outcomes for both mothers and their babies in women of all weights, including obese women. Due to limited and controversial findings of current studies, there is no tailoring of weight gain recommendations during pregnancy by severity of obesity. Although weight loss during pregnancy is not recommended, it has been shown that 5-8% of obese women in general, and up to 15% of women with extreme obesity, reported intentional weight loss during pregnancy. Given that a clinical trial of weight loss during pregnancy is not ethical, a high-quality observational study is greatly needed to explore potential harms of intentional weight loss during pregnancy for mothers and their babies. Our study will use Ontario birth registry data to examine the impact of weight loss during pregnancy on a wide range of adverse maternal and infant outcomes among obese women, divided into more precise obesity classes. Our study will overcome limitations of previous studies and fill research gaps by investigating dose-response effects of weight loss during pregnancy on perinatal outcomes. The study findings will inform prenatal counseling and help guide weight management during pregnancy and improve the quality of care for obese women. The current study will provide relevant, contemporary evidence of short-term perinatal outcomes of intentional gestational weight loss among obese women. Future research is needed to create optimal weight gain trajectories specific to obese women, based on their severity of obesity."
Scientifically sound and ethically justifiable: towards a new understanding of evidence in psychiatry,"['Gupta, Mona']","['Potter, Nancy']","['Bioethics', 'Diagnosis', 'Epistemology', 'Evidence', 'Evidence-Based Medicine', 'Psychiatry', 'Qualiatative Methods']",66469.0,254814,"Although the contemporary era has been seen tremendous advances in medical technology, psychiatrists do not have sophisticated blood tests and scans to diagnosis problems as do doctors in other areas of medicine. As a consequence, there has been a longstanding debate about whether psychiatric diagnoses are really objective, or whether they just reflect the opinions of the time. Over the last twenty years, psychiatrists have been taught to base their practice on research studies, rather than on what they learn from their clinical experience or from patients during individual appointments. Basing practice on research studies seems more scientific, and psychiatrists have come to regard this new approach as reassurance that psychiatry is just as objective as any other area of medicine. 
 
Research studies do contribute one kind of knowledge to practice, but they do not tell us everything we need to know in order to practice psychiatry well.  As a result, practitioners are left with many unanswered questions about what to do with knowledge they obtain from sources other than research studies. For example, complicated interactions might occur between patient and doctor in a session that give insights into the diagnosis. Is it ethical to take into consideration these insights? If so, under what circumstances?  Is it ethical to practice only on the basis of research studies?  Our research project addresses exactly these questions. We will investigate what kinds of knowledge should be used as the basis of psychiatric practice and, in particular, the determination of psychiatric diagnosis. Our project is vitally important to ensure that both practitioners and patients are aware of the strengths and weaknesses in the knowledge that lies behind psychiatric diagnoses.  The results of this project will help to establish what kind of knowledge is needed for scientific and ethical psychiatric diagnoses."

We will use different data sets covering a wide range of contextual information on local climates, socioeconomic characteristics, and built environments that may facilitate or hinder physical activity in daily life. We will link these data sets to multiple years of individual-level data on having developed diabetes and other chronic diseases, or being hospitalized for these largely preventable conditions. This is important because using one data source alone would not give us good measurements that reflect the complexity of factors influencing people's health. We use statistical tests to examine trends over time in how living in more-walkable versus less-walkable neighbourhoods are related to chronic disease outcomes."

Older women can experience various forms of abuse, neglect, and violence by their spouses, children, and others who provide care. Many studies have focused on this concern but there is limited research about how abuse can be prevented, particularly among older immigrants in Canada. Building on the studies I have already conducted, the purpose of my program of research is to design and test a comprehensive intervention to prevent abuse and related health problems among older immigrants. This program of research will bring together researchers, older immigrant women and men, their families, health, social, and settlement service providers, and key partners in various levels of government in four provinces. The research program will help: 1) identify factors that contribute to abuse of older immigrants and available strategies to address these factors; 2) verify these factors and strategies across the four provinces through focus groups held with older women, older men, and their families from various immigrant communities, and service providers and policymakers; 3) use these findings to design a comprehensive intervention to help prevent abuse among older immigrants; and 4) test how acceptable and effective the intervention is in preventing abuse and its health problems among older immigrant women and men. The findings have the potential to generate new knowledge that will ultimately contribute to safer communities, and result in major cost savings to the Canadian health care system as well."

Like other forms of interpersonal violence, older women fall victim to this violence more often than men. Such experiences have serious negative effects on women's physical and mental health. Although many studies have examined this topic, little research has focused on the ways in which violence against older immigrant women in Canada can be prevented. The purpose of the proposed research program is to design and test a complex approach (intervention) to prevent violence and its negative influence on health outcomes among older immigrant women. The program will bring together researchers, health, social services and settlement providers, older women and their community members, and other key partners in various levels of government. The work is guided by an ecological framework and a feminist theoretical perspective in order to examine the individual, familial, community and societal factors that affect older women's experiences of and responses to violence. The program will involve four phases: 1) to identify the contributing factors to violence against older immigrant women and the existing intervention strategies to address this violence in order to provide a foundation for development of a multi-level intervention, 2) to validate the relevance of the identified contributing factors and selected strategies in the prevention of violence across the four provinces through focus groups with abused older women, their families and community members from various immigrant groups, and health, social and settlement service providers and policymakers, 3) to integrate the findings gleaned from the common and unique experiences of violence into the design of a multi-level, multi-component intervention, and 4) to test the applicability, suitability, and effectiveness of the designed intervention in the prevention of violence and promotion of health among older immigrant women."
Our Health Counts: Advancing Health Equity Using Indigenous Community-Driven Research,"['Gustafson, Maureen']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2800.0,391617,"Problem
Indigenous peoples frequently experience significant health disparities compared to their non-Indigenous counterparts. In Canada, such disparities are masked by inadequate population health data. Non-response and misclassification errors are systematized in core information platforms, resulting in an undercounting of the Indigenous population and hiding of health inequities. These issues impede effective health promotion planning, implementation, and evaluation.

Response
Several urban Indigenous communities in Ontario, Canada have partnered with the Well Living House-an action research centre for Indigenous health and wellbeing-to build health information platforms using Indigenous community-driven processes. Data is gathered using an innovative and scientifically-respected process called Respondent Driven Sampling, health assessment surveys, and linkage to health service data. Results have informed programs and services to better address communities' needs. Community leadership and engagement has been integral to the project's success, having driven every stage of the research from preconception to knowledge translation. Indigenous reference groups, predominately comprised of representatives from the local community and service providers, give direction and set research priorities.

Significance
In keeping with the dual criteria of scientific excellence and Indigenous community relevance, Our Health Counts provides high quality health information data founded on Indigenous ways of knowing, doing, and being. As such, these findings strengthen evidence-based health promotion and wise practices in Indigenous health research. Finally, self-determination and project sustainability are promoted through community leadership and control, in line with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People. Self-determination goes beyond empowerment, recognizing unique socio-political forces that can act as barriers to Indigenous health and wellbeing."

To better understand what leads to this we interviewed 26 healthcare providers (11 physicians, 6 nurses, 4 social workers, 4 pharmacists, and 1 dietician) who provide acute care for individuals living with HIV in Toronto and Ottawa. Participants described a range of reasons why patients leave early, from poor pain and withdrawal symptom management (often resulting from stigma towards people who use drugs or are perceived to be using drugs) to feelings of boredom and isolation. Some participants described having contingency plans in place when they suspect patients will leave early, including developing a community care plan and having prescriptions ready to give patients on their way out. Others were less prepared and under extreme circumstances resorted to having security or the police retrieve patients.

Disappointingly, Canada also has high rates of criminalizing people living with HIV for transmission, non-disclosure and exposure. The overarching goal of this event is to explore intersections between the criminalization of HIV and the use of new HIV treatment and prevention technologies and interventions in the Canadian context (e.g., the use of HIV treatment with the goal of obtaining an undetectable viral load to reduce transmission). In keeping with the objectives of the CIHR planning and dissemination grant opportunity, we will undertake a series of related activities. First, we will host a one-day symposium to disseminate findings from CIHR funded research and to facilitate a structured dialogue between interdisciplinary and inter-professional stakeholders working at the intersection of research, clinical care, service delivery, public health and criminal justice with the aim of planning future directions for research and practice. The objectives of the symposium are as follows: 

1. To disseminate findings from an innovative CIHR-funded research study that explores the health and social impacts of criminalization in relation to HIV non-disclosure in Canada;   
2. To promote dialogue about the health and social impacts of HIV criminalization facing different populations in Canada (e.g. people who use drugs, people who sell sex, migrants) from the perspective of those most affected and those in research and practice roles, and plan next steps; 
3. To promote dialogue about ethical and methodological issues in conducting health and social research with criminalized people and identify best-practices and plan future research;
4. To provide content for a report and fact sheets to disseminate findings from the symposium for academic, provider, policy and community audiences."

Unraveling the Thread of Transmission: Pairing Traditional Epidemiology with Genomics to Understand Tuberculosis Transmission Dynamics,"['Guthrie, Jennifer L']",['N/A'],"['Epidemiology', 'Genomics', 'Infectious Disease', 'Public Health', 'Transmission', 'Tuberculosis']",105000.0,347892,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a major cause of disease and death in much of the world. More than 20 years after the World Health Organization declared tuberculosis a global emergency, TB remains entrenched in the world's population. In Canada, after decades of decline in TB incidence, progress towards control has stalled. Foreign-born Canadians, Indigenous communities, as well as incarcerated and under-housed individuals are at the greatest risk of TB. Indeed, the incidence in certain sectors of the Canadian population can exceed that in developing countries. While TB represents a significant burden to the health-care system it also exacts a physical and emotional toll on these already vulnerable individuals. The stigma associated with TB often results in lost social status, housing and jobs. 

Recent advances in technology now allow the full DNA sequence to be read from TB bacteria isolated from patients. Analysis and comparison of tuberculosis DNA sequences from TB patients in British Columbia over a 10-year period will allow us to detect small changes in the DNA which occur as TB is spread from one person to the next. Combining this information with key patient data we will piece together person-to-person transmission of the disease. Therefore, utilizing these new advances in DNA sequencing combined with traditional epidemiology (study of the distribution and determinants of disease), we seek to significantly improve our understanding of TB transmission. This novel approach is the largest of its kind ever attempted in Canada, and the knowledge gained will be used to strengthen efforts in TB control by identifying common patterns of disease spread, potential risk factors for transmission, as well as communities in which there is ongoing person-to-person spread of the disease. Understanding the transmission dynamics of TB is crucial to improving awareness, education, early detection, and ultimately stopping the spread of tuberculosis in Canada's most at-risk communities."
Genomic Epidemiology of Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus Infections Prior to and During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"['Guthrie, Jennifer L']","['Golding, George R', 'Katz, Kevin C', 'Law, Madelyn P', 'Maguire, Finlay', 'McGeer, Allison J', 'Olawoye, Idowu B', 'Simpson, Jared T']","['Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Applied Bioinformatics', 'Covid-19 Pandemic', 'Genomic Epidemiology', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Mrsa', 'Population And Public Health', 'Whole Genome Sequencing']",100000.0,494305,"The World Health Organization has declared antimicrobial resistance a major global health threat and lists methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a priority pathogen. MRSA can cause severe infections and spreads by direct contact with infected individuals or contaminated surfaces or medical devices. Originally, MRSA mostly affected people in hospitals, but is now also common in the community. Hospital and community-associated MRSA strains differ, where hospital strains are resistant to more antibiotics and community strains can spread more easily and cause severe skin and soft tissue infections. However, in recent years, these strains have been found in both settings. This is concerning because MRSA can easily pick up beneficial genes from other bacteria, and the movement of these strains between settings poses the risk of more deadly MRSA infections that are highly resistant to antibiotics and easily spread. In Canada, MRSA is not regularly tracked outside of healthcare settings, and its genetic analysis has not been done on a population level. Our project aims to study MRSA genetics by analyzing samples collected from infected individuals across Ontario, including both hospital- and community-associated MRSA. We believe the COVID-19 pandemic and related public health measures may have affected the types of MRSA strains that are spread in the population. By studying samples collected before and during the pandemic, we can better understand MRSA strains and identify genetic features that may help some of them survive antibiotic treatment and cause more serious disease. This information is critical for targeted interventions to stop the spread of MRSA. This project will provide a foundation for MRSA genetic studies in the post-pandemic era that can be used across Canada."
MRSA Genomics: Advancing Knowledge for Effective Interventions,"['Guthrie, Jennifer L']","['Golding, George R', 'Katz, Kevin C', 'Law, Madelyn P', 'Maguire, Finlay', 'McGeer, Allison J', 'Olawoye, Idowu B', 'Simpson, Jared T']","['Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Applied Bioinformatics', 'Covid-19 Pandemic', 'Genomic Epidemiology', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Mrsa', 'One Health', 'Pandemic Preparedness', 'Population And Public Health', 'Whole Genome Sequencing']",822376.0,502208,"The World Health Organization has identified antimicrobial resistance as a critical global health issue, with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a major concern. MRSA, known for causing severe infections, was once primarily associated with hospitals but has now spread widely in communities, posing significant risks due to its ability to easily acquire genes from other bacteria that make it more resilient and harder to treat with antibiotics.

In Canada, MRSA strains are not routinely monitored outside healthcare settings, and genetic analysis at a population level is lacking. To bridge this gap, our research aims to study MRSA evolution, understand its antibiotic resistance mechanisms, and develop genetic analysis and monitoring tools. We will analyze MRSA samples from infected individuals, animals, and wastewater, with a focus on community-associated MRSA, to gain valuable insights that will inform interventions to combat MRSA.

Additionally, we hypothesize that the COVID-19 pandemic and related measures may have impacted the prevalence of specific MRSA strains. By examining samples collected before and during the pandemic, we aim to identify genetic features enabling strains to survive antibiotics and disinfectants, which were extensively used during the pandemic. This new knowledge and understanding is important for improving treatments and implementing effective measures against MRSA spread, thereby contributing to pandemic preparedness and strengthening healthcare systems in the face of future health emergencies."
Gender and parasitic diseases:  integrating gender analysis in epidemiologic research on parasitic diseases to optimize the impact of prevention and control measures,"['Gyorkos, Theresa W']","['Clark, Shelley', 'Montresor, Antonio']","['Deworming', 'Epidemiology', 'Gender Analysis', 'Global Health', 'Parasitic Diseases', 'School-Age Children', 'Worms']",100000.0,190638,"Parasitic diseases account for significant morbidity, mortality and disability worldwide. As a group, these diseases affect over one-third of the world's population, primarily in developing countries. Much of the research evidence base documenting determinants of parasitic disease outcomes is limited in terms of gender analysis. This limitation needs to be overcome in order to better understand, and to more effectively, efficiently and equitably respond to reducing the burden of parasitic diseases.

The overall objective of this research proposal is therefore to integrate gender analysis into research methods used in epidemiologic research on parasitic diseases. This will be accomplished by first identifying the gender gaps in current research, reviewing the fit of different methodological approaches in addressing these gaps, and undertaking a primary epidemiological research study in three different cultural endemic settings to identify gender determinants of infection.

Among the myriad of parasitic diseases which occur worldwide are soil-transmitted worm infections that affect over 2 billion people in tropical and sub-tropical regions. The high risk groups for these worm infections are school-age children, pregnant women and pre-school children. Because the school-age children have the highest prevalence and intensity of these infections, and because reducing infection in this group will also reduce disease outcomes in other population groups (through a reduction in environmental pathogens), school-age children will be the focus of our initial research.

The results we obtain will be used to plan a randomized controlled trial which would assess the impact of modifying one or more gender determinants in reducing parasite-attributable disease outcomes in this high risk group. A cost-effectiveness analysis will be done and continued interaction with local health authorities will inform effective health policy and practice."

These infections are especially damaging to the health of children, resulting in both short-term and lifelong disability. Older children with worm infections are more likely to be stunted, underweight, vulnerable to other illnesses and perform poorly in school compared to non-infected children. Large-scale deworming programs in school-age children are therefore recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). WHO also recommends deworming of preschool-age children (as of 12 months of age) in these areas; however, the benefits of deworming, especially in the 12-24 month age group, have been inadequately studied. This knowledge is urgently needed as studies show that all children have a similar potential for healthy growth and development, provided that appropriate nutrition and health interventions are given in the critical window of opportunity before the age of two.  

Therefore, we are proposing to undertake a randomized controlled trial to determine the optimal deworming program for improving growth and development in children between 12 and 24 months of age. Our results will provide solid rigorous evidence on if, and when, deworming should be integrated into routine child health care packages provided by Ministries of Health in the 130 countries in the world where worm infections are endemic."
"Sociocultural influences on mental health among transgender and gender-diverse children and adolescents in Canada, Thailand, and Mexico","['G√≥mez Jim√©nez, Francisco R']",['N/A'],"['Cross-Cultural', 'Gender-Diverse Adolescents', 'Gender-Diverse Children', 'Mental Health', 'Parental Attitudes', 'Peer-Relations']",135000.0,472144,"Transgender/gender-diverse minors include children and adolescents who do not identify with their birth-assigned sex. These minors experience elevated mental health risks, including suicidal ideation and behaviour, depression, social and separation anxiety, asocial behaviours, and lower self-esteem. Further, research shows transgender/gender-diverse minors' elevated mental health risks are related to greater likelihood of experiencing social stigma and discrimination, such as having poorer peer relations and/or parents who endorse gender-stereotyped attitudes. However, given that this research has been conducted in Western cultures where gender diversity is often stigmatized, it remains unclear whether transgender/gender-diverse minors experience similar mental health risks in more accepting sociocultural environments. Thus, the proposed research will assess whether transgender/gender-diverse minors in Thailand and the Istmo region of Oaxaca, Mexico, where gender diversity is highly visible and socially accepted, have better peer relations, more supportive parents, and, in turn, better mental health than their Western counterparts in Canada. In doing so, this study will provide significant insight into how transgender/gender-diverse minors' mental health is influenced by the cultural acceptance and visibility of gender diversity. Thus, this study will highlight the importance of structural interventions whereby fostering social acceptance is a key element in promoting mental health among transgender/gender-diverse minors."

Socioeconomic Inequalities in Child Health in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: The Effect of Social Policies,"['Hajizadeh, Mohammad']",['N/A'],"['Child Health', 'Global Health', 'International Health', 'Social Determinants Of Health', 'Social Policies', 'Socioeconomic Inequalities']",90000.0,282521,"There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating a social gradient in children's health outcomes within countries: children belonging to higher socioeconomic status (SES) households are in better health compared to their lower SES counterparts. While the current literature has highlighted the importance of SES on child health, there are a limited number of cross-national studies on socioeconomic inequalities in child health outcomes. Moreover, although extant work has demonstrated the impact of social conditions (e.g. lack of education) on health and health equity, evidence on how changes in social policies could be used to improve equity in child health are sparse. Thus, the proposed study aims to address this gap in the literature by assessing the causes of socioeconomic inequalities in two main indicators of children's health, low birth weight (LBW, less than 2.5 kg) and infant mortality (IM), across low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs). In the first stage, we will use information derived from more than 80 LMIC countries to measure and identify factors associated with socioeconomic inequalities in LBW and IM. The second step of this study will focus on the causes of socioeconomic inequalities in ill health. We will assess the effects of social policies (e.g. educational policies and labour market policies) in LMICs on the determinants (e.g. teenage pregnancy, risky birth interval, mother's education and etc.) and levels of socioeconomic inequalities in LBW and IM. The monitoring of socioeconomic inequalities in child health has an important role in gauging progress toward the commitments made by decision makers to reduce inequalities in health. Identifying the factors explaining such inequalities is also essential to implementing effective policies to redress these inequalities. This study, which empirically investigates the effects of social policies on child health, will also help to identify policy levers for improving child health and health equity."

Being active can prevent this from happening. Unfortunately, people with diabetes and high blood pressure tend to be inactive. In order to help people increase activity levels, we need information on what factors affect activity. Researchers believe that how 'walkable' a person's neighbourhood is determines how active a person is. Although this makes sense, we do not know where people spend most of their time. This is a problem because if people spend all of their time at friends' houses or at work then how active they are will likely not depend on characteristics of their neighbourhoods. In order to help people with diabetes and high blood pressure become more active, we first need to figure out where these people spend most of their time. This is the primary aim of my study. After the amount of time spent in home neighbourhoods is quantified, my secondary aim is to determine if neighbourhood 'walkability' is associated with activity level, regardless of how much time people spend in their neighbourhoods. Data will be collected on patients attending clinics in Montreal. Activity level and location will be assessed for one week using accelerometers and Geographic Positioning System units, small machines that are easily worn on the wrist or clipped onto a backpack. Neighbourhood 'walkability' will be assessed by having participants answer some questions on what they think about their neighbourhoods and by a special computer program that will tell us exactly how 'walkable' each neighbourhood is based on the patients' home postal codes. Mathematical models will then be used to figure out, for people who spend a lot of time in their neighbourhoods and for people who do not, if there is a link between neighbourhood features and activity level. Doing so will inform the development of interventions designed to increase activity levels and help reduce the risk of heart attack or stroke."

Modifiable school determinants of youth substance use,"['Halladay, Jillian E']",['N/A'],"['Adolescent', 'Cannabis', 'Emerging Adult', 'Multilevel Modeling', 'School', 'Student', 'Substance Use']",105000.0,383331,"Canada has the highest rates of youth cannabis use across 43 countries, which is of salient concern due to the impact on brain development. Evidence indicates substantial variation across schools in levels of youth substance use, above individual risk factors, suggesting that schools may serve as important settings for prevention efforts. However, the mechanisms by which schools influence youth substance use are not well understood.

The objective of this program of research is to gain a deeper understanding of the extent to which school settings influence youth substance use, with the ultimate goal of identifying modifiable factors within this setting to serve as targets for preventative efforts. These goals will be achieved by: conducting a systematic review of the literature that identifies factors in schools that can serve as intervention targets; obtaining accurate school effects, by accounting for the inter-dependent effects of families and neighbourhoods; exploring the mechanisms of school effects (such school climate, sense of belonging, and availability of resources) and if these effects moderate other risk factors; and examining whether school settings have long-lasting effects on substance use patterns in adulthood.

These objectives will be met through secondary analysis of two CIHR-funded studies: the 2014 Ontario Child Health Study, which includes over 10,000 youth, and the School Mental Health Surveys, which includes over 32,000 elementary and secondary school students across Ontario. We will use the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health, a study in the United States of elementary and secondary students followed from 1994 to 2009, to examine whether school settings have long-lasting effects on substance use patterns. 

The results of this study will help identify modifiable school contextual factors that are associated with youth substance use for potential intervention in the face of the changing cannabis culture in Canada."

We propose to gather together a research team composed of birthing women, practitioner, stakeholder and academic members of relevant expert and women's knowledge communities that will work together to create a community-based research program with the objective of gaining a fuller understanding of the complexities of the decision-making contexts in which decisions are made to surgically intervene in a birth. This project will prioritize the voices of women themselves in recognition that women are active managers of their own health, place this decision-making context within a historical and comparative frame, identify relevant wise practices from Canadian new immigrant, vulnerable women, and Indigenous communities concerning alternative experiences, and help foster the development of pilot intervention programs aimed at reducing caesarean ratse in British Columbia."

We will use data from an existing Canadian pregnancy and birth cohort: Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals Study. Maternal glyphosate exposure was assessed using an established biomarker (i.e., urinary glyphosate concentration). Child intellectual abilities and behaviours were assessed at 3-4 years of age. Analyses will use advanced statistical models while accounting for relevant covariates. The study will also explore potential sex-based differences in children's vulnerability to prenatal glyphosate exposure and investigate maternal thyroid dysfunction as a possible underlying mechanism. This research is critical for advancing our understanding of the potential risks associated with prenatal glyphosate exposure, particularly for those living in non-agricultural settings. The findings will inform ongoing evaluations of glyphosate's toxicity, help identify vulnerable populations, and guide potential exposure reduction interventions."

Additionally, research has found that messages that engage brain systems involved in attention capture and self-reflection are more likely to be acted upon. This project will use state-of-the-art theory and methods to identify optimal strategies for motivating COVID-19 mitigation behaviors in the pandemic's post-acute phase. Study 1 will be a 2-wave population on-line cohort survey of 2000 adults who have not received any vaccine shot. They will answer questions on key beliefs about COVID-19 and relevant behaviours (Wave 1). They will be randomly assigned to view 4 PSAs that vary in whether they are vivid, provide information about others, and highlight long-term benefits of protective behaviour. They will then rate the 4 PSAs on quality, emotional impact, informativeness, and perceived effectiveness. At Wave 2 (4 months later), respondents will answer a survey with the same measures on beliefs and behaviours since Wave 1, including vaccination status and other mitigation behaviors. We hypothesize that those viewing PSAs that are vivid, emphasize norms, and make long-term benefits salient will be more likely to have engaged in mitigation behaviours (e.g., getting vaccinated). Study 2 will be a lab study where participants will view all PSAs, and rate each on the same Study 1 dimensions. Eye tracking technology and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) will identify which PSAs are most attention-capturing and lead to deepest self-reflection. These studies will identify which COVID-19 PSAs are most effective for promoting vaccination and other mitigation measures for the current and future pandemics."
Water Policy Reform and Mental Well-being Impact Assessment in Alberta,"['Hallstrom, Lars K']","['Parker, Timothy', 'Purc-Stephenson, Rebecca']","['Aging', 'Environmental Justice', 'Health Equity', 'Impact Assessment', 'Mental Health', 'Mental Well-Being', 'Social Determinants', 'Water Policy']",,204649,"For the first time in 12 years, the Alberta government is considering whether to update their water allocation system. Increasingly, it has become apparent that there are increasing demands for a resource that is dwindling due to industrial exploitation, population growth and climate change. Given the geographic and demographic realities of the province (approximately 80% of the population lives in southern Alberta, while 60% of the provinces water supply lies in the north), there is no question that the allocation of water resources, both in terms of ecological services as well as a fundamental necessity of life and food security, is becoming a critical political question for Alberta.
Despite this political, economic and social importance, a key area that has not been assessed lies in the implications of both the current water system, and any reforms that are made to that system, in terms of health equity. This project proposes to evaluate the reform of water policy not from the standpoint of equity in terms of access to water, but rather the implications for health equity, and specifically the potential for significant inequities in the mental and physiological health of rural populations in the province."

Importantly, these rates can be further eroded by unanticipated disruptive events such as a pandemic for which there is yet no vaccine (e.g., COVID-19).  While control of COVID-19 will be more feasible once vaccine(s) become available,  this will not be a simple decision federally or for the provinces and territories as it is highly probable that different types of COVID-19 vaccines will be available in Canada which differ as to safety and efficacy parameters, age targets, etc. While practice/program decisions need to be based on sound scientific evidence, legal considerations relevant to program design and delivery will frequently arise. For example, consider cases in which there are differences between manufacturer license recommendations and effective case- and conditions-sensitive use by and within programs.  This project is a first step in gaining a better understanding of immunization, both routine and responsive i.e. in a pandemic, as a 'regulated space' . Laws may both help and may also hinder.

We will include all adult offspring residing in Manitoba between 1974 and 2020 and who can be linked to at least one parent. We will identify diagnoses of mental disorders and physical health conditions in these individuals and their family members (i.e., parents, grandparents, and siblings). Mental disorders will include mood and anxiety disorders, schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, or substance abuse disorders. We will use machine-learning techniques to identify specific risk factors from these detailed health histories to predict mental disorders in the adult offspring. This innovative study will be the first of its kind; constructing thorough, objectively-measured health histories from existing databases to predict the likelihood of mental disorders. Identifying individuals at risk of mental disorders will help develop early support programs and inform healthcare resource decisions. Investigating the influence of family health histories with different degrees of relativeness will provide important information about mental disorders' developmental origins."

The Psychobiology of Health Maintenance in Late Life: Examining Modifiable Pathways to Healthy Aging,"['Hamm, Jeremy M']",['N/A'],"['Health Behaviours', 'Health Maintenance Motivation Intervention', 'Health Maintenance Strategies', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthy Aging', 'Psychobiology']",63750.0,377009,"An unprecedented demographic shift is occurring in industrialized nations that will present significant challenges for individuals and society. In 2016, the number of Canadian adults aged 65+ exceeded the number of children for the first time in census history, and this older demographic is projected to double in size over the next 50 years. Although Canadians are living longer, declines in physical health and functioning remain common in old age and have significant personal and societal implications: Recent projections indicate health care spending in Canada will increase by $2 billion per year from 2014-19 due to population aging alone. This underscores the need for a better understanding of modifiable factors that can sustain health into late life.

My postdoctoral research program seeks to address these challenges by identifying modifiable psychobiological mechanisms that may protect against biological dysregulation and physical disease in old age. The research will focus on whether volitional health maintenance strategies promote adaptive longitudinal changes in older adults' biological and physical health, and whether such changes are due to intervening psychosocial factors and health behaviours. My research will also examine if the benefits of health maintenance strategies differ for older adults who vary on demographic (e.g., age, sex), psychosocial (e.g., social support), and health factors (e.g., acute vs. chronic illness). 

Most important, my research program will develop and test a novel health maintenance motivation intervention to increase adaptive health behaviours in late life. This research may have significant implications to the extent that increasing positive health behaviours (e.g., physical activity) has the potential to improve the physical health and functioning of older adults and offset mounting costs facing the Canadian health care system."

Objectives: 1) Develop knowledge of FNIM cancer survivorship within Canada; 2) Identify barriers and facilitators of healing from the perspectives of FNIM cancer patients and health care professionals; 3) Work with community partners and stakeholders to translate this knowledge into culturally safe health services.
Design: My postdoctoral research project builds upon a ""parent"" study of FNIM women's cancer survivorship through arts-based methodologies including photovoice and story journaling. The findings from these photos and stories will be the basis for semi-structured interviews with health care professionals who work with FNIM peoples with cancer. The current study uses critical phenomenology, an approach that situates experiences of illness and healing within larger social processes and power dynamics in health care settings
Setting: Participants will be recruited from across Canada. 
Participants: 20 health care professionals from primary care and oncology who work regularly with FNIM patients.
Anticipated Results: Patients and health care professionals will provide important insights into the current status of FNIM cancer care. Based on these insights, knowledge translation strategies that honour these diverse perspectives and needs will be developed. 
Conclusions: A report from this research will be disseminated to participants and project collaborators for their feedback on the next steps toward translating this knowledge into health services."

The proposed project will engage important stakeholders involved in FNIM cancer care within Ontario, including health care professionals, health administrators, and FNIM community leaders. This study builds upon a national study on FNIM cancer survivors. Three objectives drive this research: 1) To identify strengths and needs within FNIM cancer care in Ontario from multiple perspectives; 2) To exchange knowledge of FNIM cancer experiences between stakeholders through arts-based methods, especially photography; 3) To work collaboratively with stakeholders to establish recommendations for improving FNIM cancer care. The project involves early consultations with stakeholders on the most pressing questions and issues in the area. Then, 20 participants (10 health care professionals, 5 health administrators, and 5 FNIM community leaders) will be recruited to use and discuss photos that capture experiences of FNIM cancer care. A report will be generated and dispensed to participants, bringing together various experiences, themes, perspectives, and recommendations for improving the state of care."
Cycles of silence around cancer within First Nations communities,"['Hammond, Chad']",['N/A'],"['Cancer Care', 'Community-Based Research', 'Health Inequities', ""Indigenous People'S Health""]",1300.0,343510,"Purpose: First Nation peoples with cancer have higher distress, higher burdens of disease, and higher mortality rates than the rest of Canadians. The National Picture project has explored the survivorship experiences of First Nation women with cancer and their caregivers. 
Methods: An arts-based, participatory study (interviews, photography, journaling, sharing sessions) was conducted with 43 participants (cancer survivors and their caregivers) from four First Nation communities in Canada.
Results: Two major themes have come out of initial analyses: 1) Suffering without support leads to cycles of silence: several social, historical and institutional barriers inhibit speaking about cancer and finding/providing support. 2) Helping and being helped without having to ask: communities exercised resilience to these challenges through the voluntary and unsolicited provision of support by community members. 
Conclusions: First Nation communities experienced inequitable access to formal, supportive programs and services, in part because of a lack of understanding of culturally relevant needs and colonial structures within healthcare systems. First Nation women with cancer desire the emotional, social, and financial supports established within their informal networks; however, they also require institutional provision of care that address culturally relevant needs, colonial impacts on cancer communication, and the disproportionate burdens of disease on First Nation families."
Widening the circle of care: Digital stories of caregiving in a First Nations community,"['Hammond, Chad']",['N/A'],"['Caregivers', 'Community-Based Research', 'Digital Storytelling', 'Indigenous Health']",987.0,364659,"The current research project builds upon the research findings, protocols, and community connections from a community-based parent project on the cancer survivorship experiences of First Nations and M√©tis peoples. One of the major themes coming out of that project was the limited resources and lack of support for their caregivers. The current project will involve exploring the experiences of caregivers within the Mohawk community of Kahnawake, a reserve of about 8000 people residing just outside the city limits of Montreal, QC. Community-engaged research with Indigenous populations has been found to be effectively facilitated by arts-based research, using visual methods like photography and video. The methodology of digital storytelling, in particular, has been favourably received within Indigenous communities as an extension of their oral traditions of storytelling and a way of preserving local knowledge in the digital age. The purpose of this study will be to explore the culture of caregiving within First Nations communities. In particular, we aim to:
1)Explore the experiences of both informal (e.g., family members, friends) and formal (e.g., health professional) caregivers who support cancer survivors within First Nations communities.
2)Identify caregivers' resources, needs, and potential gaps in their support.
3)Create digital stories of caregivers' experiences as a dissemination tool.
This research will contribute to the development of potentially beneficial interventions and establish culturally meaningful ways to communicate and support Indigenous caregivers. The digital stories and summaries of the research project will be co-owned with local health organizations in Kahnawake, as well as disseminated more broadly by online and social media."
Widening the circle of care: Digital stories of caregiving in a First Nations community,"['Hammond, Chad']",['N/A'],"['Arts-Based Methods', 'Cancer', 'Caregiving', 'Community-Based Research', 'Culture And Health', 'Indigenous Health']",1300.0,400047,"Community-based caregiving is an essential source of support for adults living with chronic illnesses like cancer. Although there is a robust literature on caregivers' experiences of caring for someone with cancer, low priority has been given to how caregiving relates to culture-the expressions, values, and practices of caregiving within different ethnic groups. In particular, there is very little understanding of experiences of Indigenous peoples who provide care to others with cancer in their communities. 

The current community-based, arts-based project explored the experiences of caregivers within the Mohawk community of Kahnawake near Montreal, QC. Six caregivers participated in the creation of their own digital story, which brings together images, oral storytelling, and music to help people understand what it is like and what is at stake when caring for people with cancer in First Nations communities. 

The purpose of this study was to explore the culture of caregiving within First Nations communities, in particular:
1) The experiences of both informal (e.g., family members, friends) and formal (e.g., health professional) caregivers who support cancer survivors within First Nations communities.
2) Caregivers' resources, needs, and potential gaps in their support.
3) Digital stories of caregivers' experiences as a dissemination tool.

Analyses of the stories and the digital storytelling process highlight the importance of spirituality, community relationships and engagement, and processing grief for caregivers to maintain their role as well as their own well-being. This project builds upon the learnings from a parent photovoice project on the cancer experiences of First Nations and M√©tis peoples across Canada, which indicated a widespread lack of support for their caregivers. The current project is funded by the CIHR Institute for Indigenous People's Health."
Nutritional labeling on menus in Canada and the United States: Evidence to inform policy.,"['Hammond, David G']","['Hanning, Rhona M', 'Harnack, Lisa', 'Thompson, Mary E']","['Health Behaviour', 'Health Policy', 'Labelling', 'Nutrition', 'Obesity Prevention', 'Policy Evaluation']",100000.0,251068,"More than 60% of adult Canadians are obese or overweight. The increasing number of Canadians who eat at restaurants and fast-food outlets as part of their daily diet is believed to be an important factor in the rising prevalence of obesity.  Currently, there are no regulations in Canada that require disclosure of nutrient or calorie content of restaurant foods. In 2012, the US will become the first country to implement mandatory menu labeling at the federal level. The current study will examine the impact of nutritional information on menus on dietary patterns at the population level. The study will consist of nationally representative surveys and face-to-face exit surveys of restaurant patrons. First, population-based telephone surveys will be conducted with representative samples in Canada  and US jurisdictions without existing menu labelling. Surveys will be conducted using parallel measures and sampling designs to provide comparative estimates across jurisdictions.  Exit surveys will also be conducted with samples of 1,000 restaurant patrons in each of Toronto and Chicago. Primary outcomes will include: 1) awareness of nutrition information, 2) knowledge of calorie and nutrition content of food purchases and 3) behavioural changes, including calorie consumption. Analyses will also examine individual and socio-economic differences. Overall, the findings will have direct implications for policy in Canada and will address critical research gaps identified by Health Canada. The study will also provide the foundation for evaluating the implementation of new regulations in the US and future policy developments in Canada."

Population health interventions in chronic disease prevention: tobacco control and healthy weights.,"['Hammond, David G']",['N/A'],"['Chronic Disease', 'Diet', 'Health Weights', 'Nutrition', 'Policy', 'Tobacco Use']",,297427,"My research is dedicated to developing and evaluating population-level health interventions in two primary areas: tobacco control and healthy weights.  Tobacco use and obesity are primary risk factors for the leading causes of death in Canada, and both are characterized by socio-economic disparities. My research program features the use of ""natural experiments"" , international studies to examine policies across jurisdictions, and collaborations between different research disciplines to provide the highest quality evidence to inform policy. 

Specific objectives for my research program in tobacco use include: 1) to examine international variations in policy impact, 2) to understand how restrictions on tobacco industry marketing influence susceptibility to smoking and uptake among youth, 3) to understand the changing nicotine market and implications for tobacco control and public health, and 4) to examine changing patterns of tobacco use in Canada among socio-economic groups.  Specific objectives for my research program in diet/health weights include: 1) to examine the impact of nutritional labeling policies in key environments, 2) to evaluate the effectiveness of federal policy on energy drinks, 3) to examine public understanding and use of dietary guidelines and recommendations, and the extent to which new technologies can promote greater use and comprehension, and 4) to examine health literacy and use of nutrition information among youth and young adults. 

Knowledge translation is a central component of my work. I work closely with decision-makers and other public health stakeholders to identify priority research needs and to help shape the nature of my research. I have also played an active role in translating research and evidence to policy-making bodies throughout the world. Overall, the CIHR Chair in Applied Public Health would provide critical support for my research program and allow me to expand my knowledge translation and mentorship activities."

The study will examine the extent to which legalization is associated with changes in five primary outcomes: 1) the prevalence and patterns of cannabis use, including use among 'minors'; 2) risk behaviours, including driving after cannabis use; and 3) the commercial retail environment, including the price and the type of products used; 4) perceptions of risk and social norms; and 5) the effectiveness of specific regulatory policies, including advertising restrictions, product labelling and warnings, public education campaigns, and the use of cannabis in public spaces and workplaces.  

The proposed study consists of a quasi-experimental design with prospective cohort surveys conducted in Canada, as well as in two 'control' jurisdictions: US states where recreational cannabis use remains illegal ('US Illegal' states), and US states where recreational cannabis use has been legalized ('US Legal' states).  A cohort of youth and young adults (aged 16 to 30) will be recruited at 'baseline'- prior to the implementation of legalization in Canada- and at 12-, 24-, and 36-month 'post-implementation'. Representative samples will be recruited from each of three study conditions: Canada (n=10,000; 1,000 in each province), 'US Illegal' states (n=10,000), and 'US Legal' states (n=10,000).  Analyses will examine national-level changes in Canada over time compared to 'US Legal' and 'US Illegal' states, as well as between provinces to examine differences in policy implementation.

To date, there is a lack of data on SSB consumption in Canada to assess trends in dietary intake. There is also an immediate need to estimate the potential health care costs associated with SSB consumption to inform imminent policy decision in Canada. 

The overall aim of the proposed study is to examine patterns of SSB consumption and health care costs using estimates from the 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS). The project has four primary aims: 1) to estimate consumption of SSBs in 2015, overall and by individual SSB category; 2) to examine disparities in SSB consumption among population sub-groups, including by age, gender, food security, BMI, and region; 3) to examine changes in SSB consumption between 2004 and 2015, overall and by category, as well as among sub-groups; and 4) to estimate the current and future health care costs of Canadians' SSB consumption based on CCHS 2015 usual intake data using the ACE Markov cohort macro-simulation model, adapted for the Canadian population.  

Overall, the proposed study will help to address key questions about SSB consumption in Canada, including the extent to which it has changed and whether changes are consistent across sub-groups. The proposed study will support the development of nutrition and health policies and programs by generating evidence on the health care costs of SSBs. The ACE model will also provide a framework for estimating the impact of specific SSB interventions, including the impact of SSB taxation in Canada.

First, an environmental scan of cannabis retail sources will be conducted in each province annually, over a 4-year period. The scan will identify the location of legal and illegal cannabis stores, and collect objective measures of cannabis prices and potency. Second, data from the scan will be linked with data from the International Cannabis Policy Study, a CIHR-funded prospective cohort survey of 10,000 Canadians (1,000 per province, 16-65 years of age) conducted over the same 4-year period. The survey includes comprehensive assessments of cannabis consumption and purchasing-including product types, quantities, price paid, and purchase source-as well as household postal code to enable geographic analyses. Analyses will address five primary objectives: 1) to estimate changes in the retail availability and price of illegal cannabis in Canada following legalization; 2) to examine changes in legal and illegal cannabis purchases, including the overall size of the cannabis market in Canada; 3) to examine the impact of provincial retail policies, such as the number of retail stores, on cannabis purchases and market size; 4) to examine individual-level predictors of purchasing illicit cannabis, including geographic proximity to legal and illegal retail outlets; and 5) to examine changes in THC and CBD levels of cannabis products.

In Canada, the federal government has initiated consultations on FOP labels for sugars in pre-packaged foods, and a Senate Standing Committee has recommended taxing sugary drinks, which is under consideration at both the provincial and federal levels. There is an immediate need for evidence to guide these policy decisions. The proposed project has three specific aims: 1) to examine the efficacy of FOP labels and a sugar tax on food and beverage purchases, including differences among sub-populations; 2) to estimate free-sugar intake in the Canadian population; and 3) to model the health and economic burden associated with free-sugar intake in Canada, and the potential benefits of FOP labels and sugar taxation in reducing these health and economic costs. The proposed research consists of three sub-studies, each corresponding to a specific aim. Study 1 will estimate the efficacy of FOP labels and taxation using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) examining purchasing behaviour. A total of 3,000 participants (youth=1,500; adults=1,500), will participate in an 'experimental marketplace' study, in which the nutrition label (no-FOP control, FOP traffic light, and FOP star rating) and tax level (no-tax control, 10%, 20%, and 30% tax) of food and beverages products will be experimentally manipulated to assess the effect on consumer demand. Study 2 will analyze dietary recall data from the 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey to generate national estimates of free-sugar intake from food and beverages. Study 3 will use the data from Studies 1 and 2, along with data on health care costs, to model the avoidable health burden from free-sugar intake, and the population impact of FOP sugar labels and taxation.

First, the sample size of Ontario participants in the annual ICPS surveys would be increased to 6,000 respondents per year to examine policy impacts regionally and among key subgroups. Second, the partnership will establish a mechanism for the Cannabis Secretariat to contribute survey content to evaluate specific policies or programs, such as new retail initiatives or public education campaigns. Third, mechanisms will be established for the Cannabis Secretariat to make time-sensitive requests for targeted analyses on strategic policy issues. Fourth, annual cannabis policy evaluation reports will be created for Ontario, including key indicators for key research areas identified in the funding opportunity.

Recent estimates indicate that as many as 40-60% of youth and 19-25% of adults in clinical care have engaged in NSSI behaviors such as self-cutting, scratching, and burning. Moreover, individuals who engage in NSSI are 2-3 times more likely to attempt suicide than individuals who do not engage in NSSI. Despite increased research on NSSI over the past decade, clinical research on the identification and treatment of NSSI has been hampered by the paucity of large-scale longitudinal research. As a Postdoctoral Fellow, I will address this significant gap in the literature by examining an existing longitudinal database of children (4-9 years of age), youth (10-17 years of age), and adults (18 years of age and older) receiving clinical care in Canada (N = 897,766). The primary goals of my postdoctoral research will be to: 1) provide the first large-scale investigation of NSSI prevalence across multiple age groups (i.e., childhood, youth, and adulthood) among individuals in clinical care, 2) identify risk factors that differentiate self-injurers from non-injurers at the time of intake into clinical treatment, and 3) investigate change in mental health status over time among self-injurers receiving clinical care. My research will inform mental health care delivery in Canada, by providing new insight into the prevalence and developmental periods of increased vulnerability for NSSI. Moreover, an examination of the risk factors that differentiate self-injurers from non-injurers at treatment intake, as well as an examination of the treatment outcomes of self-injurers, will allow for more specialized treatment approaches to be developed that directly target individuals at risk for self-injury."

As many as 1 in 5 undergraduate students has engaged in NSSI, and students who engage in NSSI are at increased risk for other mental health concerns across the university years (e.g., depression, anxiety, suicidal behaviour). Although mounting research and theory suggest that NSSI is a form of coping behaviour used by students to reduce overwhelming negative emotions (e.g., stress, anxiety, anger), it is unclear why students engage in NSSI rather than other coping behaviours (e.g., talking to a friend, going for a walk) to reduce their distress. To clarify the emotional context in which NSSI occurs, and to identify ways to help students resist NSSI urges when distressed, the proposed study will examine associations among emotions, NSSI, and coping behaviours among undergraduate students who self-injure. In the first phase of the study, 280 students with a recent history of NSSI will complete multiple assessments each day for 14 days using a smart phone app, reporting on mood, NSSI urges and behaviours, and use of alternative coping behaviours. A subsample of participants (n = 20) also will be invited to participate in follow-up in-person interviews about their experiences with NSSI. The proposed project will advance health-related knowledge and theory by providing new insight into the processes through which NSSI occurs and is maintained. Moreover, identifying alternative behaviours and strategies students who self-injure can use to resist NSSI urges will equip mental health practitioners with strategies to help students reduce (and ultimately extinguish) the use of NSSI as a primary coping behaviour."
"Examining the social context of injection drug use and HIV risk amongst young, Aboriginal women in an urban Canadian setting","['Handlovsky, Ingrid E']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal Health', 'Critical Ethnography', 'Gender And Health', 'Health Equity', 'Health Promotion', 'Social Ecology', 'Substance Use']",105000.0,245808,"In Canada, Aboriginal women have higher rates of HIV when compared to other populations of women. Injection drug use (IDU) increases susceptibility to HIV infection, and data illustrates that young, Aboriginal women who use injection drugs are particularly susceptible to HIV infection. However, the complexity of the relationship between IDU and vulnerability for HIV infection among young, Aboriginal women is poorly understood. Specifically, there is lack of understanding regarding the larger social, economic, historical, and personal factors that influence IDU practices. Thus, the proposed project will explore the social context of young Aboriginal women's drug use in an urban context. The project will investigate how women use injection drugs, who they use with, where they use, and how and where they obtain the equipment to use to highlight the social, economic, historical, and personal factors that influence IDU practices. Data collection will involve interviews with 40 Aboriginal women aged 19-30 who are presently using injection drugs. Recruitment of participants for the study will occur with the support of an advisory committee of Aboriginal women in collaboration with sites in a neighbourhood where I and the research team have established relationships. The study will also include participant observation in the neighbourhood where women use drugs, and will focus on individual, interpersonal and structural factors that influence IDU practices. Examining the social context of Aboriginal women's injection drug use is essential to develop meaningful and effective HIV prevention efforts. If a clearer understanding is gained with regards to how young Aboriginal women are using injection drugs, meaningful health service programming can be developed. Ultimately, these health services will be designed specifically for the needs of this highly vulnerable population to minimize the transmission of HIV and improve health outcomes."
Indigenous Women's Health in the Mining Sector,"['Hania, Patricia']",['N/A'],"['Capacity Development Of Indigenous Women', 'Environments And Health', ""Indigenous Women'S Heath"", ""Indigenous Women'S Participation In Health Decision"", 'Interdisciplinary Research In The Mining Sector']",2800.0,400581,"In Canada, a dearth of research exists on Indigenous women's health and their participation in the natural resource development sector's decision-making processes leading to the question: What barriers do Indigenous women face in negotiating their health concerns in the mining sector's impact benefit agreement (IBA)? When a mining company enters a community, Indigenous women's experience of declining health is well documented by scholars, non-profit organizations, and Indigenous activists. Water contamination, drug use, violence against women and their children increases in the community resulting in women being disproportionality and affected differently by the negative impacts of mining. In short, the health impacts of mining are not gender neutral. However, scant research exists on whether these health impacts and women's health concerns are taken into account in an IBA. In the Canadian mining sector and globally, the IBA is the dominant instrument that structures the relationship between the company and the Indigenous community. The purpose of this private contract is to take into account the impacts and benefits of the development project upon the community, and to obtain consent from the First Nation to gain access to the resources. However, the confidential nature of the IBA and the dominance of the agreement in the sector highlights the pressing need to understand how Indigenous women and their health concerns are taken into account in an IBA negotiation, and the final agreement.

This interdisciplinary research project builds on my doctoral research on the governance of drinking water in Canadian provinces, and expands into the area of Indigenous women's health. A finding from my doctoral research is that Indigenous women were absent in the governance process resulting in Indigenous women's health underreported. This current research expands upon the collaborative research completed during my doctoral studies on women's health with the NNEWH."

Health research has increasingly pointed to the ways in which inequities are shaped by the several factors, including gender, race, geography, and socioeconomic status. Though many countries have focussed on one or more of these categories in health reform efforts, population health inequities persist, indicating a need to better address how multiple factors can intersect to shape health and health behaviours.  Focusing on the Ukraine population as a case study, this project closely examines the ways in which diverse and unique factors influence the health of individuals. Through population data analysis and an innovative public consultation process, the project addresses existing knowledge gaps surrounding the extent and distribution of illness, disability, and other health experiences in Ukraine. The project's objectives include: i) the generation of an evidence base of the health and health needs of the population and its vulnerable subgroups; ii) the production of a synthesis paper outlining strategic priorities for national health policy in Ukraine; and  iii) the development of an innovative policy tool for social inclusive health policy reform. As a guide for improving understandings of marginalization and reorienting research and policy priorities in public health, the tool will revolutionize how researchers, policy makers, NGOs and the general public understand and address health inequities in Canada and internationally."

However, how to operationalize the 'plus' in this work is often unclear and misunderstood among health research and policy actors, signaling a need for more clarity and guidance on intersectional analysis in SGBA+.

The proposed project will address this need by creating a strengthened version of the Intersectionality Based Policy Analysis Framework (IBPA) (2012), to serve as a best practice analytical approach to the '+' component of SGBA. This 'IBPA 2.0' will include international health policy case examples demonstrating its value-added. The project will also strengthen competencies in applying this framework via the development of a community of practice and a massive open online course, required to accurately think about and apply intersectionality.

Overall, the outcomes of the proposed activities will allow for researchers and policy makers in Canada and abroad to better act upon the mechanisms shaping inequities in health. Also, because the proposed work involves students, researchers and key stakeholders, the skills for applying effective SGBA+ will be developed within Canada and beyond."

Quantifying benefits of local active transportation investments: a collaborative health and engineering approach to mobilize on healthy urban policy,"['Hanson, Trevor R']",['N/A'],"['Active Transportation', 'Engineering', 'Health', 'Performance Measures', 'Public Space']",63065.0,499867,"The world is moving towards more sustainable forms of transportation than the automobile, yet the automobile continues to be the dominant mode of transportation in North America, and in smaller cities such as Saint John. Changing travel behaviour requires overcoming considerable inertia in favour of automobile travel. While numerous resources espouse the health benefits of active transportation these benefits are often not articulated in a way that would permit an equitable comparison with the benefits with improvements to the automobile transportation network, which tend to be more immediate and tangible (e.g. reduced collisions, improved traffic flow and access).  Furthermore, the practical realities of the Canadian winter can discourage transportation planners from considering active transportation solutions when they are seen as a ""6 month"" mobility solution. Finally, there is often a lack of travel behaviour data for active transportation use, which can be both in terms of the actual amount someone incorporates active transportation into their trip-making, as well as an understanding of the conditions that would encourage their modal shift.  

This Planning Grant for Implementing Healthy Urban Policy presents an opportunity to build on the current inertia for active transportation solutions and uptown urban core enhancements in Saint John by positioning the city to be able to quantify and articulate the health and wellbeing benefits associated with these improvements.  Saint John's position as a regional hub for health, education, commercial, and industrial services in southern New Brunswick provides an opportunity to research, develop, and demonstrate approaches and practices for better integration of planning for active transportation among different levels of government and the private sector that will be applicable for other communities in New Brunswick."

The total direct and indirect cost of mental health problems was estimated to be dollar14.4 billion in 1998, placing it among the most expensive health conditions in Canada. In order to design cost effective interventions at the community level, prevention efforts must be informed by an understanding of how social determinants of health (SDOH) affect mental health, and the pathways between SDOH, and mental health and wellbeing. The specific aims of our study are:
AIM 1 : To explore neighbourhood factors in St. James Town that influence newcomers' and non-immigrants health and wellbeing.
AIM 2: To examine the processes and mechanisms that will help explain the relationships between social determinants of health at the neighbourhood level and health outcomes.
This proposed research is using the St. James Town (SJT) neighbourhood of Toronto as a case study to explore the implications of perceived neighbourhood attributes on mental health and wellbeing of newcomers. Using a cross-sectional design this study will capture gender specific experiences of two major groups (a) newcomers i.e. Chinese, Tamil, and Filipino and (b) non-immigrant. The study will gather data through structured face-to-face interviews of 1500 adults in the language of the participants.
The findings from this case study will help the development of strategies that promote community mobilization and help newcomer communities influence public policy, secure improved local services, and build on existing successful community strengths that promote mental health and wellbeing."

Effective antibiotics are essential to cure infections, and for the prevention and treatment of infectious complications in the provision of health services. 
Many experts agree that if the challenges posed by AMR are not addressed, we will be heading towards a period analogous to the pre-antibiotic era, when infections were synonymous with high mortality rates. To tackle this issue, effective international frameworks and action plans need to be developed. Many global organisations and governments have identified potential solutions with the objective of building governance arrangements. Yet none of these propositions have studied the impacts that conflict settings pose to the development of AMR. Currently more than half of the world's population live in countries with ongoing conflicts. 
Our research proposal aims to study the links between the emergence of AMR and conflict settings. Our interdisciplinary group will combine approaches from the fields of anthropology, medicine, law and public health to the case study of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAb). MDRAb, a previously uncommon human pathogen, came to international attention in 2004 following reports of high rates of infections in wounded U.S. soldiers in Iraq. It has since become one of the three most critical pathogens identified by the World Health Organization for the development of new antibiotics. MDRAb remains one of the most common causes of infection among wounded civilians in the many conflicts that persist in the Middle East.
In addition to the research we will undertake, we aim to establish at Universit√© de Sherbrooke an Interdisciplinary Research Centre on the Global Governance of AMR in Conflicts. This centre will be well positioned to conduct inter-sectoral research on the global governance of AMR and to participate in broader international collaborations."

This group faces many challenges including racism, lower income, and reduced access to health care. These barriers may increase diseases such as obesity and diabetes and affect lifestyle choices. Bariatric surgery, a type of weight loss surgery, is the best treatment option for obesity.  

Manitoba's only bariatric program follows a patient-centered approach, combining surgery with support, education and resources to promote behavior change. However, teachings around Indigenous wellness are not a part of current bariatric surgery programs. Traditional healing practices are just as or more important than Western medical approaches for Indigenous Peoples. Indigenous patients want access to traditional healing methods, yet they are not available in bariatric care.  

The objectives of this study are: 1) to use sharing circles, an Indigenous group research approach, and individual interviews to better understand the experiences of Indigenous patients after surgery; 2) to develop guidelines for incorporating Indigenous wellness teachings for Indigenous patients into the current bariatric care model; and 3) to assess patient experiences with bariatric Indigenous-focused teaching materials delivered before surgery.

Incorporating Indigenous teachings around health and wellness will strengthen the current approach to bariatric care. Offering traditional ways of healing will encourage Indigenous Peoples to actively participate in their care, leading to better health outcomes after bariatric surgery. This study has the potential to show that the inclusion of traditional healing methods into our bariatric program can positively affect the health care experiences of Indigenous patients."

We often measure these aspects of health by asking people to report on how much difficulty they have with certain activities or health conditions.  However, people from different countries or from different backgrounds may interpret the same question differently.  For example, asking a 25-year old and a 70-year old how much difficulty they have walking stairs may be difficult if the two individuals use different scales when thinking about their ability.  This means that observed differences between countries or social groups reflect both objective differences in health and also differences in the way people interpret the questions.  Recent developments in survey techniques now allow the possibility of accounting for differences in the way individuals understand questions about their health by using brief descriptions of specific health states to put everyone's responses on a similar scale.  This study will use these 'anchors' to provide better measures of the prevalence of non-fatal health conditions across different countries, and between gender and economic groups within countries.  The findings from this study will help to provide better measures of the importance of non-fatal health conditions across the globe."

Approximately 50,000 Canadians are currently living with PD, and this number will increase as the average age of Canadians increases, because older people are more at risk for PD.  We now understand that PD arises as people lose neurons that produce a vital chemical signal. But scientists have yet to solve the question of why certain people lose enough of these neurons to produce PD and others don't. Work in agriculture has been identified as a risk factor for PD, but not all of this risk seems to be explained by exposure to pesticides as was first suspected. Could farmers have another exposure in common that may cause PD? This study addresses this knowledge gap. We are interested in a particular risk factor: endotoxin, which is a component of certain types of bacteria and is released as the bacterial cells break down. In animal studies, endotoxin can destroy neurons in the brain and produce a PD-like effect. In agriculture, exposure to endotoxin occurs through contact with large volumes of organic matter (e.g. manure or stored grain) in enclosed spaces. This study will examine a large group of 84,000  farmers (The Agricultural Health Study) to determine whether endotoxin exposure (determined by responses to a detailed questionnaire on daily tasks and duties) explains which of these farmers have PD and which do not. We will also look at a subset of approximately 500 of these farmers who were visited to take measurements of dust (and endotoxin) in their homes and on their farm equipment. Combined, the two projects will help us identify whether this suspected risk factor for PD may indeed be a cause. A better understanding of the causes of PD can help to prevent the occurrence of this debilitating disease."
Bicyclist and pedestrian crashes in Ontario: Detection and comparison of health outcomes between police-reported collisions and injury health care records,"['Harris, M.

The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a new focus on active transportation as a ""safe"" (physically-distanced) travel option. But people walking and bicycling are more vulnerable to road injury. Studies of bicycling and pedestrian injury often rely on police-reported collisions data. However, not all walking and bicycling road injuries are reported to police or entered into collisions records, especially when motor vehicles are not involved or where their involvement is indirect. Police-reported collisions data also contain minimal information on outcomes following injury. Health care records can help detect additional road injuries and the outcomes of these injuries for bicyclists and pedestrians.

This project will learn from a linkage between reported collisions and health care records of bicycling and pedestrian injury in Ontario in 3 ways: 1) Ministry of Transportation (police-reported) collision records will be linked to records of health care use (emergency department visits and hospital stays) to compare bicycling and pedestrian collisions reported to police and those found in health care records. We will examine how characteristics that are individual (e.g. gender, age), neighbourhood (socio-economic status), and regional (rurality) affect the chance of being detected in both reported collisions and health care records. 2) We will annually update the linkage as new data become available, including the time period of COVID-19. 3) We will look at what happens to injured pedestrians and bicyclists after crashes, comparing collisions reported to police and those found in health care records, by following their hospital and physician visits after injury. This study will build new partnerships between road safety surveillance and epidemiologists, and form groundwork for prevention of active transportation injury in Canada."
Injury Risks among Canadian Bicycling and Walking Commuters: A new application of the Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC),"['Harris, M.

Healthy cities encourage active transportation because it has many benefits to cities and their residents. But people walking and bicycling are more vulnerable to road injury and safety concerns may affect the choice to use active transportation. While Canada has good information on the number of injuries and fatalities among pedestrians and bicyclists, this is not enough to tell us about the rates and risks of injury among users of active transportation. For risk and rate calculations, we need to know how many people use each form and how much they use it (how far and how long they travel). This will then allow ""apples to apples"" comparisons between groups such as men and women, or between provinces and cities, or within cities before and after changes are made to try to improve safety. Our project will help fill this gap in our knowledge. We will use data created by Statistics Canada and Health Canada: the Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort (CanCHEC). This is a cohort that follows participants in the long form Canadian census and determines health outcomes they experience over follow-up. The long form census collects information on how people get to and from work, which will allow us to isolate bicycling and walking commuters to determine their risk of injury. We will use records of hospital treatment (including cause of injury) to determine who has been injured and death records (including cause) to determine fatalities. We will examine how risk of injury differs between men and women, by age, by measures of wealth, and by scores that measure whether their neighbourhood design encourages active transportation. This project will build new ways to evaluate, compare and monitor risk among active transportation users for cities, city planners, health care providers, injury researchers and road safety advocates."

The goal of the Network is to support and expand research capacity, skills, and career trajectories of Indigenous early career researchers, health care practitioners, and trainees across the program's two sites in Wabanaki and Labrador, Canada.

The Network involves a suite of activities that include mentorship opportunities for Indigenous graduate students and early career researchers, a health research portal to connect communities with research opportunities, place-based summer institutes and field schools, a seed grant and scholarship program, and an assessment of Indigenous health research priorities in the region. 

The AIM Network is impacting the Indigenous health research field by supporting the next generation of Indigenous health researchers; leveraging the mentorship capacity of established researchers and Indigenous community health partners; embedding activities in a Two-Eyed Seeing framework that promotes and centres Indigenous languages and ways of knowing, being, and doing from Inuit, Innu, Mi'kmaq, and Wolastoqey perspectives; facilitating the implementation of Indigenous knowledge(s) and support for Indigenous health research in post-secondary institutions; and, creating a supportive environment that welcomes, encourages, and builds capacity for Indigenous trainees.

Through an innovative and ambitious program to advance Indigenous health research, the AIM Network is creating space for Two-Eyed Seeing, on-the-land learning, and reconciliatory and transformative research and education. It seeks to foster a safe and collaborative learning environment in Indigenous health research and to decolonize health professional programs and institutions."

Due to improved treatment options, the mortality rate from CRC continues to decline for both men and women. Despite increased survivorship, treatments can cause persistent and severe long-term symptoms, such as fatigue, bowel and urinary dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, and emotional distress, which can reduce quality of life (QOL). Unfortunately, there is little to no information about symptom problems and how long-term CRC survivors manage their side effects. This can negatively affect survivorship care planning. Survivorship care plans are considered an important element of cancer patient care, and typically include treatment summaries and a follow-up care plan. To shed more light on these issues, Dr. Tae Hart is proposing a knowledge dissemination workshop to promote the information she has collected on the long-term impact of cancer treatments on CRC survivors 10-years post-diagnosis. Dr. Hart's knowledge dissemination grant has two main aims. The first aim is to invite key stakeholders (e.g., survivors of CRC, CRC patient advocacy organizations, CRC cancer care providers, and family practice healthcare providers) to an interactive workshop to critically discuss the research findings from Dr. Hart's research, and how best to convey these results to the public. The second aim is to discuss how these research findings can be applied to CRC survivorship care planning. Methods to enhance patient-centered care and materials that inform CRC survivors and healthcare providers of long-term treatment effects will be developed. It is also expected that by collaborating with family healthcare providers at the workshop, survivorship care planning will be enhanced, which has the potential to improve healthcare services, patient QOL, and reduce the burden or cancer."

This model does not adequately explain why most MSM manage to consistently practice protected sex. The lack of knowledge on protective factors limits the ability of public health agencies and AIDS service organizations to prevent the spread of HIV. The present study aims to examine how HIV- MSM rely on to reduce their sexual risks. Using a mixed-methods approach, the study will identify protective factors and sexual strategies among MSM that lead to higher or lower sexual risk outcomes.

In addition, of new HIV infections occurring in Canada, 44% occur among MSM; again, a significantly higher number than other groups.  HIV rates in MSM are unacceptably high in Canadian cities, with up to one quarter of MSM infected.  Finally, certain racial and ethnic groups, including Black, Aboriginal, and immigrant and foreign-born populations, may have heightened vulnerability to HIV due to a number of different factors.  Our group (the MSM Working Group) is newly-formed within the CIHR Canadian HIV Trials Network, a national partnership that brings together stakeholders in HIV research and service provision, whose goal is to support and facilitate high-quality HIV research.  Recognizing that there is a significant lack of understanding of the diversity and needs of MSM across Canada, and that MSM continue to be affected and infected by HIV at alarming rates, the MSM Working Group aims: to bring together a collaboration of expert researchers and community members in the field of HIV prevention to identify key research needs; to identify successful local or provincial projects examining HIV prevention in MSM, as well as relevant factors making up completed, important research; to ascertain research priorities in the domain of HIV prevention in MSM; and to formulate a large-scale, nationwide study examining HIV prevention in MSM and formalize a plan to apply for new funding to conduct a large national study.

The goal of this research project is to create an adaptation of GPS program that can be administered to both HIV-negative and HIV-positive gay men, delivered in an individual counselling format. The GPS program will create a team of community members, organizations, agencies, and researchers to run the program in five locations across British Columbia and Ontario.  Our team will conduct interviews with community agencies to determine the possibility of offering the GPS program to all men who have sex with men, regardless of HIV status.  An evaluation of GPS will be completed and based on these results, the team will create a funding application to implement the program widely across Canada. At the end of the project, using our existing national network of community agencies and clinics serving gay men, the team will work to expand the program to communities in multiple regions across most Canadian provinces."

Simultaneously, new medications used to prevent HIV are rapidly changing the context of HIV prevention. Uptake of HIV prevention technologies varies across Canada because of differing provincial policies that affect availability of and access to HIV and STI testing, treatment, and prevention. We hypothesize that as new prevention technologies are deployed, there will be differential effects across sites in terms of: (1) uptake of antiretroviral medication as treatment for HIV-positive MSM, and of pre-exposure prophylaxis as prevention for HIV-negative MSM; (2) risk compensation through decreased use of condoms for anal sex; and (3) increased STI incidence. This multisite study will follow MSM who are at high risk for STIs in Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal semi-annually for 4 years. Recruitment of the sample and baseline data collection will already be completed from the cross-sectional study funded by our CIHR Team Grant. HIV and STI testing will be performed at each time point by study nurses. Participants will complete self-report questionnaires, which will collect data on mental health, access to services, social and community-level variables, and safer sex strategies aside from condom use, in addition to event-level data on recent sexual activity and other variables relevant to HIV prevention, all of which have not been studied using comparable measures across sites. This will be the first ever national, multisite, longitudinal study in this high-risk population. By expanding the work of our CIHR Team Grant into a cohort study, the research team will be better equipped to inform public health policy and develop evidence-based HIV and other STI prevention interventions for MSM in Canada and beyond."

A related problem is the increasing crystal methamphetamine (CM) use among GBM. A robust body of literature supports an association between CM use with bacterial STIs. Among GBM, CM use and STIs are best understood as components of a syndemic, defined as multiple health conditions that cluster and worsen the health of a given population. Despite increasing bacterial STIs and CM use among GBM, little work has examined the modifiable mechanisms that could serve as intervention points in this syndemic for different types of CM use.

The goal of this multiphase biopsychosocial study is to examine CM use and bacterial STIs and promising interventions to intervene in the GBM CM use and STI syndemic. The first phase of the study will be a multi-city biobehavioural study, including both a survey and biomedical testing of bacterial STIs. This study will also identify different classes of CM using GBM.  Second, qualitative interviews will be conducted with different types of CM using GBM to better understand their experiences of both CM use and bacterial STIs, to ask them about their health needs, and to learn which CM interventions would be most feasible and acceptable. Next, we will ask expert panels to identify priority prevention and treatment interventions for GBM in each class. Upon completing this 3-phase study, we will work with our community partners to create or implement the most prioritized interventions to reduce CM use harms and bacterial STIs among GBM. Our team of GBM and CM use researchers brings together experts in large-scale, multicity data collection, CM and multi-substance use, STBBI prevention, and experts in community-based and clinic-based interventions for GBM. Our team is therefore well-placed to translate this study into future intervention research."

This research project investigates how local public health units in Ontario, Canada, are collaborating with civil society organizations to develop and implement novel food policy interventions.  Collaborative policymaking raises important questions regarding processes of governance and decision-making that will be addressed by the following research questions: (1) what are the contextual conditions that enable or constrain the collaborative development of food-related policy; (2) what strategies do civil society actors employ to claim space in public health decision-making, and how are those strategies supported or resisted by public health actors; and (3) how do relevant stakeholders in collaborative policy settings define, measure and evaluate outcomes associated with the policy process.    Qualitative key informant interviews and deliberative dialogues will assist in developing recommendations on processes of policy making for complex problems."

Current estimates suggest that 15% of young Canadians between the ages of 10 and 19 cope with anxiety, depression, addictions or other disorders, while estimates among Aboriginal populations are twice the national average (35%), with addictions and suicide being five to six times the national average. Additionally, the Saskatchewan 2010/2011 Student Health Survey found that First Nations and M√©tis children and youth from low-income, inner-city neighbourhoods of Saskatoon were significantly more likely (17.2%) than city averages to report poor mental health status, depressed mood symptoms, and suicide ideation in the past 12 months. These mental illness and addictions inequities signal a crucial need for focused research among Aboriginal children and youth. The operating principle behind this study is that the resources, knowledge, and capabilities required to address the mental illness and addictions inequalities of Aboriginal children and youth are already present within inner-city contexts and young people themselves. Hidden resources of resilience represent small embers that can, through the intervention of informed strategies, be fanned into flames. These resources need to be identified for the benefit of this population. A mixed-methods approach will be employed. The Child and Youth Resilience Measure (CYRM-28) will be administered to quantitatively identify sources of stress, risk, and resilience. Qualitative stories will also be generated from the most resilient children and youth to determine their successful coping strategies. The results of this research will identify sources of resilience and positive mental health strategies that can inform early intervention theory and policy to promote the mental health and wellness of Aboriginal children and youth in Saskatoon and other Canadian urban contexts."

Through strong collaborations with youth and community partner organizations serving their needs, this 5-year project will: a) develop a needs, strengths, and health assessment map with and for Indigenous youth; b) design and implement culturally informed participatory action research projects that will address key social determinants of health that emerge from the needs assessment maps; and c) identify and evaluate the health and resilience outcomes for participating youth by examining changes over time. While observing variations across sties, it is anticipated that Indigenous youth who participate in action research of this kind will show significant increases on various health and resilience measures. The health related knowledge from this project will also: 1) inform effective Indigenous youth engagement strategies; 2) improve social determinants of health impacting Indigenous youth in urban contexts; and 3) guide effective program and policy interventions promoting greater health equity for Indigenous youth across Canada."
"A rapid review of the effects of epidemics or pandemics on suicide, suicidal behaviours and suicidal thoughts","['Hatcher, Simon']","['Guaiana, Giuseppe', 'Heisel, Marnin J', 'Links, Paul S', 'Sinyor, Mark', 'Tippett, Marisa']","['Mental Health', 'Rapid Review', 'Suicide', 'Suicide Behaviour', 'Suicide Prevention']",49987.0,425047,"Suicide remains one of the most important public health challenges worldwide, with more than 800,000 people dying every year. The effect of the pandemic, including physical distancing measures, on suicides and suicidal behaviors remains unclear. This proposal aims to gather and present all available evidence for the effect of infectious pandemics on suicide, suicidal behavior and suicidal thoughts. This rapid review will answer the question ""in a population exposed to an infectious epidemic or pandemic, what is the effect on suicides, suicidal behavior and suicidal thinking both during and after the pandemic"". The review will consider this question across all age groups; between men and women; within indigenous populations; those in lower socioeconomic classes; those with pre-existing health conditions (including mental illnesses); and those who have been infected with Covid-19. The review will include all articles found in several electronic databases using predetermined search terms and will be continuously updated. These will be studies published in peer-reviewed journals which address mental health outcomes in an epidemic or pandemic. Papers will not include research related to the epidemic of suicide. 

Using this review, we hope to provide policymakers with high quality evidence for suicide prevention planning during pandemics. We will also use the review to modify existing guidelines on suicide prevention to be appropriate during times of pandemics and physical distancing. Also, we propose to use this review as a first step in creating a suicide prevention rapid synthesis team with our knowledge users to create ""evidence on tap"". We will create a governance group with our knowledge users to oversee the generation and answering of questions related to Covid-19 and suicide. The review will inform planning for a strategic plan for suicide and Covid-19 research."
Exploring the Development of Biologically-Weighted Multi-Pollutant Exposure Surfaces for the Evaluation of Air Pollution Health Effects,"['Hatzopoulou, Marianne', 'Goldberg, Mark S', 'Joseph, Lawrence', 'Weichenthal, Scott A']","['Chen, Hong', 'Kwong, Jeffrey C', 'Miller, Eric J']","['Air Pollution', 'Cardiovascular Health', 'Population Exposure', 'Urban Transportation']",301589.0,316350,"Population-based studies of the health effects of air pollution increasingly rely on exposure surfaces to assign exposures to large numbers of study participants. Such surfaces are available for a growing list of air pollutants through satellite technology and other models; however, evaluating the integrated health effects of multi-pollutant exposures remains a challenge. To address this need, we propose the development of biologically weighted multi-pollutant exposure surfaces that combine multiple air pollutants and health effects. For example, relevant mechanisms for cardiovascular health may include changes in blood pressure. Through this approach, a single surface is developed that reflects the expected impact of air pollution mixtures on specific physiological effects across a given geographical area. We also aim to integrate these surfaces within a transportation model allowing us to capture the traffic-related air pollution and health effects of transport policy scenarios at a metropolitan scale."

Opioids are strong pain medicines that are used to treat low back pain. Low back pain is one of the most common reasons for a first opioid prescription. Although intended for short-term use, up to 14% of patients newly prescribed opioids for back pain become long-term users (including potential for opioid misuse and addiction). There is limited research looking at how first opioid prescription impacts a person's transition from use for short-term pain to long-term use. 

We will study patients presenting with back pain to the emergency department. We will describe opioid use through analysis of participant and health system data and identify subgroups of people with low back pain who have different patterns of opioid use and pain intensity. We will also collect and integrate individual experiences and perspectives with what is known about opioid use and misuse. We will work with our knowledge user co-applicants and collaborators to inform appropriate acute pain management by identifying individual, environmental, and treatment characteristics for early identification of individuals at risk of long-term opioid use.

Our multidisciplinary team brings expertise in the low back pain field, addictions research and psychology, lived patient experience, health services and qualitative research, healthcare policy, regulatory college administration, and clinical management of low back pain patients. This project will assess patterns and risk factors of prolonged opioid use following low back pain management at the emergency department and will provide a more in-depth understanding of patient experiences of long-term opioid use."
Investigation of Gastrointestinal Adverse Events of Brand Versus Generic Osteoporosis Medications: Merits and Limitations of Different Non-Experimental Research Methods,"['Hayes, Kaleen N']",['N/A'],"['Comparative Effectiveness Research', 'Drug Safety', 'Epidemiologic Methods', 'Gastrointestinal Health', 'Osteoporosis', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Pharmacovigilance']",105000.0,404054,"Osteoporosis is a condition of brittle bone which makes patients susceptible to fractures. Over 2 million Canadians are affected by osteoporosis. The bisphosphonate (BP) class of medications is widely used today for osteoporosis treatment and prevention. Medication adherence is imperative for patients taking BP, as every osteoporosis fracture is estimated to cost the Canadian healthcare system 17,000 dollars. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) complaints, such as heartburn and ulcers, are the most common reason for BP discontinuation. Generic formulations of BP, which are preferred by most insurances due to lower costs, do not have identical disintegration properties as their brand counterparts because of differences in inactive ingredients; these differences have led to inquiries about the GI safety of generic BP. Previous studies have shown that patients taking generic BP had higher rates of drug discontinuation and GI endoscopies than patients taking brand BP. However, previous studies included too few patients to obtain precise results, examined outcomes which are not reliably recorded in databases, or compared groups which had different baseline risks for GI conditions. The proposed research will describe characteristics of over 500,000 new BP users over time in Ontario; compare the rates of GI side effects between brand versus generic BP using three different non-experimental study designs; and compare results, strengths, and limitations of the designs for educational purposes. In addition to informing whether public drug formularies should include brand BP or enforce better evidence of safety of generic oral BP prior to market entry, findings will help to educate a variety of stakeholders (e.g., clinicians, policy-makers) on the implementation and interpretation of these designs."

Child Health and the Environment is quite a new topic in Canada. People need to know about research that has been done.

We will hold a Cafe Scientifique in Edmonton. In this event, the public and the experts will talk about pollution and its effects on children's health. People will learn where children may be exposed to pollution. They will learn which are most harmful exposures. There will be conversations on how to protect children from the sources of pollution. We will encourage a friendly exchange of questions, answer and concerns.

The cafe will invite the public, parents, students, and health workers. We will attract interest using flyers, posters, emails and internet. Through all these, we hope to set up a group with an interest on children's environmental health. We expect this group will stay in touch after the cafe."

Our specific aims are first to test a conceptual model of outcomes linking characteristics of the sexual abuse experienced (duration, severity and identity of the perpetrator) with classic post-traumatic stress symptoms (re-experiencing symptoms, avoidance and hyperarousal) and complex post-traumatic symptoms (for instance, alterations in social relations, in regulation of affects and in self-perceptions). The longitudinal design of the study will allow for the exploration of distinctive trajectories of symptoms over a 24-month period after disclosure: chronic difficulties, delayed response to trauma, recovery and resilience. Our research program will also test the influence of two variables that may impact on symptoms over time: the child's coping strategies and the child's perception of security in regards to their relationhips with caregivers.  Questionnaires will be administered to children (6-12 years) and their mothers who are consulting following disclosure in five different facilities offering services to children victims of sexual abuse. This research plan will generate reliable and useful data to better understand the complex phenomenon of child sexual abuse and to provide needed cues for the design of efficient intervention programs. Documentation of consequences of sexual victimization will provide crucial information to health planning agencies in terms of needed services.

Uncovering Pathways to Recovery and Optimizing Treatment for Child and Adolescent Victims of Sexual Abuse,"['H√©bert, Martine']",['N/A'],"['Interpersonal Violence', 'Mental Health', 'Resilience', 'Sexual Abuse', 'Treatment']",755346.0,333410,"Child sexual abuse (CSA) is an important public health problem with recent estimates showing that one in five women and one in ten men report being sexually abused before the age of 18. CSA is associated with an increased risk for mental health disorders, alcohol and drug abuse, criminality and suicide as well as adverse physical health symptoms. The inter-generational transmission of CSA and the link with later traumas (e.g. victimization in the context of romantic relationships) underscore the need for early identification and implementation of efficient strategies to break the cycle of violence. 

The proposed research program aims to address current gaps in the scientific literature concerning the mechanisms linking CSA and mental health outcomes. Our program will also test the incremental value of relying on a tailored approach to foster recovery in all victims of CSA, compared to the 'one-size-fits-all' current approach. The objectives are to: 1) disentangle the diversity of mental health profiles in victims of CSA and identify key predictors (e.g. emotion regulation) that contribute prospectively to health outcomes; and 2) implement and assess the effectiveness of a modular approach based on the most renowned evidence-based therapy to treat CSA victims (Trauma Focused-Cognitive Behavioral Therapy - TF-CBT).

This research program will contribute to knowledge on theoretical models of recovery in children and youth. Documentation of the consequences of CSA will provide crucial information to health planning agencies in terms of needed services. The program will also offer a unique opportunity to implement a personalized, patient-centered approach to treatment for CSA children and youth in Canada. Such an approach could be associated with a substantial reduction in health costs and significantly reduce the risks of morbidity among this vulnerable population."

I have been a collaborator on the only TB project in the initiative, which has been ongoing for over four years. This project involves two high TB incidence communities in Northwestern Saskatchewan (1 reserve community and 1 northern village) and two high TB incidence communities in Northeastern Alberta (1 reserve community, and 1 city), that are connected to one another historically, linguistically and culturally. 

The objectives of our project are to 1) figuratively dismantle the colonially rooted jurisdictional boundaries that separate the communities and confound TB control and, 2) build a new relationship between the programmatic (government) stakeholders, and the communities. The goal of this partnership is to establish the communities as equal partners in any decision making that pertains to TB prevention and care at the local level.

Central to the project is a coalition of all stakeholders (government, community members, and other) that functions as an ethical space for dialogue. It is held to account by unanimous agreement to respect the rights of Indigenous peoples as articulated in the Charter (the Patients Charter for Tuberculosis Care), UNDRIP (the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples), and the TRC (Truth and Reconciliation Commission) Report. 

A panel is planned that opens a dialogue between the researchers (including myself), and two of our community partners centered around the theme of human rights. Our aim is to address three or four specific human rights issues/questions that the project raises, or honours. This panel is on the agenda for the 23rd annual meeting of the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease, North America Region in Vancouver, BC on February 21-23rd, 2019."

Consequences of violence experiences at any age include mood and anxiety symptoms and a sense of betrayal and mistrust in others. Trust is the foundation for human interaction and is necessary for physical and mental health. Oxytocin (OT) is a brain chemical that is involved in reproduction, trust and stress responses. Animal studies that explored OT in relation to stress and affiliation found significant sex differences in biological and behavioural responses. However, the applicability of animal data to human social behaviours and stress responses is not clear. There are significant gaps in our understanding of OT and its role in affiliation and trust, although there is evidence that we need to look at this separately in men and women. OT is beginning to be used as a treatment for mental disorders, without taking into consideration gender differences and clear evidence of its efficacy. To help address these gaps, we will examine the relationship between OT and trust in women who have had violence experiences and those that have not while controlling for the many variables that may influence levels of trust and levels of OT in women. We will use a single interview, questionnaires and one blood sample to investigate the relationship between OT levels and trust. If OT has any clinical application for stress-related symptoms, studies with women will allow us to further understand the relationships between OT, trust and women's biological and behavioural responses to violence experiences. From such data, new and targeted clinical uses could be developed. It is likely that no single intervention would address the full impact of violence on women's mental health, but OT may show promise as an addition to the repertoire of interventions."
The relationship between early childhood trauma and comorbid physical illness and somatic symptoms in adult depression,"['Helleman, Amanda R']",['N/A'],"['Adults', 'Depression', 'Early Childhood Trauma', 'Physical Illness', 'Psychopathology', 'Risk Factors', 'Somatic Symptoms']",17500.0,199999,"Early life events sensitize neuronal pathways in the brain, which increase responses to later stressors and the risk for the development of mental illnesses, such as depression. In addition to impairing a person's cognitive and behavioural functioning, depression is also associated with increased physical illness and somatic symptoms. As part of my M.A. research, I am interested in exploring how early life adverse experiences relate to the development of comorbid physical illness and somatic symptoms in adults with depression. Previous research has demonstrated that traumatic events in childhood such as abuse are linked to adult-onset depression. It has also been found that depression is associated with higher rates of chronic diseases such as high blood pressure and coronary heart disease, as well as somatic complaints such as chronic headaches. It is, however, unknown whether specific types of early stressors may be predictive of certain health related illnesses and somatic symptoms commonly found in depression. This link may help explain the vast differences between physical symptoms experienced by depressed patients, and provide further evidence to the contribution early stressors have on the dysregulation of specific neurological mechanisms. Should the initial study provide promising results, then it is my intention to conduct a more detailed study assessing whether inflammatory immune factors (e.g. c-reactive protein, cytokines), which have been associated with stressor experiences, major depression and physical illness, act as mediators between early experiences and the development of health pathologies."

Most people living in Canada over the age of 15 use alcohol, one in six report use of psychoactive pharmaceuticals, one in five use cannabis, and a smaller proportion report using cocaine or crack, ecstasy, speed, and/or hallucinogens. Unfortunately, stigma associated with substance use remains one of the greatest barriers to individuals seeking treatment or support for substance use, particularly among individuals who identify as a member of an equity-deserving group (e.g., Indigenous, Black, female, LGBTQ2S+). Stigma is also a barrier to care for first responders, health care professionals, and academics; intersectionality further amplifies health and wellness disparities. While physical health and mental health are understood to rest on a continuum or spectrum, with multiple supports for lifelong wellness, substance use is often used as a synonym for addiction/substance use disorder (SUD). This stereotype often frames substance use in and of itself as an acute disorder, which it is not. Reframing substance use under the umbrella of substance use health focuses on self-defined wellness goals and multiple pathways of recovery. Embracing  substance use health and truly transforming research, clinical practice, and policy requires a paradigm shift in our conceptualization of substance use and addiction. Our aim is to bring together diverse researchers, clinicians, and policymakers, alongside experts with lived/living experience, together for a one-day symposium in order to learn from differing perspectives on this topic and ultimately carve out a path for the future of substance use health among all people living in Canada."

Negative, stigmatizing attitudes are found throughout society - in the general public, within the families and social circles of people with mental illness, among healthcare professionals, and among youth. Since most mental health problems begin in adolescence and persist into adulthood, early access to services has the potential of long-term benefits for vulnerable youth. However, only 25-30% of youth in need access specialized treatment, and stigma is one of the key reasons youth choose not to seek services. There have been calls for increased research to understand aspects of youth mental health stigma, ideally through qualitative and quantitative research with stakeholder engagement. This project is a direct response to such calls. Working with youth as full partners in the project, this study will identify the aspects and sources of stigma that are considered to be the greatest barriers to service seeking among youth with mental health and/or substance use challenges. By doing so, this project will guide researchers, anti-stigma interventionists, investors, and policymakers interested in working toward a stigma-free Canada in which youth and their caregivers are empowered to reach out for services that could benefit the youth. Analyses will identify anti-stigma priorities for youth with diverse levels of mental health service need, across genders, and for Anglophone and Francophone communities. The results will lead not only to clear research agendas to advance stigma reduction, but also direct implementation guidance ensuring that investments are being channeled into the aspects of stigma with the most potential to break down the barriers preventing youth from seeking the services they need."

We have already surveyed 622 youth and produced preliminary results; funding will enable us to track the experience of these youth for a year. 2) We will conduct interviews with youth over 9 months to further understand impacts over time. 3) Based on each wave of findings, we will partner with our Youth Engagement Initiative to develop innovative materials and interventions to address expressed youth needs. 4) We will conduct participatory action research summits in Ontario and British Columbia to mobilize the perspectives and voices of youth with MHSU concerns to examine youth-designed pandemic response materials, plan for future pandemic responses, and collect any further insights about the pandemic's impacts. This rapid-response study provides high-quality, real-time evidence to support the management of youth MHSU impacts of COVID-19 via a patient-oriented research approach. By collecting and immediately responding to youths' recommendations regarding the clinical, health, and public health responses that would be most meaningful to them, this study will inform MHSU pandemic decision-making and planning within Canada."
"Truth, Reconciliation, and Mobilizing for Health Equity within Academic Medicine","['Henderson, Rita I']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1040.0,364622,"In 2015, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRCC) published its final report and calls to action for Canadian society to redress the harms of the country's Indian Residential Schools system. For a century and a half, these institutions fulfilled federal government policy to assimilate Indigenous children by removing them from their families and communities. Today, the TRCC directs attention to clear principles around reconciliation, in hopes that through the work of institutions and governments responding to the calls, relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Canadians may be healed. However, the TRCC stops short of detailing how to achieve meaningful change. This article outlines efforts by stakeholders in one medical school to mobilize their institution around this task. The Critical Collaborative Consensus-Building Process (3CBP) described here models a decolonizing, anti-racist, and Indigenous praxis, offering insight for academic and non-academic entities alike, on how they might move structures for improved equity in a timely and cost-effective fashion.  The authors highlight that institutions of higher education are socially accountable to the communities that they teach and serve, making them key players in developing strategies for a cultural shift within privileged spaces. Unravelling the social and political forces that perpetuate inequities requires attention for local complexities and clear strategies for navigating discomfort."
The Effects of In Utero and Neonatal Wildfire Smoke Exposure on Birth Outcomes and Health in Early Life,"['Henderson, Sarah']","['Gan, Wenqi', 'Kosatsky, Tom', 'Lavigne, √âric', 'Luke, Sabrina', 'Weichenthal, Scott A']","['Administrative Health Data', 'Air Pollution', 'Birth Outcomes', 'Early Life Outcomes', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Exposure During Pregnancy', 'Exposure Modelling', 'Population-Based Study', 'Wildfire Smoke']",325124.0,408912,"The 2017 and 2018 wildfire seasons were the worst in the history of British Columbia (BC). In both seasons, more than 1.2 million hectares of land were burned, and approximately 200 million tons of wildfire smoke were emitted. Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations were elevated throughout the province for several weeks. A small number of studies conducted in other regions suggest that such extreme smoke-related PM2.5 exposures may affect unborn and newborn infants, but no studies have been conducted in Canada. This project will take advantage of the extreme 2017 and 2018 wildfire seasons and the milder 2016 and 2019 wildfire seasons to investigate how wildfire smoke exposure affects birth outcomes and risk of diseases in the first year of life. Specifically, all BC infants who were in the womb or born during the summers of 2016-2019 (approximately 200,000 in total) will be grouped into those with low, moderate, or high wildfire smoke exposure using an existing PM2.5 model. Birth outcomes and adverse health outcomes in the first year of life will then be compared across the three groups using administrative databases. The birth outcomes will include stillbirths, birth defects, preterm births, term low birth weight, small for gestational age, and full-term birth weight. The adverse health outcomes will include non-accidental deaths, respiratory diseases, congenital heart defects not identified at birth, ear infections, and antibiotic prescriptions. Based on previous literature we hypothesize that infants who were more exposed to wildfire smoke will have worse birth outcomes and higher risks of adverse health outcomes in the first year of life when compared with infants who were less exposed. This project will provide important new knowledge to better understand the health impacts of wildfire smoke for pregnant women and newborn infants and will inform public health and medical practitioners to better prepare for future wildfire events."

The network will look to advance Indigenous health and well-being within transdisciplinary approaches that focus on survivance as a framework (survival, resistance, and resurgence) to comprehend the impacts of contact with colonial systems, as well as the growing field of digital technologies, and ethical data governance. Due to the vast array of Indigenous knowledges, this NEIHR will center the concept of survivance as a framework to engage in health research nationally and globally, by challenging ongoing settler colonialism, and engaging in de/anti/post-colonial health research. Despite differences in the histories of colonization, Indigenous peoples globally share common impacts related to the micro and macro colonial violence that they have experienced, which has negatively impacted their well-being. Despite historical/contemporary violences and subsequent intergenerational traumas, Indigenous peoples continue to survive and resist in the every day, while Indigenous knowledges are reshaping  broader academic spaces. To best understand the needs of Indigenous communities, SoSN will encourage community-engaged research practices built on ethical relational accountability to guide research objectives in an effort to develop real time change. Finally, SoSN will look to move beyond two-eyed seeing to a third space of health research in an effort to encourage reconciliatory health research nationally and globally."

Prenatal programming of child neurodevelopment and mental health problems,"['Hentges, Rochelle F']",['N/A'],"['Developmental Cascade Models', 'Genetic Markers', 'Longitudinal Cohort Study', 'Mediation', 'Mental Health', 'Moderation', 'Neurocognitive Functioning', 'Parenting', 'Prenatal Stress', 'Temperament']",90000.0,396810,"More than 1 in 4 children in Canada show delays in at least one area of development by school entry. Current research indicates that prenatal stress is a significant risk factor for child mental health and neurocognitive problems. It is estimated that close to two-thirds of women experience a significant stressor in the year prior to an infant's birth. Thus, at birth, many infants may have already been exposed to risk factors that can affect their health and well-being. As a result, provincial health campaigns (e.g., Alberta's Ready or Not campaign) highlight maternal mental health and stress as one of the key areas to improve before and during pregnancy. However, it is still unclear why and how prenatal stress affects child mental health and cognitive development (e.g., language skills). In addition, the association between prenatal stress and child health outcomes vary between studies. This suggests that some individuals or populations of individuals may be at greater or lesser risk than others. Accordingly, this study will use a large, longitudinal pregnancy cohort based in Alberta, Canada to examine two main aims. First, will we examine a cascade of events between pregnancy and child age 5 to examine how prenatal stress impacts the parent, child, and family over time. Our second aim will be to examine whether certain genetic markers increase or decrease the risks associated with prenatal stress. The results of this study will inform preventative intervention efforts aimed at promoting both maternal mental health and child well-being. Identifying how prenatal stress impacts maternal, child, and family well-being across early childhood can help intervention programs determine which areas to target during specific time periods (e.g., prenatal, infancy, toddlerhood). Identifying genes that promote risk will allow us to classify individuals who are most susceptible to the negative effects of prenatal stress, an important goal of precision medicine."
Maternal depression and child mental health: Role of emotion-processing and childcare.,"['Herba, Catherine M']","['C√¥t√©, Sylvana', 'Seguin, Jean R']","['Child Care', 'Child Emotional Development', 'Child Mental Health', 'Depression And Anxiety', 'Emotion-Processing', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Intervention', 'Maternal Depression', 'Prevention', 'Prospective Study']",100000.0,246563,"Depression is common in women of childbearing age and represents a huge cost to the health care system. Also troubling, is that children of depressed mothers are at risk for developing long term emotional problems such as symptoms of depression and anxiety. Little is known on how these children become at increased risk, and what we can do to protect them. We first aim to gain a better understanding of these questions by examining how these children process emotional information. Emotion-processing, such as the ability to read facial expressions, is important for social development and interaction. We want to see if children of depressed mothers focus more on negative emotions and less on happy expressions, increasing their risk for later emotional problems. Second, research shows that childcare (eg; daycare) may be protective for children of high-risk families such as those growing up in poverty or exposed to maternal depression. Yet we do not know how childcare may be protective for children of depressed mothers. Childcare reduces a child's exposure to their mother's depression but it may also provide them with a wider range of social interactions that fosters their ability to process emotional information. We will address these questions by building on a longitudinal study of children with extensive evaluations of maternal depression, early childcare, and child mental health. We propose to process data we are gathering on these children and their families at 7-8 years, and to follow them up again at 9-10 years using detailed measures of emotion-processing, self/parent/teacher assessments of child emotional problems, and maternal depression. A better understanding of how children process emotional information along with detailed information on maternal depression and childcare use will help to clarify how children of depressed mothers are at risk for emotional problems. Findings could also have implications for childcare policy, reaching many Canadian families."

A mother's SDA in pregnancy is associated with poorer child behavioural, cognitive and language outcomes, even after accounting for her postnatal SDA and inherited influences. Yet, little is known on how SDA in pregnancy affects the child. Although various processes likely play a role, it is relevant to study the body's stress response system: the glucocorticoid (GC) signaling pathway. When a mother experiences stress, she produces cortisol. Elevated SDA may render the placenta less able to protect the fetus against harmful effects of cortisol. The fetus' developing stress response system may be compromised, increasing the child's vulnerability to stress later in life. To date, most evidence comes from animal studies and human studies have only examined parts of this process in small samples. Careful examination of this pathway is needed to understand its significance in humans. We will use data from a pregnancy cohort and biobank to study associations between maternal SDA, GC biomarkers in mothers, placenta and newborns and child outcomes in over 1000 mothers and their babies. Mothers reported on their SDA at each pregnancy trimester and postnatally. At birth, placenta samples and mother and newborn hair samples were obtained. We will use hair cortisol concentration since it can capture biological stress response in mothers and fetuses in the last months of pregnancy. Placental function can be assessed by measuring expression and activity of a key enzyme and expression of GC gene receptors. Mothers rated their child's behaviour at 2 years. Children also completed tests for motor, cognitive and language development. This study is very well setup to improve our understanding of how maternal SDA may influence early child development. This is critical to determine for whom and when support or intervention to mother or child is most needed."

Much of the research on active transportation and public spaces has focused on larger urban centres leaving smaller cities with questions about what strategies and lessons apply to them as they develop their own action plans. In addition, active transportation initiatives and research often shows the greatest health benefits for those who already experience health advantages due to their income, education, age and access to resources. This demonstrates the need for an equity lens in the process of planning public space initiatives and research that promotes health for all. Seeking to address these gaps the goal of this planning grant is to situate the city of Brandon, Manitoba, as a model city for active transportation and public space initiatives in the context of other smaller cities and develop collaborative approaches to ensuring meaningful health impacts through an equity lens. The collaborative project has four objectives: 1) enhance collaboration and communication among stakeholder groups; 2) look at the transferability and application of best practices from Copenhagen taking into account who lives in Brandon and what is the nature of the city; 3) co-develop a demonstration project and a process for evaluating successful active transportation initiatives through a series of stakeholder engagement events; 4) host a conference to share knowledge and develop a research team for a future CIHR project grant.

This research will use data collected from 3000 women who were enrolled during pregnancy and followed up over time. We will look at whether social support can help protect against PPD for specific groups of women who are particularly at risk due to their social or demographic characteristics. We will examine which elements of social support are most beneficial in protecting against PPD, whether it be the ability to confide in someone, or the ability to ask someone for specific support (like help with babysitting).  We will also look at what types of women are able to improve their levels of social support over time, and what context enables them to do that, whether it be access to mom and baby programs, or other community resources. This research will help us identify who is most at risk for PPD, and what kinds of support are most important for them.

Investigating the Influence of Immigration and Ethnicity in Predicting Suicide Risk among Mentally-Ill Patients,"['Hettige, Nuwan']",['N/A'],"['Ics Travel Awards', 'Immigration', 'Mental Health', 'Population Health', 'Suicide']",806.0,346199,"Suicide is a major public health concern which ranks among the leading causes of death in Canada. Unfortunately many individuals that attempt suicide often suffer from mental illness. Many previous studies have demonstrated that individuals who have immigrated to Canada or who are of a minority ethnic group face an increased risk for developing a mental illness. This increased risk is strongly attributable to the unique stressors associated with settling in an unfamiliar country and being viewed as a minority citizen. In addition to the difficulties of living with a mental illness, these stressors may increase the risk for suicide among this population. My study is the first to investigate whether immigration and ethnicity are significant risk factors that should be considered when evaluating suicide risk among mentally-ill patients. Among a cohort of 380 schizophrenia and schizoaffective-depressive patients recruited for this study, we collected clinical information including self-identified ethnicity, migration history, and suicidal behaviour. Cross-sectional clinical assessments were done using psychiatric self-report and interview questions. My analysis demonstrates trends in suicidal behaviour between visible minority and Caucasian patients. Immigrants also show a significantly earlier age of onset for psychosis compared to non-migrant patients. These results confirm the increased susceptibility for schizophrenia among the immigrant population and the risk for suicide among minority groups. Current citizenship practices in Canada require that migrants undergo a series of medical examinations upon their arrival. I suggest that similarly, mental health evaluations be conducted for the first few years following arrival. By focusing on migrants and refugees (who may have escaped conflict zones), physicians may be able to identify early signs of mental deterioration and prevent the risk of suicide in these individuals through early intervention."

2)Examine how policies aimed at reducing poverty and gender inequality in high- and low-income countries impact major causes of illness and injury in children and women under 45.
3)Examine the relationship between social policies and other public health and medical care policies targeting reducing death, illness and injury among children and women under 45.

In carrying out this work, this program will focus on four substantive areas which have been set as priorities by the UN and World Health Organization for children and women under 45 years of age: 1) infant (under one year old) and child mortality (under 5 years old); 2) maternal mortality; 3) HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis; and 4) mental health."

One of the main gaps in addressing these inequities is the lack of high-quality population health data available to policy makers. The lack of reliable data creates a barrier for evidence-based culturally informed health policy and program development.

Our Health Counts (OHC) is an innovative model designed to address the gap in data on urban Indigenous health and social data. The proposed project will adapt the OHC model for application in two cities in NB. The goal of OHC NB is to develop a baseline population health database for urban Indigenous people living in Fredericton and Saint John, NB. 

We will use a community-based participatory research methodology to ensure that Indigenous stakeholders are involved in all aspects of the research and that results directly benefit the communities involved. We will recruit 500 Indigenous adults and 250 Indigenous children living in or near Fredericton and Saint John using Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS). We will collect data through a 'respectful health survey' that will be created with the urban Indigenous community, and through administrative data linkages at the NB Institute for Research Data and Training (NBIRDT). Results will be shared widely with stakeholders.

The proposed research will build on a successful model for measuring urban Indigenous health status and create a culturally relevant and community owned population health database. This database will help to fill a gap in knowledge about the health of urban Indigenous people in NB and provide a stronger evidence base for health program and policy development. The research will also increase capacity and leadership in NB for community-driven Indigenous population health research through strengthened partnerships and training for students, post-docs, and early career researchers."

Canadians see more wildfire smoke yearly, which creates air pollution that harms lung health. The harms of air pollution are worse for children because they are growing, active, and spend more time outdoors. Pollutants like wildfire smoke trigger dangerous asthma attacks and worsen sleep. 

About one in ten Canadian children has asthma. In addition to becoming dangerous medical emergencies, asthma attacks can keep children out of school, parents from work, and cost Canadians more than a billion healthcare dollars a year. Children with asthma are more likely to get sick from air pollution than children without asthma. 

Staying indoors is one way that people can protect themselves from wildfire smoke, but only if indoor air is clean. Indoor air chemicals come from outside air and from household sources like vacuuming, cooking, scented products, and gas appliances. 

This research project will look how air pollution affects children and what we can do about it. Part one will examine how air quality, smoke, and other exposures coincide with asthma attacks to help us understand environmental factors that make them better (being near to green spaces) and worse (being near smoke or heavy traffic). Part two looks at how the air chemicals children breathe are absorbed by their body (measured by checking for these chemicals in their urine), what the effects are on their lung function, and if cleaning air in children's bedrooms changes the chemicals we see in their urine. Part three will look at whether air purifiers help take worrisome chemicals out of school air, and if using these air purifiers long-term is feasible for teachers and schools. 

Children who are exposed to pollution are at risk of lifelong health damage, and the risk of these exposures will only get worse with continued climate change. We need to know how to protect our indoor air in ways that protect children's health."

Clients engaging in LBIs at Indigenous-led treatment facilities may have higher rates of adverse childhood experiences (i.e., ACEs, or experiences of abuse, neglect, and/or household dysfunction before the age of 18) because rates of ACEs have been found to be higher for populations with substance use disorders (SUDs) compared to populations without, and for Indigenous populations compared to non-Indigenous populations. Little research is available outlining how LBIs support positive mental health outcomes specifically for Indigenous individuals with SUDs and high ACEs. More research is also needed to understand facilitators and challenges that exist around long-term inclusion of LBIs into treatment programs and communities. The present line of research addresses these gaps via three studies. In Study 1, survey responses from clients attending a substance use treatment facility for Indigenous clients will be gathered to understand how ACEs impact one's motivation to engage with LBIs during treatment. In Study 2, interviews with service providers and clients from the same treatment facility will be collected and summarized to understand how client ACEs impact outcomes of LBIs during treatment and what facilitators and challenges exist when including LBIs in treatment. In Study 3, national population level data will be analyzed to understand how social determinants of health (e.g., housing, income) impact participation in LBIs at the community level. The various perspectives gathered will provide a better understanding of how LBIs can support healing for Indigenous populations with SUDs and ACEs, as well as how to ensure the accessibility and availability of LBIs in treatment programs and communities. Findings will also inform public policy regarding resource allocation for mental health supports."

Although studies have found that children whose parents have chronic pain may be at risk for developing pain themselves, few studies have addressed how this relationship occurs. One possible explanation is social modeling, which suggests that children learn to display pain behaviours from their parents. Another explanation is that chronic pain affects parenting practices, which in turn affect children's experiences of pain. No research has studied these explanations in children of parents with chronic pain or examined whether these parents respond differently to their children's pain compared to healthy parents. In the proposed study, parents and their children will complete quantitative sensory testing (QST), which examines sensitivity to pain. Half of the parents in the study will have chronic pain and the other half will be healthy and pain-free. Parents will complete the QST alone and then observe their children completing the same tasks. Parents and children will be videotaped and their displays of pain and conversations will be examined. Parents and children will also work together on problem-solving tasks, and their behaviour will be examined to determine the parenting practices that parents use. It is expected that the children of parents with chronic pain will experience more pain than the other children, and that parents with chronic pain will spend more time talking to their children about pain and less time talking about other topics during the QST compared to parents without chronic pain. It is expected that lower levels of parental positive involvement with their children and higher amounts of coercive discipline will be related to children experiencing more pain during the pain tasks. This study will help researchers learn more about pain in children of parents with chronic pain and why they are at greater risk of developing pain problems than other children."

Persistence of Vision: Masculinities and Young Men's Mental Health,"['Hilario, Carla T']",['N/A'],['Mental Health'],2499.0,337267,"Persistence of vision refers to the optical illusion in film whereby distinct images blend in the human mind to create a single moving image. In the same vein, multiple frameworks for masculinities may be perceived to coalesce and collapse into one dominant discourse on how to 'be a man'. This presentation shares findings from a collaborative inquiry study, which explores connections between social context and mental health among young men from migrant backgrounds. Drawing on the concept of social context and informed by an intersectional lens, there is a focus on the ways in which everyday experiences related to mental health and emotional distress are shaped by racialization, migration policies and representations of masculinities.   

Based in a western Canadian urban area, the project is guided by an advisory group, comprised of service providers and community leaders in the area who work with young people; and by six young men (ages 15-21), from migrant backgrounds, who served as research collaborators during data collection, analysis and knowledge dissemination. Data collection methods included fieldwork, informal and formal in-depth interviews, and 'go-along' interview methods. Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. The research collaborators provided guidance on sampling and recruitment strategies, interview questions, data interpretation and led the design and production of a short film based on the narratives of 30 young men who took part in in-depth one-on-one and/or group interviews. Data analysis is inspired by narrative analysis methods and informed by theories of social context, subjectivities, gender relations and masculinities. 

This presentation shares findings from the study, considers implications for generating inclusive dialogue around youth mental health and shines a light on the everyday experiences of young men against the backdrop of dominant representations of masculinities, migrants and mental health in contemporary Canada."

This has led to the realization that zoonotic diseases, particularly those associated with wildlife, pose a significant threat to human health. People living in cities are at increased risk for certain zoonotic diseases because the urban environment creates an opportunity for close contact between humans and certain wildlife species, most notably rats. Rats have been, and continue to be, the source of a number of important zoonotic diseases, e.g., plague and leptospirosis, for people living in cities around the world. Given that over 23 million people currently live in Canada's urban centers (Statistics Canada, 2005), a comprehensive understanding of the risk factors associated with disease transmission from rats to humans is crucial to protect the health of Canadians. However, despite evidence that rats are thriving in cities across Canada, there is a paucity of data on Canadian rat populations and the risks that they may pose to human health. This is problematic because the non-specific illnesses caused by many rat-borne zoonoses can be misdiagnosed if health professionals are unaware of the presence of, and risk factors associated with, these diseases in their jurisdictions. Also, since the distribution and incidence of many rat-borne zoonotic diseases are increasing in association with increased global urbanization, Canadian cities may be vulnerable to future epidemics associated with these diseases if adequate surveillance is not in place. By studying the dynamics of rat-borne zoonoses in Vancouver, we will be able to characterize the human health risks associated with urban rats and to analyze existing and potential surveillance systems for rat-associated disease, allowing us to provide insight into how these systems can be improved to better protect human health, both locally and nationally."

Mother often stop to breastfeed their babies because of little privacy, and the absence of nurses or other people who can help them with breastfeeding.  

Pakistan often faces disasters such as earthquakes and floods. Many young children end up in disaster relief camps and are at a higher risk to die due to migration and the discontinuation of breastfeeding. My research will focus on breastfeeding practices of mothers in the disaster relief camps in Pakistan. During my research in the relief camps, I will find out what leads mothers to continue or stop breastfeeding. I will also observe the situation in the camps and meet with volunteers who work there. This study is a first step to reduce deaths of young children in disaster relief camps in Pakistan.

My research will help relief workers in Canada to improve breastfeeding practices of mothers living in relief camps globally. It will also help in creating plans to promote breastfeeding and decrease deaths of young children.

Unfortunately, the delivery of services to meet the health and social care needs of vulnerable older adults (i.e., those living with a disability and/or chronic health condition) is fragmented, which makes navigating the healthcare and social systems challenging. As a result, vulnerable older adults and their families are not always receiving the care or support needed to optimize their health and wellbeing.  We are proposing to form a  multi-disciplinary team comprised of health care system professionals, representatives from community-based organizations, City of Toronto staff, researchers and other key stakeholders to plan a large-scale approach to make the City of Toronto more age-friendly for vulnerable older adults.  This will involve conducting an environmental scan of existing programs, services and policies in place to support the health and social care needs of vulnerable older adults and their families. Doing so will help to identify areas that can be prioritized for research approaches that will provide the necessary knowledge to streamline available resources to improve outcomes for older vulnerable adults and their families living in the City of Toronto."
Identifying Key Priorities in Housing and Health for People with Physical Disabilities,"['Hitzig, Sander L']","['Athanasopoulos, Peter', 'Best, Krista L', 'Guilcher, Sara J', 'Kaiser, Anita', 'Sheppard, Christine L', 'Yuzwa, Kirstin']","['Housing', 'Modified Delphi Approach', 'Patient Oriented Research', 'Physical Disability']",20000.0,487748,"Having access to appropriate housing is recognized as an important factor in one's ability to maintain good health and wellbeing. For people with a physical disability, finding accessible housing can be challenging. In some cases, people with a disability cannot find affordable housing that meets their needs or may not be able to modify their homes in a way that enables them to maintain their independence. As well, research in accessible housing is lacking in Canada. To address this gap in knowledge, we are proposing to work with people with disabilities and.or professionals in housing accessibility to develop a research agenda on housing and health for people with physical disabilities. This will be accomplished by first identifying what the housing priorities are for people with disabilities. Our team will then plan an event with a diverse set of key interest groups, including people with disabilities, to select the top priorities that will inform a national research agenda on this topic. The outcomes of this work will help build and strengthen relationships of people working in accessible housing, which can lead to new research and practices that will improve the health and wellbeing of people with disabilities."

Investigating the impact of a simple standardized retail nutrition labelling system on the nutritional quality of consumer's food purchases in supermarkets in Canada.,"['Hobin, Erin P', 'Hammond, David G']","['Bollinger, Bryan K', ""L'Abbe, Mary R"", 'Manson, Heather', 'Rosella, Laura C', 'Vanderlee, Lana M']","['Chronic Disease Prevention', 'Health Behaviour Change', 'Longitudinal Data', 'Nutrition Labels', 'Population Health Intervention Research', 'Quasi-Experimental Research Design']",353505.0,292559,"Unhealthy diet is now the leading risk factor for chronic diseases and premature death in Canada. Nutrition labels are the most common source of nutrition information for Canadians and may assist individuals in making more informed, healthier food choices.  However, a recent Health Canada study showed that individuals have difficulty understanding and using nutrition labels. Simple nutrition ratings on shelf tags in supermarkets are a relatively new strategy that provides consumers with easy-to-read ""at a glance"" guidance to help them better understand and use nutrition information. Loblaw, the largest supermarket retailer in Canada, implemented the on-shelf nutrition labelling system ""Guiding Stars"", in Loblaws supermarkets in Ontario in August 2012 and in remaining Loblaw-affiliated supermarkets in Ontario in February 2013. Loblaw-affiliated supermarkets outside of Ontario will receive the program in February 2014. This study will examine the effect of the Guiding Stars nutrition labelling system on the nutritional quality of consumer food purchases in supermarkets in Canada. Methods: First, store-level and individual customer transaction data will be compared over time in supermarkets with and without the Guiding Stars nutrition labelling system. Second, Exit Surveys with supermarket customers will be conducted before and after implementation of the intervention to examine consumer awareness, understanding, trust, and use of the nutrition labelling system. Impact: The proposed research will be the first study in Canada to examine the effect of a large-scale on-shelf nutrition labelling system on the nutritional quality of consumer food purchases in supermarkets. With over 14 million customers per week across Loblaw stores, the findings from this study have tremendous potential to inform nutrition labelling practices and improve the nutritional quality of consumer food purchases in supermarkets in Canada."

This is a genetic disorder which results in an array of symptoms including mental and sensory-motor difficulties. People with Down syndrome are at high risk for obesity and cardiovascular disease as they age and inactivity is a significant risk factor. The acquisition of basic motor skills enables and motivates engagement in activities for life. This program of research is designed to fill a knowledge gap about the action-observation process in people with Down syndrome. The specific aim is to study how these people observe and attend to actions in others in order to facilitate the learning of physical skills. Surprisingly very little is know about how to effectively teach people with Down syndrome motor skills and the processes engaged during observation and motor learning. These individuals appear to learn well from demonstrations, in comparison to mental age matched controls, yet there is evidence from brain imaging studies that this process is different to typically developing individuals, not involving activation of motor-areas of the brain. Further, no one has systematically studied what information drives this observational learning process. During actual movement, there is evidence that people with Down syndrome have difficulties predicting the future effects of their action, in terms of how an action looks and feels. We do not know whether this difficulty extends to the observation process and hence this research will help answer this question through studies requiring the prediction of movement effects when watching others. We will use behavioural methods to study these questions, involving the measurement of responses to demonstrated actions, both in the short term and long-term learning of novel actions. This research will direct evidence-based interventions for the teaching of motor skills and help to promote engagement in physical activity among people with Down syndrome."
National Youth Dialogue on Canada's Role in Global Health and Development,"['Hoffman, Steven J']",['N/A'],"['Canadian Health Policy', 'Civic Participation', 'Deliberative Dialogue', 'Dissemination', 'Evidence Brief', 'Evidence-Informed Policymaking', 'Global Health', 'Integrated Knowledge Translation', 'Youth Dialogue', 'Youth Leadership']",24975.0,289593,"Health is now truly global, with serious implications for trade, security, well-being and development. Canada would benefit from considering the available research evidence on the risks and opportunities that changes in global health pose to Canadians and people everywhere. Over the past few years, the McMaster Health Forum has conducted a number of research activities on Canada's role in global health. We have undertaken extensive literature reviews, interviewed key informants, produced evidence briefs, and convened a stakeholder dialogue that included policymakers, civil society leaders, researchers and health planners. While these activities helped Canadian leaders to identify global health risks and opportunities to address them, a crucial voice was absent from these discussions. Youth leaders - who represent the future of Canadian society - are often not engaged as potential users of research evidence. Youth leaders represent thousands of other young people as the presidents of student governments, health professional student associations and research networks. These students can help ensure that research informs policy directions for Canada. We propose hosting a national youth dialogue to foster the uptake, application and dissemination of research evidence on Canada's role in global health and development among 25 of the country's top youth leaders. Students will discuss the problem, policy options and implementation considerations. The dialogue captures an important voice that Canadian officials have not yet heard and supports youth-driven outputs (e.g., a Youth Charter, letters to Ministers, op-eds, social media advocacy campaigns). It also develops a new community platform for youth to contribute to future health discussions with research evidence rooted at the core. A national youth dialogue represents an important first step toward cultivating a culture of evidence-informed decision-making and knowledge translation among Canada's future health leaders."
Suicide attempts and completions in chronic pain: a retrospective cohort study,"['Hogan, Mary-Ellen']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,364643,"We studied 18,430 pairs of Ontario adults with and without chronic pain who were identified from the Canadian Community Health Survey from 2000-01, 2007-08 and 2009-10. We linked their survey responses to Ontario healthcare administrative data, for example, hospital stays, physician visits, publicly funded drugs, death records and others.  Respondents were matched on age, sex, how far they lived from major urban areas and income.  We followed them from survey response until death or December 31, 2013 and identified suicide attempts and suicide completions in the databases.  We found more people with at least 1 suicide attempt in the chronic pain group (121 versus 61), and more suicide completions, using a broad definition that included intentional self harm, accidental poisoning and death of undetermined intent (35 versus 16).  We found no statistical difference in suicide using the definition of intentional self-harm alone."

Men who have sex with men (MSM) remain the risk group most affected by HIV in Canada and BC. We wish to examine the impact of expansion of access to ART on risk behaviour among the MSM population in Greater Vancouver and on community HIV viral load as a marker of community infectivity. We will conduct two cross-sectional surveys of MSM, spaced over a 5-year period. The surveys will be designed to be representative of the ethnic and sub-cultural diversity of MSM in Greater Vancouver. We will sample 1000 MSM aged 15 years and over at each survey, using members of different sub-populations of MSM (seeds) to recruit a diverse group of MSM. All study participants will be asked to sign a consent form, complete a questionnaire, a rapid HIV blood test, syphilis test, hepatitis C serology, and to provide consent to allow researchers access to health services databases. HIV+ participants in the surveys will be invited to enroll in a longitudinal sub-study with follow-up at 6-month intervals that will examine the effectiveness of a peer-based treatment literacy intervention for increasing ART uptake among HIV+ men currently not on treatment, and on risk behaviour for HIV transmission. The study results will assist service providers and program planners to respond to potential increases in HIV risk behaviours. The results will also directly inform policy makers in Canada and other countries with regards to the added preventive value of ART and influence decisions regarding the further expansion of ART in industrialized countries."

A Collaborative Quality Improvement Model and Electronic Community of Practice to Support Sepsis Management in Emergency Departments: Investigating Care Harmonization for Provincial Knowledge Translation.,"['Ho, Kendall', 'Jarvis-Selinger, Sandra', 'Marsden, John J']","['Goldman, Ran D', 'Innes, Grant D', 'Kamal, Noreen R', 'Novak Lauscher, Helen J', 'Patterson, Ted', 'Stenstrom, Robert J', 'Sweet, David']","['Electronic Community Of Practice', 'Emergency Medicine', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Quality Improvement Model', 'Sepsis Management / Intervention']",283424.0,172711,"Early and intensive clinical intervention of patients in emergency departments has been demonstrated by the literature to significantly improve the morbidity and mortality outcomes of patients with sepsis. Emergency medicine departments within several organizations are now advocating the adoption of early intervention guidelines for patients with the signs and symptoms of sepsis. This proposed research will lead to a comprehensive understanding of how diverse emergency department (ED) sites across British Columbia (BC) engage in a Quality Improvement Collaborative to lead to improvements in time-based process measures (e.g. time to antibiotics) and clinical outcomes (e.g. reduced morbidity and mortality rates) for septic (including severe sepsis and septic shock) patients in EDs.

Funding from the BC Ministry of Health (MoH) has led to the creation of a community (i.e. ED) driven and grassroots initiative, Evidence to Excellence (E2E), to address the challenge of translating the best evidence of sepsis management across BC emergency departments.  Improving sepsis management is one of the central foci chosen by the E2E initiative. CIHR funding for this proposed research will support the evaluation component of a sepsis management collaborative, which is currently not funded within the scope of in-kind funding provided by the MoH.

This research study will employ the IHI Collaborative model, incorporate the principles of participatory action research; and utilize an electronic CoP to engage emergency department practitioners (e.g. physicians, nurses, administrators, etc) from across B.C. to (i) share the evidence of early intervention in sepsis (e.g. exchanging ideas, engaging in discussions, sharing resources, amalgamating knowledge); (ii) adapt the evidence to their patterns of practice; (iii) develop a common set of orders for implementation of the sepsis pathway; and (iv) agree on common indicators to evaluate time-based process measures and clinical outcomes."
The Psychobiology of Regret Late in Life: A Risk Factor to Healthy Ageing,"['Holding, Anne C']",['N/A'],"['Healthy Aging', 'Psychobiology', 'Regret', 'Regret Intervention']",18750.0,493278,"In Canada, older adults represent the fastest growing demographic. This shift towards an aging population presents significant challenges for individuals and society. Specifically, health-care systems will be profoundly affected by the continued increase of the elderly population. In 2019 alone, health-care spending on Canadians aged 65 and older accounted for 45.7% of total health-care expenditures, projected rise to 71.4% in 2040. Declines in physical health remain common and have significant financial and societal implications. This underscores the need for a better understanding of the psychological risk factors that can reduce well-being and trigger mental and physical health problems in older age. 

My postdoctoral research program seeks to address this challenge by identifying late life experiences of regret as a psychological risk factor that affects mental and physical health in old age. Regret is a negative psychological state that involves blaming ourselves for a bad outcome or feeling a sense of loss or sorrow at what might have been. The research will focus on how experiences of regret can jeopardize older adults' mental health (e.g., depression), health behaviours (e.g., physical activity and sleep), physiological processes (e.g., hormonal and immune regulation), and physical health (e.g., chronic disease) over 14 years, and whether such changes are mitigated by intervening demographic (e.g., age, sex) and psychosocial factors (e.g., social support). Importantly, my research will develop and test a novel regret-reducing intervention to improve mental and physical health in late life. This research may have significant implications to the extent that decreasing the frequency and intensity of regret experiences has the potential to improve the mental and physical health of older adults and offset mounting costs facing the Canadian health care system."
Longitudinal Associations between Cyber Victimization and School Climate,"['Holfeld, Brett']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2497.0,343544,"Safe and supportive learning environments are associated with positive experiences for children at school, including reduced experiences with traditional victimization. However, the impact and development of cyber victimization within the school context is not clear. In the current study, we examine the bidirectional associations between cyber victimization and school climate in elementary school when adolescents are beginning to gain independent access to technology and cyber victimization is emerging. Participants included 714 5th and 6th grade students who were surveyed at the beginning and end of one academic year. Results indicate that student's experiences of school climate predicted cyber victimization. However, cyber victimization did not predict student's experiences of school climate. Efforts to ensure that all children's experiences at school are favourable are fundamental to preventing and reducing cyber victimization. Helping young children to understand and seek help for cyber victimization at a time when cyber technology is becoming accessible may have long-term effects on their use of these negative behaviours and subsequent negative health outcomes."
Mapping phenotypic plasticity across the life-course following childhood vaccination,"['Hollm-Delgado, Maria-Graciela']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,344305,"The development and progression of certain age-related diseases, attributed to inflammation and the gradual deterioration of the immune system over time, may be modulated by past exposure or induction of responses to micropathogens. Humoral immunity activated by standard vaccination has been linked to changes in inflammatory response pathways involved in the development of chronic disease, but it is unclear whether these effects translate into long-term changes in the risk of non-communicable diseases among older adults. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a disease profiling study using population-based data collected from persons followed prospectively for almost 50 years. Our analysis included mapping phenome-wide associations and conducting a biomarker expression analysis through a combination of multivariate and machine-learning regression techniques. The overall goal was to explore whether exposure to common vaccines was linked to long-term differences in health and disease among older adults. Our study results suggest individuals vaccinated against certain types of pathogens may have a lower risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It also showed generalized reduction in the risk of chronic disease. This work may lead to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving the development of non-communicable disease in later life and possibly identify new avenues of use for common vaccines."

This research will provide a way for persons with PD to convey aspects of their daily interactions and relationships, and the ways in which PD influences their capacity to do the activities they need and want to do to remain independent, care for their families, and contribute to their communities.
 
Forty individuals with PD will spend four weeks taking photos and journaling about aspects of their life that best illustrate the experience of living with PD. Once photo gathering is completed, participants will be asked to meet one-on-one with an investigator to convey their stories of living with PD, using the photos they have chosen to elicit discussion. They will also be asked to share their journals, and to participate in a focus group where they will share select photos and journal entries with each other. Through focus group discussion, participants will identify key aspects of the experience of living with PD important for health care professionals, family members and community members to know. 

Upon study completion, a series of community photo exhibits will be held that will showcase photos selected by participants to enhance social awareness of the impact that PD has had on their lives. This unique approach to understanding and conveying what it is like to live with PD will generate information that can sensitize health care professionals, and display the importance of attending to client-centered approaches to care that address the psychosocial implications of PD."

Thus, the identification of modifiable risk factors remains crucial for primary prevention. Air pollution refers to the contamination of the environment by any chemical, physical or biological agent that modifies the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. Past evidence has suggested that exposure to various components and sources of air pollution from occupational and residential settings may increase the risk of breast and prostate cancer. However, the specific components of air pollution are rarely investigated, and few studies have been able to consider both occupational and residential sources of exposure to air pollutants, and breast and prostate cancer risk. This research proposes to determine whether lifetime exposure to air pollution in the workplace and at home, independently and conjointly, contribute to the risk of developing breast and prostate cancer. Our research will be based on lifetime job and residential information provided by 10,666 women and men in an ongoing Quebec study. We will estimate participants' exposure to various air pollutants at work and at home, and compare the number of breast and prostate cancer cases across women and men with different exposure profiles. This study offers a valuable opportunity to examine, in a short time frame and at low cost, whether air pollution play an important role in breast and prostate cancer risk."

Being physically active have been shown to reduce the risk of some cancers. There are different types of physical activity, including activity at work and recreational activities. Participation in recreational activities has been shown to reduce the risk of lung cancer. However, the role of physical activity at work in affecting the development of lung cancer is not well established. In fact, some studies have found that people who have physically demanding jobs also have a higher risk of lung cancer. As people spend many hours at work and some jobs are very physically demanding, new studies are needed to fully understand the role of physical activity at work on lung cancer development.

In this research, we will examine how lung cancer risk is associated with physical activity levels at work. Our research will be based on an ongoing Canadian study that began in 2009. This study included men and women who have volunteered to share information on their health, lifestyle, environment and behaviour over their adult lives. Our research will include all men and women who were newly diagnosed with lung cancer since the study began. For comparison, we will select a sub-group of people, who did not have cancer at the beginning of the study. The interview asked detailed questions on the longest-held job for all participants. Using this information, we will compare activity levels in the longest-held job between those who were diagnosed with lung cancer and those who remained cancer-free. This study offers a valuable opportunity to examine, in a short time frame and at a low cost, whether physical activity work at plays an important role in lung cancer development."
Exploring sex differences in the etiology of cancers: a critical look at endocrine disrupting agents (EDCs) in the workplace,"['Ho, Vikki']",['N/A'],"['Breast Cancer', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals', 'Lung Cancer', 'Occupational Exposures', 'Prostate Cancer', 'Sex Hormones']",339100.0,422812,"Colorectal, lung, breast and prostate cancers represent more than half of all cancers diagnoses and deaths among Canadians.  Men are more likely to develop colorectal cancer and lung cancer than women. Different environmental, lifestyle and biologic factors may explain this risk difference. However, sex hormones, an obvious difference between men and women, have been shown to affect the development of various cancers. 

Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that interferes with the proper functioning of sex hormones. We are exposed to these chemicals in the environment and in diet; however, workers in certain sectors are highly exposed to endocrine disruptors.

In this research program, we will examine whether exposure to endocrine disruptors in the workplace increases the risk of cancers. Three projects are proposed to use data collected as part of ongoing studies in Canada and abroad. In Project 1, we determine whether workers exposed to endocrine disruptors are at an increased risk of developing colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer. Project 2 focuses specifically on breast cancer to examine whether workplace exposure to endocrine disruptors and genetic factors that predispose individuals to the effects of these chemicals may mutually increase risk. Finally, Project 3 undertakes a more mechanistic approach to relate workplace exposures to endocrine disruptors and sex hormone levels measured in the blood. Given that this research program is based on using existing data, this program offers a valuable opportunity to examine, in a short time frame and at low cost, whether endocrine disruptors play an important role in cancer risk."

Psychosocial effects of debilitating symptoms such as chronic pelvic pain and infertility are alarmingly common and are catalyzed and sustained by shame and stigma. Our piloting of participatory, arts-based digital storytelling (DST) with people with endometriosis suggests that DST facilitates emotional healing and connection with others, and empowers people to share their digital stories, potentially influencing social change. Digital stories can also make visible complex and marginalizing illness experiences grounded in the realities of those afflicted, of relevance, considering gendered conceptualizations and representations of endometriosis and pain. The goal of this research is to generate and begin to test a robust model of online DST as a therapeutic intervention, source of authentic experiential evidence, and knowledge translation tool for endometriosis. This will involve 1) delivering online DST workshops to people with endometriosis and qualitatively describing how workshop participation influences psychosocial health, 2) collecting psychosocial measures pre- and post-DST workshops regards participants' outcomes, 3) analyzing participants' digital stories to illuminate the gendered dimensions of endometriosis experiences., and 4) hosting hybrid Film Festival events and describing the connection between viewing digital stories and audience member attitudes. Our ultimate objective is to lay the foundation for further work that eases the profound psychosocial burden of endometriosis."

Experience Sampling)', 'Heavy Episodic Drinking', 'Self-Control', 'University Students']",172126.0,408831,"Drinking alcohol is a common part of campus culture and the university student experience. However, many students drink excessively and put themselves and others at risk. Hangovers and missed classes happen because of heavy drinking, but so do injuries, assaults, vandalism, and other offences. Most campuses offer programs that encourage students make safer decisions about alcohol use, but an overlooked problem is that students are often deliberately trying to get drunk, even when they are aware of the risks. This research will test whether there are different degrees of alcohol-related risk associated with planning to get drunk and being willing to get drunk. These intentions earlier in the day may influence whether students' self-control skills work for them (making it easier to stick to their plans to limit drinking; limiting risk of harm) or against them (making and sticking to strategic drinking choices to become drunk; increasing risk of harm). Participants will be university students who agree to respond to short surveys a few times a day on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays (peak university drinking days) during the Fall semester. Surveys in the morning will ask about the previous night's drinking, if any, as well as consequences they experienced, and will ask whether they plan to get drunk that night. Students will also complete a short mid- afternoon task and survey designed to measure their self-control. Finally, two evening surveys will ask students to report the number of drinks they've consumed, their feelings and reasons for drinking, and whether they used any strategies to limit drinking or reduce harm (like using a designated driver). Findings from this research will offer important insights to improve the effectiveness of campus-deployed prevention and harm-reduction initiatives by triangulating on combinations of drinking intentions and behaviours that pose the greatest risk of harm."

They give more information than the older pedestrian signals which just indicated walk and don't walk . These timers should allow pedestrians to make better decisions about when to cross a road.  Over 2000 new pedestrian countdown timers have been installed in Toronto from 2006 to 2010.  This research will look at whether these signals have reduced the number of car - pedestrian collisions in Toronto.  We will also look in detail at where in the city car - pedestrian collisions occur, both before and after the timers.  We will look at whether children, youth, and the elderly can use these signals effectively to improve their crossing safety.  Nine hundred thousand pedestrians are killed on the roads each year globally, so simple effective solutions to car pedestrian collisions are urgently needed."

The HIV community is responding by promoting the development of industry standards for employing workers with HIV to adequately provide support based on the unique needs of this group of workers. Often unskilled in the conventional sense of their job descriptions, peers bring accessibility to the community, rich relationship opportunities and subject relevance, and personal history to their work. Specific supports are required to address the emotional, physical, financial, and personal intensity impact this employment has on these workers. By openly discussing and including the input of peer workers to establish industry standards for support provision that can be adapted to various forms of peer employment, we will offer a valuable resource for researchers, Community organizations, Health Authorities, and others who seek to employ people living with HIV on research projects. This Caf√© Scientifique will be organized to discuss industry support standards for peer research associates living with HIV. Researchers, community organizations, Health Authorities and peer workers themselves will be invited to discuss types of supports currently available for people living with HIV working as research associates.

The success of GE-based surveillance, however, hinges on efficient genomics and contextual data (laboratory, clinical and epidemiological) sharing. While delays in data sharing have previously had devastating health consequences (e.g. Ebola and SARS outbreaks), concerns over privacy and loss of intellectual property, as well as a paucity of data sharing mechanisms create barriers for multi-jurisdictional GE practice. Furthermore, ""one-size fits all"" approaches have failed to resolve the technical, social, political, legal and ethical data sharing challenges arising in different global health settings. As such, an interdisciplinary approach combining technology development and implementation in a social science framework is needed.
Drawing on our team's expertise in creating distributed analysis platforms (www.irida.ca; www.innuendoweb.org), developing machine-readable knowledge frameworks and AI tools to harmonize GE data (www.genepio.org), and global health systems and governance, we propose to convene a 2-day interdisciplinary (information science, social science, and health science) workshop in Vancouver to discuss best practices, novel technological solutions, and stakeholder engagement strategies for enabling global GE data sharing for outbreak management. We will produce a scientific report summarizing the outcomes. While our groups have had continual funding success since 2012, this workshop will generate the roadmap needed to help us apply for large-scale funding (>$10M) to achieve the critical and ambitious goal of global GE data sharing. By transforming data sharing practices, it is not only possible to improve pathogen detection globally but also increase public health capacity resulting in better health outcomes."

It is important to identify the relationship between how these diverse groups interpret health information in order to understand how to develop health communication content that can make a behavioural impact among these high-risk groups. My proposed research examines whether the social determinants of sex, gender, and SES affect understanding of risk information by conducting secondary analysis on a large dataset about graphic warning labels on cigarette packages. Drawing from the data I have collected, I will further interview participants to better understand the specific elements of communication that generate different reactions across groups and use this information to design a health communication campaign that targets specific groups according to sex, gender, and SES. Finally, I will test this health communication approach among different groups according to sex, gender, and SES to examine the specific elements of health communication that account for the variation in behavioural intentions between these groups. Findings from this work will help determine effective ways to improve the access and quality of health information in underserved and socially marginalized populations and ultimately bridge current disparities in health."
Redefining the phenotype in complex diseases through latent classes to model intra- and inter-family heterogeneity: application to genetic linkage and association analysis.,"['Huang, Lam O']",['N/A'],"['Candidate Gene Selection', 'Gene Expression Profile', 'Genetic Heterogeneity', 'Latent Class Model', 'Multivariate Phenotypes', 'Phenotype Definition']",66000.0,183966,"Identifying the genes involved in complex diseases such as cardio-vascular disease, diabetes, asthma and psychiatric disorders is a challenge in Human genetics. The task is difficult because what we see as one disease is often a collection of several disease sub-types that, despite sharing clinical similarities, are caused by different genes and other factors. The general objective of our proposal is to develop statistical tools to distinguish the disease sub-types based on the patterns of clinical measurements, taken on patients participating in clinical studies. Once we identify in which disease subtype each patient belongs to, we can apply genetic analysis methods to find the genes causing each sub-type of disease. Specifically, we focus on studies where clinical measurements have been assessed on entire families.  Individuals within families are obviously related to each other and the statistical model we develop specifically takes into account the individuals kinships.  This novel method will increase the ability of researchers to find the genes responsible for complex diseases. Finding those genes will provide a better understanding of complex diseases that may ultimately lead to improved preventive and therapeutic interventions."
"Filial Piety, Living arrangement, and Psychological Well-Being among Older Chinese Immigrants","['Huang, Vivian']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,389233,"Filial piety (FP), a virtue of unconditional support and respect, is a core component of the parent-child relationship in Chinese culture. FP has been linked to the well-being of aging parents, including Chinese families residing in North America. Co-residence with adult children is a common practice of FP and is often associated with the perception of FP, as well as emotional and instrumental support. However, research suggests that FP practices are changing, including more Chinese aging parents prefer to live independently in order to increase autonomy and reduce intergenerational conflicts. In the context of immigrations, the economic constraints of independent living in the host country may force older Chinese immigrants to co-reside with their adult children despite their living arrangement preference. As such, it may have negative influences on the well-being of older Chinese immigrant parents. The current study examined the relationship between living arrangement (i.e., co-residence vs. independent living) and indices of FP and well-being among 302 community-dwelling older Chinese immigrants. Participants completed questionnaires that tap into expectation and perceived receipt of FP, depressive symptoms, and quality of life. Despite previous studies suggesting the negative influence of co-residence on well-being among older Chinese parents, the present results shows that older Chinese immigrants who co-reside with their adult children perceived their children as more filial pious and have better self-report psychological well-being compared to those who live independently."

Traffic calming implementation around Calgary elementary schools,"['HubkaRao, Tate']",['N/A'],"['Children', 'Community Health', 'Healthy Cities', 'Population Health', 'Traffic Calming', 'Traffic Safety']",35000.0,407518,"Across Canada, collisions with motor-vehicles are a leading cause of child bicyclist and pedestrian injuries. Each year in Alberta, over 300 children are admitted to hospital due to a severe pedestrian or bicyclist injury. Injury rates and severity can be associated with higher vehicle speeds and traffic volume, and specific traffic calming features. Active transportation can provide significant health benefits to children that last into adult-hood. However, concerns regarding injury risk can influence decisions to participate in active transportation. Given that a third of child pedestrian and bicyclist injuries occur within 300m of a school, it is important to ensure vehicles travel in a safe manner at these locations. Installing specific traffic calming features designed to reduce vehicle speed around schools can lead to a reduction in injury risk for child pedestrians and bicyclists, and increase active transportation, if traffic calming measures are appropriately aligned to the current built environment. This project will therefore seek to install specific traffic calming features around various Calgary elementary schools, and evaluate their impact on traffic behavior. 

This project will use a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial design to sequentially evaluate implementation of a specific traffic safety feature at all public Calgary elementary schools. Schools will be randomly ordered for traffic calming installation. Vehicle traffic volume and speed in front of the school will be monitored one month prior to installation, one week prior to installation, and one week following installation. School administration and parents will be contacted before and after the intervention to determine changes in perceived traffic safety. Schools will be clustered by traffic calming installation date and stratified by traffic calming feature. Traffic behavior and perceived safety will be compared between baseline, pre-intervention, and post-intervention."

It is the second-most common illness in Canada, second only to the common cold. The disease is highly infectious, requires a low infectious dose, and is well-known to cause large outbreaks in closely confined populations. While deaths are rare, hospitalization and long-term effects on the body are more likely to occur in at-risk populations, such as the elderly or immunocompromised. Action to reduce the number of norovirus cases per year is required due to its infectious nature and effect on the economy; the economic burden is high due to hospital expenditures and lost productivity. It is estimated that norovirus costs the United States 2.5 billion CAD and the United Kingdom close to 200 million CAD per year in health care costs. While laboratory surveillance is practiced in Ontario to detect norovirus outbreaks, early detection remains a challenge. This project aims to utilize syndromic surveillance using TeleHealth Ontario data in order to create an early warning system of norovirus outbreaks."

Yet, men and women in their middle years who have been hospitalized for a first heart attack are often not successful in accessing such programs and making these lifestyle changes. In this study, we propose to acquire an understanding of what influences men and women to make such changes, following hospitalization for a first heart attack, from their perspectives as well as those of their caregivers and health professionals.  We also plan to determine if making such changes is different for men and women. The results of this research will inform changes to programs and health professional practices so that men and women who have experienced a heart attack will be supported in ways that are meaningful to them in their efforts to change lifestyle habits in order to reduce the risk for a future heart attack."

Recent increased emphasis on disaster research has spurred expanded discussion regarding the ethical implications of this field of inquiry. Low-resource disaster research is associated with a range of distinctive ethical features including heightened vulnerability, insecurity and instability, need for rapid response, challenges to distinguish practice from research, amongst others. However, there remains uncertainty regarding what ethical guidance can best orient research in low-resource disaster settings.  The proposed project will address this gap and respond to the following question: What are the processes and ethical principles that can reliably guide ethics review for research in low-resource disaster settings?  The research study includes two primary lines of inquiry: 
(1)A systematic assessment of the disaster research literature with the goal of identifying characteristics of disaster research in low-resource settings and their ethical implications; and 
(2)A qualitative, interview-based study to examine the experiences of members of Research Ethics Boards that are highly experienced in reviewing disaster research protocols in order to better understand ethical issues arising in disaster research and its review, opportunities and obstacles to address these issues, and implications for ethics review of disaster research.
We will draw on this analysis, as well as examination of existing research ethics guidance, to develop a tailored normative framework. The framework will identify how relevant characteristics ought to be factored into the design of disaster research protocols and orient the process of ethics review. The final phase of the project will include knowledge transfer and exchange activities focused on two groups: disaster researchers and Research Ethics Boards that review disaster research."

We aim to improve outcomes in young people with first episode psychosis (FEP) by delivering culturally appropriate interventions, culturally adapted cognitive behavior therapy for individuals with psychosis (CaCBT), and culturally adapted family intervention for patients with psychosis and their caregivers (CulFI). We have carried out feasibility trials of both interventions in Pakistan and demonstrated acceptability and feasibility in this population. However, a larger study of a longer duration study is needed to assess clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness before steps can be taken towards implementing these interventions. We will measure patient specific outcomes including symptom severity, insight, quality of life, and functioning. We will also look at carer specific outcomes including wellbeing, carer experience, illness perception as well as depression and anxiety measures. For future scale-up and implementation, we will interview participants, family members/carers, physicians, therapists, and other stakeholders. These interviews will explore stakeholder views, facilitators, and barriers to intervention delivery. Developing evidence for psychosocial interventions in low-resource settings is key to reducing global disease burden for people with psychosis. Should the results of the proposed trial confirm the findings of our pilot studies, these interventions can be scaled up for delivery across other low-resource settings. This line of research would lead to the development of culturally appropriate interventions that could be rapidly implemented in clinical practice not only in Pakistan but other low-resource settings within Canada, to improve outcomes for affected individuals."

Previous research has showed that HIV-related stigma originating within and outside ACB communities negatively affects the wellbeing of PHA and hampers community responses to HIV.  People who experience (or expect to experience) stigma are less likely to get tested for HIV or avail themselves of treatment, care and support.  Therefore, in the presence of stigma, programs to curb the spread of HIV or improve the wellbeing of PHA are less likely to succeed. Researchers, service providers, community members and faith leaders from ACB communities are collaborating to develop, implement and test a stigma-reduction intervention for ACB faith communities.  The intervention aims to reduce inappropriate fear of contagion, negative beliefs about PHA, and the tendency to stigmatize certain population groups based on previous negative attitudes towards them.  The intervention activities - a pamphlet on HIV transmission, living with HIV, and HIV treatments; sermons and testimonials; and health fairs - will be implemented over a 6-month period in six churches in Toronto, Ottawa, Windsor and Kitchener-Waterloo. The number of ACB congregants we will reach is 1,125. The research team will conduct a survey among the participating congregations prior to launching the intervention, at the end of the intervention period, and three months after the end of the intervention, to determine whether the intervention is associated with a reduction in stigma.  The team will also interview 18 participants to examine their experience with the intervention and will monitor any events that are likely to affect the intervention.
