Myths About Cancer,"['Brazas, Michelle D']",['N/A'],"['Cancer', 'Cell Phones', 'Familial Genetics', 'Hereditary Risk', 'Myths', 'Second-Hand Smoking']",3000.0,288228,"When it comes to difficult, complex topics like cancer, myths abound. Cancer researchers frequently field questions and public inquires on cancer and many such myths surrounding cancer. 

This Cafe Scientifique series aims to directly address some of the more common cancer myths around familial genetics and the risk of inheriting cancer, second hand smoking as a cause of cancer, and cell phone usage and risk of brain cancer. By providing public opportunities for dialogue and learning around topics of importance in cancer, this proposal aims to debunk the common myths about cancer."
"Prevent, Prevent, Prevent - What is Happening in Cancer Prevention?","['Brazas, Michelle D']",['N/A'],"['Anti-Smoking', 'Cancer', 'Cancer Prevention', 'Diet', 'Exercise', 'Health And Well-Being', 'Uv Radiation Protection', 'Vaccines Against Infectious Agents']",3000.0,263488,"Cancer as a disease will affect one in four Canadians. While much research effort and discussion has occurred around improved diagnostic techniques, earlier detection and better, safer and more effective cancer therapies, little discussion takes place around cancer prevention. Yet cancer prevention remains the cornerstone to avoiding patient anxiety and costly health care strategies that follow a cancer diagnosis. Which cancers can be prevented? Are there common prevention strategies for all cancers? How do prevention strategies reduce risk? Is cancer prevention really possible?

Our Café Scientifique series will engage members of the public in conversations about cancer prevention strategies which are of central importance to all Canadians. The proposed series of Café Scientifiques entitled 'Prevent, Prevent, Prevent - What is Happening in Cancer Prevention?' will explore topics in cancer prevention. Cancer prevention topics selected for discussion include commonly known prevention strategies (i.e. UV radiation protection and healthy eating and exercise) as well as lesser-known prevention strategies (i.e. vaccine prevention of infections). With such a high incidence rate of cancer, there is a need to openly communicate on cancer issues. Through this series of open dialogues, members of the public will explore viable cancer prevention strategies with our expert panelists."
"A study to determine what categories of ideations correlate most strongly with depressive symptoms following traumatic, musculo-skeletal disability.","['Breen, Jonathon S']",['N/A'],"['Adjustment Counselling', 'Depression', 'Disability', 'Injured Workers', 'Longitudinal Study', 'Participatory Action Research', 'Social Media', 'Trauma']",105000.0,327817,"Symptoms of depression are strongly correlated with trauma-based disability. In a recent Canadian study of 201 patients with spinal cord injury, 28.9% were treated for depression within six years of injury. It is well established that depression, following an acquired disability, is a significant barrier to successful Return To Work (RTW). My study will record the disability-related thoughts and feelings, or ideations, of injured workers. I will compare them, by category, to depression levels over the period of the study. 
By exploring these relationships, I will learn what categories of disability-related life experience, as represented by these ideations, are of most significance for counsellors and other health professionals to consider and explore when developing RTW plans with injured workers. 
To accomplish this goal, I will recruit 36 participants through the Workers Compensation Boards in BC, Alberta, Yukon and the NWT. For 12 months, I will gather daily data from each participant through the use of smart phones with a dedicated app designed to allow for easy input and coding. Each participant will log in to the app on their phone and check off what disability-related ideations have occupied them over the course of that day. These will include categories described as major life issues by the World Health Organization such as employment, transportation, housing, transportation and mobility, family and social relationships, and recreation. 
The frequency and intensity of these categories will be compared to depression levels that will be rated through the completion of monthly self-administered questionnaires by each participant.
This research will be the first longitudinal study to gather disability-related ideations on an ongoing, real-time basis. By eliminating the confounding factors associated with long-term memory recall found in studies based on paper questionnaires, more accurate data will be available to assist injured workers return to work."
The Health of Canadian Caregivers: Using administrative health services data to understand the determinants of the health of caregivers of children with chronic health problems.,"['Brehaut, Jamie C', 'Kohen, Dafna E']","['Arim, Rubab G', 'Brownell, Marni D', 'Garner, Rochelle E', 'Lach, Lucyna M', 'McGrail, Kimberlyn M', 'Miller, Anton R', 'Rosenbaum, Peter L']","['Administrative Data', 'Caregiver Health', 'Child Health', 'Longitudinal Analysis']",349699.0,190460,"Parents caring for children with health problems face tremendous demands on their time, energy and financial resources. Such demands can be associated with poorer health among the caregivers themselves. These health effects are not limited to caregivers of the most seriously disabled children, but instead may occur in over 25% of all caregivers. The current study will be the first to study the vast amounts of routinely-collected health care administrative data to address this important public health issue. We will use data from the British Columbia and Manitoba health care systems to address several objectives: 1) How can we categorize good and poor child health using these data? 2) How can we measure differences in the health of caregiver groups using these data? 3) How does caregiver health change over time, before and after individual life events such as birth of a child with a health problem? 4) Is the complexity of caregiving (the number of doctor's visits, number of medications the child uses, etc.) related to caregiver health? This study brings an established, multidisciplinary team together to develop a new approach to understanding caregiver health and to better inform what services and policies will best address the needs of caregivers of children with health problems."
Targeting misinformation-associated health behaviours: Using the tools of implementation science.,"['Brehaut, Jamie C', 'Presseau, Justin']","['Colquhoun, Heather', 'Graham, Ian D', 'McCleary, Nicola', 'Nicholls, Stuart G', 'Patey, Andrea M', 'Taljaard, Monica', 'Weijer, Charles E']","['Ethics', 'Implementation Science', 'Misinformation', 'Mixed Methods', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Interventions', 'Scoping Review']",983024.0,501111,"Misinformation worsens public health in many ways, from reducing vaccination rates to preventing people from seeking life-saving cancer treatments, and has be argued to attack the very fabric of a democratic society. Efforts to combat health misinformation have mostly focused on providing people with better information or helping them to identify misinformation. Such approaches focus primarily on the information itself. Implementation science can bring new approaches to this effort, such as evidence about how to change behaviours, using specific rather than general change strategies, and engaging patients in the design of change strategies. Our proposed work will bring these new ideas to bear on the problem of misinformation in public health and health care, use new methods to assemble relevant expert knowledge and understand ethics challenges of combating misinformation, and design new misinformation-combating tools based on implementation science, behavioural theory, and real-world experience. This work will enable partner organisations specifically, and public health organisations more broadly, to be more systematic and effective in their efforts to reduce the effects of misinformation and improve public health."
"Understanding cannabis use by Canadian Veterans and its impact on their health, well-being and quality of life","['Bremault-Phillips, Suzette C', 'Heber, Alexandra', 'Snaterse, Mark', 'Cao, Bo', 'Greenshaw, Andrew J', 'Sevigny, Phillip', 'Zhang, Yanbo']","['Bélanger, Stéphanie A', 'Hines, Anthony G', 'Jetly, Rakesh', 'Agyapong, Vincent O', 'Burback, Lisa', 'Carleton, R.

For those receiving funding for medical cannabis use, data on benefits and harms to themselves and their families is lacking. Collaborating with Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC), based on de-identified administrative data, we will examine amounts and types of medical and recreational use products by Veterans in relation to conditions for which they were pensioned, providing for the first time, basic information about intensity of use and potential clinical impact  among Veterans. Determining proportions of heavy, moderate and mild level users, the blend of medicinal vs recreational cannabis products used, and any clear correlation with class of provision of VAC benefits (e.g., disability allowance or pension type), we will provide a basic framework for examining Veterans' cannabis use. We will recruit Canadian Veterans into a mixed methods study through internet study-site accessed self-report measures for assessment of mental health profiles (past and current physical and mental health diagnoses, clinical treatment participation, amounts and types of products consumed and whether cannabis was from medical or recreational use sources). We will explore perceived benefits and adverse effects of type, source and amount/dose of cannabis in relation to perceived benefit/harm to Veterans and others in relationship with them. Internet-based study site data will be examined and compared with data from encrypted Zoom interviews/focus groups with Veterans, clinicians, policy- and decision-makers. With our KT partners, we plan to inform Veterans of findings by accessible language and appropriate media; providing policy makers, social and health support stakeholders with details arising from this work. The results will be essential for supporting Veterans' needs in the context of risks/ benefits of cannabis use moving forward in a legal use context in Canada."
Differences in motor milestone attainment in 4- and 5-year old children at risk for Developmental Coordination Disorder,"['Bremer, Emily']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,324425,"Attaining motor milestones such as sitting, standing, and walking are important aspects of a child's overall motor development. Children who achieve these milestones at an earlier age may be provided with more movement opportunities and practice, which could result in improved movement proficiency in childhood. Children with developmental coordination disorder (DCD) experience significant movement difficulties; however, it is not well understood when, developmentally, children with DCD begin to fall behind their peers with typical development. The purpose of this study was to examine the average age that motor milestones were attained in children at risk for DCD (DCDr) and children with typical development. The relationship between average age of motor milestone attainment and current level of motor coordination was also examined. The motor coordination of 4-5 year old children was assessed with a standardized motor assessment; children were classified as DCDr or typical development based on their assessment score. The children's parents provided information regarding the age that their child achieved critical motor milestones. Statistical tests were used to examine group differences between the average age the motor milestones were achieved, as well as the relationship between age of motor milestone attainment and motor coordination scores. The results suggest that children with DCDr achieve motor milestones such as sitting, crawling, and walking at a later age than children with typical development; however, they often still achieve these milestones within typical time frames. We also found that children who achieve their motor milestones earlier may be more likely to have better motor coordination in early childhood. These results can help to support early identification and intervention strategies for children who may be at risk of movement difficulties, such as DCD."
Finding the right tests: Measurement of fitness in children with autism spectrum disorder,"['Bremer, Emily']",['N/A'],"['Autism Spectrum Disorder', 'Children', 'Feasibility', 'Measurement', 'Physical Fitness', 'Reliability', 'Validity']",105000.0,347937,"Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) have impaired communication, social, and behavioural skills. Research shows that they are also less physically fit than other children. Yet, the fitness measures used in these studies have not been proven to be suitable for children with ASD. Therefore, the possibility of measurement error complicates both the interpretation of these results and the planning of future research. The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility, reliability, and validity of seven tests of fitness in 8-10 year old children with ASD to identify the assessment(s) best suited to this population. Children with ASD 8-10 years of age (n=58) will be invited to participate and each child will visit the lab four times over an 8-week period. Visit 1 will provide the child with an opportunity to become familiar with the lab. Visit 2 will assess a range of factors (e.g. movement skills, body composition, behaviour) that are known to be related to fitness in children with ASD. Visits 3-4 will assess aspects of physical fitness including muscular strength, muscular power, flexibility, aerobic functioning, and anaerobic functioning. A random subset of participants (n=25) will be asked to return to the lab for an additional two visits to determine test-retest reliability of the fitness assessments. The feasibility of conducting each fitness test will be assessed with a brief questionnaire completed by the participant and assessor, respectively. Statistical analyses will allow us to draw conclusions on which tests are the most feasible to implement, whether there is good test-retest reliability, and whether the tests have good construct validity. This study will fill a critical gap in pediatric exercise science literature. These results will inform future studies of the physical fitness of children with ASD, which will help to establish the need for, and facilitate the design of, physical health interventions for this population."
The Relationship Between Fundamental Motor Skills and Physical Activity in 6-10 year old Children with and without Down syndrome,"['Bremer, Emily']",['N/A'],"['Children', 'Disability', 'Down Syndrome', 'Fundamental Motor Skills', 'Intellectual Disability', 'Motor Development', 'Obesity', 'Participation', 'Physical Activity']",4950.0,251607,"The physical activity (and inactivity) of children is a topic currently at the forefront of international health priorities due to its role in preventing obesity and its associated secondary health conditions. The incidence of obesity and inactivity is even higher in children with disabilities, which includes children with Down syndrome (DS). Recent research indicates that motor skill proficiency is positively related to physical activity. The fundamental motor skills of children with DS have been described as slow, clumsy and generally below the level of their peers with typical development (TD). Children with DS may have difficulty keeping up with their peers, they may fall more often and be unsure about running, climbing or jumping; consequently, they may avoid these types of activities. Poor motor skills can impact various aspects of the lives of children with DS including school, sport participation, vocational work, community and physical activity participation. There is very little empirical research on the activity levels of elementary school age children with DS, what activities they prefer, what factors influence their physical activity, or the best ways to facilitate lifelong healthy levels of physical activity. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship of fundamental motor skills and physical activity in 6-10 year old children with and without DS. Results of this study will help inform interventions such as Active Start and FUNdamentals programs, and provide a more clear understanding if fundamental motor skills are more or less important for physical activity in children with DS."
Investigating a motor skill intervention for preschool age children with autism spectrum disorder,"['Bremer, Emily']",['N/A'],"['Autism Spectrum Disorder', 'Children', 'Developmental Disability', 'Early Intervention', 'Fundamental Movement Skills', 'Intellectual Disability', 'Motor Development', 'Physical Activity']",17500.0,278455,"The physical inactivity of children is a public health crisis that has been linked to a number of chronic diseases including obesity. Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a common development disability that is characterized by delays in communication, social reciprocity, and repetitive behaviours; it is often associated with intellectual disability. Children with ASD have significant delays in their fine and gross motor skills which may inhibit them from engaging in active play; thus, increasing their risk of inactivity. Although little is known about the variables that contribute to physical activity (PA) in children, particularly in children with disabilities, potential factors include sport involvement, lack of transportation and finances. Many of these factors known to influence PA are not modifiable. Proficiency in fundamental movement skills (FMS) is arguably one of the most important predictors of PA in children because it is modifiable - FMS can be improved through intervention, finances are not likely to change. FMS are the basic movement skills that are essential to the future acquisition of the more complex skills required in games and recreational physical activities. Research has clearly demonstrated that FMS competency is positively related to PA yet, children with ASD experience significant delays in their FMS; thus, early intervention is of utmost importance. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of a FMS intervention on PA levels and social behaviour in preschool-aged children with ASD. Participants will engage in a 12-hour intervention over the course of 6 or 12 weeks depending on group assignment. Participants' FMS, PA, and social behaviour will be measured multiple times throughout the study: pre- and post-intervention and at a follow-up point. The findings of this study will fill an important gap in the literature and contribute to future wide-scale interventions targeting FMS competency and physical inactivity in children with ASD."

The focus of this research is on establishing the most reliable and valid measures of physical fitness in 8-10 year old children with ASD; assessing the fitness of children with ASD in comparison to a matched control group of typically developing peers; and facilitating the design and implementation of clinical- and community-based physical health interventions for children with ASD. Study 1 will assess the feasibility, reliability, and construct validity of seven different test of physical fitness to determine which test(s) are best suited for 8-10 year old children with ASD. Study 2 will compare the fitness levels of 8-10 year old children with ASD with a matched control group of typically developing children to determine any differences. Results from the first two studies will facilitate the design and implementation of a physical health intervention for 8-10 year children with ASD and assess the effect of the intervention on numerous health and behavioural outcomes (Study 3). This novel program of research will have a positive impact on the health and well-being of children with ASD and will make a significant contribution to the literature. Funding this program of research will also highlight the importance of this work and will place Canadian research at the forefront of pediatric exercise science research for children with ASD."
Investigating the effect of physical activity on executive functions and health in adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders,"['Bremer, Emily']",['N/A'],"['Adolescents', 'Cognition', 'Disability', 'Exercise', 'Intervention', 'Mental Health', 'Neurodevelopmental Disorder', 'Participation', 'Physical Activity']",135000.0,396999,"Executive functions (EF) are brain-based processes that are necessary for controlling goal-directed behaviours, and are related to several physical and mental health outcomes. Adolescents with neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) experience significant deficits in their EF, along with low levels of physical activity, poor health, and an increased risk of mental health concerns. My postdoctoral research will seek to improve EF, and by extension mental and physical health, in adolescents with NDD through increased participation in physical activity. This work will include a series of studies to test both the immediate and long-term effects of physical activity on EF and health in this population. Results from initial lab-based studies will inform modifications to existing clinical and community physical activity programs, and the effectiveness of these modified programs will also be evaluated. Specifically, I will examine the immediate effect of different types of physical activity on changes in EF in adolescents with NDD. These results will inform a study exploring the long-term effect of physical activity on EF and health outcomes. Finally, in collaboration with existing clinical and community partners, modifications will be made to inclusive physical activity programs in order to target improvements in EF and health outcomes for adolescents with NDD, and the effect of these modifications will be tested in comparison to unmodified programs. These will be among the first studies to systematically test the effect of physical activity on EF and health outcomes in adolescents with NDD through a series of efficacy and effectiveness trials. It is anticipated that the results will contribute to the development of evidence-based physical activity programming for this at-risk population, which will have numerous implications across the sectors of health, education, and recreation."
The acute effect of exercise on executive functions in children with autism spectrum disorder,"['Bremer, Emily']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,391719,"Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) experience challenges with executive functions, cognitive processes that help to plan and control behaviour. Short bouts of physical activity can improve executive functions in children with typical development, but this has not been explored in children with ASD. The purpose of this study was to examine the immediate effect of two different exercise types on the sustained attention, a type of executive function, of children with ASD. Participants between 7-12 years of age completed three 20-minute experimental conditions, in a random order, on separate days: a circuit-based workout, treadmill walking, and sedentary movie watching. Immediately pre- and post- each condition participants completed a task to assess their attention, in addition to measures of motivation, task self-efficacy, and affect. Preliminary findings suggest greater improvements in attention following the circuit-based exercise in comparison to the other conditions. Participants also reported higher levels of motivation and greater self-efficacy toward completing the attention task following both exercise conditions in comparison to the sedentary condition. Lastly, participants reported the highest level of affect, or positive feeling state, during both exercise conditions (circuit and treadmill) in comparison to the sedentary condition. These findings suggest that a circuit-based workout is not only feasible for children with ASD but also leads to positive changes in executive functioning and feeling states."
Adult Health Outcomes in Male and Female Victims of School Bullying: A Longitudinal and Genetically Informed Study of Underlying Bio-Physiological Mechanisms,"['Brendgen, Rosemarie M', 'Boivin, Michel', 'Ouellet-Morin, Isabelle']","['Booij, Linda', 'Dionne, Ginette', 'Lacourse, Eric', 'Meaney, Michael J', 'Vitaro, Frank']","['Adult Health Outcomes Of School Bullying', 'Bio-Physiological Pathways', 'Differences Between Female And Male Victims Of Bullying', 'Protective Factors']",658329.0,321394,"Bullying in schools is a severe problem in many countries. In Canada between 20% and 25% of girls and boys are bullied by peers at some point during their school years. Little is known, however, about how chronic peer victimization during the school years may affect later mental health in young adulthood. Understanding this association is crucial, because mental health problems during young adulthood have profound implications for the quality of later life. It is also critical to identify the bio-physiological mechanisms through which peer victimization gets ""under the skull, skin and cells"" and leads to mental health problems in young adult women and men. Adverse experiences such as peer victimization are thought to trigger long-lasting disruptions in bio-physiological systems, which increase the risk of negative health outcomes later in life. From a prevention perspective, it is equally important to identify protective factors that may prevent bio-physiological system disruptions and the development of long-term mental health problems during adulthood in bullying victims. It is also essential to investigate differences between female and male victims in this regard, with in turn may explain health disparities between young adult men and women. To address these issues, we will use a genetically informed design based on 420 twin pairs (840 individuals) who were recruited at birth and followed until the end of high school. By accounting for the role of genetic influences, this design is ideal for understanding the influence of adverse environmental experiences on health. Together with the previously collected data, the proposed research will provide unique insights into the long-term effect of peer victimization and offer empirically-based resources for health professionals concerned with promoting a healthy transition to adulthood for female and male victims of school bullying."
Peer abuse and adolescent health: A biopsychosocial perspective,"['Brendgen, Rosemarie M', 'Boivin, Michel']","['Lupien, Sonia J', 'Vitaro, Frank']","['Abuse By Peers', 'Behavioral Genetics', 'Longitudinal Study', 'Mental Health', 'Physical Health', 'Twin Study']",523016.0,179439,"Peer abuse among children and adolescents is a severe problem in many countries around the world. Canadian data show that 30% of boys and 24% of girls are being beaten up, threatened, taunted, or humiliated by their peers. Although physical peer abuse tends to decline over the course of primary school, nonphysical forms of abuse such as rumor spreading or social exclusion actually increase with age, with a sizable peak between ages 11 and 15 when children experience puberty and enter high school. Previous research shows that peer abuse in the early primary school years is an important environmental stressor that significantly impairs the mental and physical health of the victims. However, the neurophysiological pathway underlying the association between peer abuse and physical and mental health problems is still not well understood. Moreover, little is known about the effect of long-term exposure to peer abuse on youngsters' physical and mental health as they reach adolescence. Finally, from a disease prevention perspective, it is crucial to identify protective factors that can mitigate the negative health consequences of peer abuse. To address these issues, the proposed research aims to: 1) assess the effect of peer abuse on mental and physical health problems after the transition from primary school to high school 2) investigate the neurophysiological pathway through which peer abuse impacts on adolescent physical and mental health, specifically the mediating role of HPA axis activity (cortisol) in the stress-disease linkage, 3) examine the potential exacerbating effect of genetic vulnerability and of prior peer abuse experiences during elementary school on the link between peer abuse, HPA axis activity, and health problems, 4) test the potential mitigating effect of social support resources on the link between peer abuse, HPA axis activity, and health problems, and 5) explore potential gender differences in regard to the previously described linkages."
Adult Mental and Social Health Outcomes of Peer Victimization:  The Role of Neural and Physiological Responses to Social Challenges and Stress,"['Brendgen, Rosemarie M', 'Boivin, Michel', 'Weinberg, Anna']","['Dionne, Ginette', 'Gouin, Jean-Philippe', 'Ouellet-Morin, Isabelle', 'Vitaro, Frank']","['Adult Health Outcomes', 'Longitudinal Cohort', 'Neural And Physiological Stress Responses', 'Peer Victimization']",699973.0,408687,"In Canada, up to a third of girls and boys are bullied by their peers. Depression symptoms are the most frequently reported consequence for bullying victims. For some, these negative consequences persist into young adulthood and beyond. Chronic peer victimization in school also increases the risk of revictimization in other contexts (e.g., in college, at work or in dating relationships) later in life. Adverse experiences such as peer victimization are thought to trigger lasting changes in how our brain works and the way our body responds to stress. However, the extent to which these neural and physiological responses are involved in explaining the long-term effects of peer victimization on mental and social health problems in emerging adulthood is still poorly understood. Equally important is the identification of factors that can protect against disrupted neural and physiological responses and long-term health problems in adulthood. To address these issues, we will use a genetically informed design involving 425 twin pairs who were regularly followed since birth until age 20. We propose to build on this rich data set with a new data collection in young adulthood (age 25) to examine participants' brain reactivity as well as their cardiac and hormonal responses during exposure to socially challenging and stressful lab tasks. Current depression symptoms as well as current victimization experiences and social support will also be assessed. An overarching aim will be to investigate possible sex- and gender-related differences in these associations. This research project will contribute to our understanding of how the well-known differences in depression and victimization rates between adult women and men develop. It will also offer important information about protective factors that can be used by health professionals to promote a healthy transition to adulthood for female and male victims of school bullying."

The HIV prevalence of MSM who participated in Canadian national M-Track surveillance was 15.1% (11.1%-23.1%). Senior, junior and community-based researchers in BC, Alberta, Ontario and Nova Scotia have come together to articulate a focused research agenda designed to reinvigorate HIV prevention for MSM. We hypothesize that MSM's sexual, physical and mental health experiences, their risk perceptions and behaviours as well as their access to and use of health services are influenced by social, legal, media, and sexual environments, which have all changed dramatically over the past three decades. Our objectives are to: (1) examine how the four environmental domains (sociocultural and legal landscape, media, perceptions of risk in changing virtual and real-world communities, access to appropriate health care and social services) impact the experiences of sexual, physical and mental health and health care access for a diverse sample of MSM across Canada and influence their risk and resiliency for HIV and other STIs; (2) identify policy and program changes that would reinvigorate HIV prevention for MSM; and (3) enhance capacity to conduct research on the changing social environments and determinants of health for MSM and to develop appropriate programs and services. To achieve these objectives, we will use a two-phase mixed method design to collect information. Phase 1 will involve an online, cross-sectional questionnaire (n=1000) recruiting MSM from four provinces. In Phase 2, we include 400 in-depth interviews recruited from the online survey to explore research questions qualitatively."

Since 1998, the percentage of total reported AIDS cases in Canada among those 50 and over has increased from approximately 12% to nearly 20% in 2006 (PHAC, 2007) - a phenomenon known as the ""graying"" of HIV/AIDS. 
According to current research, older adults living with HIV/AIDS are affected physically, psychologically and socially in ways that may be exacerbated by age. For example, data from both the U.S. and Canada have consistently shown that older adults living with HIV/AIDS are significantly more likely to receive a late diagnosis than their younger counterparts diagnosis (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2008b; Kohli et al., 2006), possibly as a result of the impact of aging on the immune system and lack of clinical suspicion for HIV among health care providers (CDC, 2009; Hall, 2009). Psychologically, older adults with HIV disease have higher rates of depression and social isolation than younger adults (Karpiak, 2006). HIV stigma has been shown to be an important issue facing older adults living with HIV (Emlet, 2007) that can be a barrier to care (Desquilbet, 2009).  
Despite this demographic trend and its impacts, the issue of aging with HIV has received little media and research attention and has been ""insufficiently taken into account by policies and the Canadian health system"" (Wallach, 2008, p. 1). The 2010 View from the Front Lines (the annual report on the activities of Ontario community-based AIDS service organizations) highlighted both the growing number of older clients and the need for more information to meet their needs."

The goal of this intervention is to modify gay and bisexual men's HIV sexual risk behaviours and provide them with access to accurate sexual health information. The private, community, and academic research partnership team proposes to do this by developing a Hornet-specific online sexual health outreach educational training program with the help of our community partner, the AIDS Committee of Toronto. We will recruit and train gay and bisexual men who are Hornet users to become Hornet peer-led educational ambassadors. The research team will then evaluate Hornet ambassadors' satisfaction with the training, and also evaluate the knowledge and skills they gained after going through the online outreach educational training program. After ambassadors complete the training, they become active online outreach workers, where they will interact with to gay and bisexual men (service users) on the Hornet app to provide them with information and referrals regarding sexual health. Service users who interacted with Hornet ambassadors and who agree to be contacted at a later date will be invited to take a short online survey that will assess the impact of our intervention on their behaviour, such as getting an HIV test or getting medications to prevent HIV. They will also be asked to reflect on their overall satisfaction with the program and if they have or would contact an ambassador again. We will also examine ambassadors' perspectives on their training program and the online outreach work. This innovative project has the potential to provide evidence to inform new online HIV interventions and sexual health outreach programs targeted at gay and bisexual men who are at risk of HIV."

However, GB2M's use of online social-sexual networking sites is associated with increased risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Fortunately, the vast majority of GB2M hold favourable attitudes towards online health promotion and online outreach services. The purpose of the proposed research is to establish Canada's first prospective observational mixed-method cohort focused on sex- and health-seeking practices of GB2M who use online sociosexual sites and apps. Focused on groups of GB2M who are traditionally under-represented in research, this study will explore 2 research questions: 1) What key factors affect sexual risk in relation to prevention services and health care access and use?  2) Why and when do GB2M seek online outreach, how do they experience it, and what effect does it have? Our community-academic partnership has collaboratively articulated two hypotheses: 1) GB2M who experience online outreach will be less likely to subsequently report sexual practices with significant risk of HIV transmission, and 2) that GB2M who experience online outreach will be more likely to have HIV/STI testing following an event with significant risk of HIV/STI transmission. A total of 525 participants will be asked to complete a baseline questionnaire and online weekly diaries for three months. A sub-set of 100 participants, purposively recruited to ensure diversity, will also complete semi-structured interviews focused on perceptions of, barriers to, and desires for online outreach and HIV/STI testing and care. The quantitative and qualitative data will be analyzed with consideration to different behavioural and demographic profiles of GB2M. Improved guidelines for online health promotion, outreach, and care will be produced and distributed widely to those interested."
Impact of pregnancy and lactation duration on the female menopausal transition,"['Brennand, Erin A']","['Brown, Hilary', 'Metcalfe, Amy L', 'Scime, Natalie V', 'Shea, Alison Kathleen A']","['Breastfeeding', 'Epidemiology', 'Female', 'Lactation', 'Menopause', 'Pregnancy', 'Reproductive Health', ""Women'S Health""]",100000.0,473471,"The menopausal transition signals the end of reproduction function for females and is an important marker of health and aging. Menopause can occur any time during the midlife period of 40-60 years, however early menopause before 45 is viewed as clinically distinct and important due to significant increases in risk of chronic diseases and premature death.

Reproductive factors earlier in life such as pregnancy and breastfeeding may affect the timing of menopause, as well as whether one experiences a ""natural"" menopause with a gradual shift in hormones vs. an ""abrupt"" surgical menopause due to removal of their reproductive organs. However, the extent to which pregnancy and breastfeeding impact the timing and type of menopause is presently unclear.

It is also known that menopause is associated with the development of chronic disease, and that those experiencing problematic menopause symptoms are more likely to perceive their health poorly. Perception of one's health is important, as it is strongly linked to the use of health services, morbidity and mortality. Exploration of how pregnancy and breastfeeding impact one's perception of health during the menopausal transition has not yet been undertaken.

Using data from approximately 19,000 midlife females in the Alberta's Tomorrow Project, the proposed research will investigate how pregnancy and breastfeeding are associated with the timing and type of menopause, as well as perception of health during the midlife menopausal transition.

Findings from this research will generate novel insights into the dynamic impact that reproductive health during childbearing years can have on the menopausal transition and midlife health as females age. It will also generate important information on menopausal timing and why it varies among people, and the results hold promise for early identification of females at risk of early menopause in order to offer screening and supportive intervention to improve menopausal health."
Phylogenetic-based prevention interventions to curb the Montreal Men- Having-Sex with Men (MSM) epidemic,"['Brenner, Bluma G']","['Moodie, Erica E', 'Roger, Michel', 'Wainberg, Mark A']","['Hiv Transmission', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Phylogenetics', 'Primary Hiv Infection']",,297554,"The HIV-1/AIDS has evolved into an increasingly complex global pandemic spreading unevenly among men having sex with men (MSM), intravenous drug users, and heterosexual groups, each influenced by a complex array of biological, behavioral and cultural factors. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the key to the control of epidemics. Recent successes of Treatment-as-Prevention (TasP) initiatives have led to a utopian vision for HIV eradication, advocating universal HIV testing, treatment after diagnosis and pre-exposure prophylaxis for high-risk groups. Innumerable operational, behavioral, ethical, and fiscal issues question the feasibility and acceptability of TasP for population rather than individual benefit. 
      Evolving trends in MSM epidemics raise sobering concerns that early stage infection, often undiagnosed, will impact on the size and duration of transmission outbreaks. Our highly cited studies have used population-based phylogenetic surveillance to show that primary (0-6 months) and recent (6-18 months) stages of infection are fueling the Montreal MSM epidemic, contradicting classical epidemiological models that predict major roles of acute (0-40 days) and chronic (2-40 years). Large viral networks are the fastest-growing MSM sub-epidemic growing from 25% (9 PHI/cluster) of infections in 2007 to an alarming 54% (16 PHI/cluster) of infections in 2012. There is a public health urgency to address the MSM epidemic and optimize control programs (targeted testing, early treatment, and risk-reduction interventions) to interrupt PHI-related transmission cascades.Past funding led to the SPOT rapid testing site providing detailed demographic, testing habits, partnerships and risk behavior information needed to define risk correlates of PHI clustering and evolutionary trends where 9% of viruses are super-spreaders contributing to 54% of new infections."

Our findings show half of the male-sex-male (MSM) epidemic in Quebec is driven by newly infected persons, often unaware of their status. Transmission networks arise wherein one infection is associated with 10 onward transmissions. Our study will combine phylogenetic,epidemiologic and cohort approaches to ascertain the driving forces of the provincial MSM and heterosexual epidemics with a view to improving testing, treating, and prevention paradigms so as to avert and ideally eradicate onward spread of HIV."
Predicting the Risk of Advanced Colorectal Polyps with Circulating Biomarkers (P-RAP),"['Brenner, Darren M']","['Heitman, Steven J', 'Hilsden, Robert J', 'Lix, Lisa M', 'McIntyre, John', 'Muti, Paola', 'Rabeneck, Linda', 'Tinmouth, Jill M']","['Advanced Adenoma', 'Biomarkers', 'Colorectal Cancer Screening', 'Population-Based', 'Risk Prediction']",451351.0,401181,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most commonly diagnosed cancer and second leading cause of cancer death in Canada. When detected early, survival rates for CRC are dramatically increased and symptoms are substantially reduced. Colonoscopy is the standard for CRC screening in ""high risk"" adults (with a personal or family history of CRC and/or certain inherited syndromes). However, a tool or that can accurately predict the risk of CRC development among those who are considered ""average risk"" can be used to target certain individuals for earlier or more intensive screening. Only a handful of tools for risk prediction of colorectal polyps (common precursors of CRC) currently exist and solely include demographic, clinical and lifestyle factors. In this project, we will develop a colorectal polyp risk prediction model that improves upon existing tools by incorporating biomarkers from circulating blood. We will use two existing databases of consenting participants undergoing colonoscopy from two colorectal cancer screening centres in Calgary, AB and Toronto, ON, who provided blood samples and completed questionnaires on their lifestyle, diet and physical activity. We will select 400 individuals who had advanced polyps (cases) and 400 individuals who were polyp-free (controls) at the time of colonoscopy.  We will examine relationships between biomarkers and advanced polyps and will expand a risk prediction model for advanced polyps using information blood biomarkers in addition to questionnaire data.  Polyps are one of the earliest stages in CRC progression and their identification and removal can prevent CRC development. Risk prediction models that combine demographic, clinical and lifestyle factors, in addition to biological blood markers, may provide a unique opportunity to increase the effectiveness of CRC screening among ""average risk"" adults."

However, who and how we screen for cancer has evolved over time. There are new tests, new needs, and new emerging disease trends. One example of these changes is the increase in early-onset colorectal cancer (eoCRC), among Canadians diagnosed before age 50 - the current recommended age to start screening.  In the US, they have already revised their guidelines to screen at age 45 and in some cases as young as 40.  In Canada, our healthcare system and how we run screening programs is very different than the US. Making a change to guidelines can have a major impact on scarce health resources, therefore many additional pieces of research and evidence are required for provinces and territories to make proper, informed decisions on whether they should change their screening programs. This grant would provide the evidence for these decisions using our Rapid Evaluation FRAmework for the Modification of Cancer ScrEening (REFRAME) Guidelines. 

In this project, we will develop the tools to generate the information needed for the provinces to make these types of decisions. We will develop several automated processes to rapidly synthesize what we know about the new questions in cancer screening, how much it would cost to make any changes, and what would be needed across provinces to enable these changes. For this project, we will use eoCRC as the lead example, but we will generate a sustainable, reproducible, and reusable tools that could be used to evaluate other screening changes such as for cervical, lung, breast, as new tests emerge and cancer trends change with our evolving population. Thus, the successful completion of this project has clear next steps and broad ongoing impact in cancer control. Upon the completion of this project, provinces would be equipped with the information they need to make important decisions for patients. REFRAME offers a short time-to-impact in cancer control."

Until recently, the focus of TB programs worldwide has simply been on treating TB cases who present to clinics, however this strategy of awaiting cases has done little to accelerate the goals of one day eliminating TB.  TB cases who are coughing and do not start treatment can continue to spread the disease, and quickly finding and engaging those with TB disease in the community is considered a top public health priority.
Peru has one of the most well-established TB programs, yet continues to see new cases of TB every year and has one of the highest TB rates in the Americas.  The local Direccion de Salud in San Juan de Lurigancho, the district with the highest TB incidence in Lima, Peru, have decided to proactively introduce a program for evaluating families of TB cases in order to more rapidly engage families and detect secondary cases within households. This Home Visitation Program proposes to visit homes in order to better engage with families, describe and explain TB risk factors and evaluate household members for TB disease.  We are proposing to take advantage of the roll out of this Home Visitation Program in order to have the extremely rare opportunity to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of introducing such a program.  Detecting family members with TB sooner, could mean they are enrolled sooner in their TB disease, could improve their positive health outcomes by curing their TB disease and could mean interrupting the continued spread.
Demonstrating that active case-finding among adult household contacts is cost-effective in a low-resource, TB endemic setting has the potential to revolutionize how these programs approach TB control, and hopefully, to finally realize the goal of a world where TB is no longer one of the captains of the men of death."

Discussions thus far have been informed by a preliminary pilot study that surveyed individuals with aphasia and their caregivers on the accessibility of information and communication in public spaces. Results of our pilot survey suggest that most public spaces are not equipped to provide alternative means of communication and information for this population. Thus, many of the participants claimed that they avoid going to such places due to the obstacles and anxiety they face. While the team's ultimate goal is to provide optimal, alternative means for individuals with aphasia to navigate and enjoy the museum, before a satisfactory solution can be created first we must assess their actual experience and needs when visiting this space. A guided walk-through with the individuals and caregivers will assess their needs in terms of the environment and the obstacles they face when they navigate the museum and attempt to understand its exhibits. This in-situ assessment constitutes the proposed innovation phase of our long-term inclusivity initiative by bringing together patients, caregivers and team members to collaboratively explore the challenges and hurdles posed by a visit to the museum in order to jointly identify and implement preferred solutions."

To do this, we will run a study where adults breathe in woodsmoke while they are supported to eat a healthier diet or not and compare how the lungs respond each time. When we support people to eat a healthier diet, we will give them advice on healthier eating and deliver meals and groceries to their homes with ingredients that meet healthy diet recommendations.

Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, which breed in clean standing water, are the main carrier of the four strains of dengue, which can lead to simple dengue fever, more serious dengue haemorrhagic fever, and the life-threatening dengue shock syndrome. An estimated three billion people are currently at risk of dengue fever, based on A. aegypti's tropical distribution. Dengue prevention has increasingly involved community-based projects aimed at eliminating the containers in which mosquitoes breed, including uncovered drinking water containers, used tires, and discarded containers like soft drink bottles and cans. There is still some controversy over the best methods to prevent dengue, and lessons learned in individual research projects are often not incorporated into national or international dengue control initiatives. I therefore propose to systematically review the international literature on dengue control, and arrive at a synthesis of policy-relevant recommendations. Then, I will explore opportunities for incorporating these recommendations into national policy in Ecuador, a country with both a dengue problem and experience with community-based dengue control. It is my goal to extend local-level collaborative processes to inform larger-scale policy by bringing researchers and policymakers together in a forum where exchange of information on dengue control can take place. In theory, this process will promote optimally effective dengue control policies, as well as societally-relevant future dengue research projects, in Ecuador and elsewhere in Latin America."
Global health research and corporate funding sources: A decisionmaking tool for individuals and organizations,"['Brisbois, Benjamin W']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,352443,"Global health research on healthcare and other factors contributing to good health is increasingly funded by corporations or the foundations they give money to. While this has funded valuable studies and made contributions to better population health, it can sometimes compromise the scientific value of the research. It may also lead to inappropriate research priorities, and can help irresponsible corporations to improve their image without making meaningful changes to their practices. Health research is highly competitive and researchers are often extremely busy. Their decisions about whether or not to accept corporate funds often rely on personal experience and judgment, but not on research about the effects of corporate funding. It is therefore possible that such decisions about corporate funding can lead to consequences that are bad for health in the long term. The proposed session at the Global Symposium on Health Systems Research will present a set of questions that can help global health researchers to make decisions about corporate research funding in a way that is more consistent, thoughtful and informed by scholarship. The questions will be justified using a review of how corporate funding has been found to affect health research, and illustrated using the experiences of a Canadian global health organization. Participants will next apply the questions to case studies, including ones drawn from their own experiences, before discussing overall lessons for global health. The session will help to promote more thoughtful approaches to research funding for global health. It may therefore lead to health research that more effectively engages with the root causes of health problems. This should in turn promote healthcare and public health policies and interventions that most effectively improve the health of populations around the world."

En 2001, ils constituaient la troisième cause de la charge totale de morbidité dans le monde (21%), juste après les maladies infectieuses et parasitaires (41%) et les maladies cardiovasculaires (26%). Les études antérieures ont montré que les groupes de statut socioéconomique faible, le plus souvent définis par  la scolarité, la catégorie professionnelle et le revenu, vivent davantage de PSM que ceux de statut élevé. Au cours des dix dernières années, plusieurs études ont montré que des stresseurs psychosociaux du travail, ainsi que d'autres caractéristiques de l'environnement de travail sont associés à la détérioration de la santé mentale. Par exemple, ces études suggèrent que le risque d'avoir des PSM chez les travailleurs exposés aux stresseurs psychosociaux serait de 11 à 98% plus élevé que celui des travailleurs qui n'y sont pas exposés. L'environnement de travail pourrait donc jouer un rôle important dans les inégalités sociales de santé mentale. Un nombre restreint d'études a examiné la contribution de l'environnement de travail au gradient socioéconomique de la santé mentale. L'étude proposée mesurera pour la première fois la contribution de l'environnement de travail au gradient socioéconomique de santé mentale en intégrant une mesure valide des deux modèles les plus reconnus pour évaluer les stresseurs psychosociaux du travail et en intégrant un large spectre de dimensions de l'environnement de travail. L'étude portera sur plus de 5000 travailleurs interrogés entre 2007 et 2008 au Québec. Cette étude contribuera à l'effort actuel de prévention des problèmes de santé mentale."

The WHO calls for the development of measures to enable adolescents' access to SRHS. Regarding public health ethics, the place of parental consent requirements in healthcare embodies a paradox: parental consent laws are intended to protect adolescents' well-being, but literature shows that parents can be a barrier to adolescents' access to SRHS. The applicant's doctoral research explored with Colombian adolescents the ethical issues concerning their access to SRHS. Contrary to research in other cultural contexts, most Colombian participants reported wanting a greater involvement of their parents on the subject but complained that their parents lacked the adequate scientific knowledge to help them make informed decisions regarding their sexual/reproductive health (e.g., choosing a contraceptive option). The present research aims to explore with parents their interest in engaging in adolescent-centered interventions to help adolescents access needed SRHS. Parents of adolescents aged 10-19 in Argentina, Brazil, and Peru will be invited to respond to surveys and interviews. Using three countries will allow for a cross-cultural analysis and orient the development of culturally appropriate health measures. The main objectives of the research is to explore with parents: 1. Their opinions on adolescents' rights to make sexual/reproductive health decisions, 2. Their interests in receiving comprehensive sex education resources on how to discuss sexual/reproductive health with their adolescents and help them access SRHS. This project is part of a larger program of research that will use a randomized clinical trial to explore the public health effects of providing comprehensive sex education to parents of adolescents (e.g., use of contraceptives, rates of HIV/STI testing)."

The burden of HPV-related diseases is higher in regions with higher poverty and lower education, and among immigrants and men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM). Recently, school-based HPV vaccination programs for girls were implemented across Canada at an annual cost of more than $100 million. However, failure to vaccinate girls most at risk of infection and disease (e.g., lower SES, immigrants) could mitigate the anticipated population level benefits of HPV vaccination and accentuate existing health inequalities. Furthermore, other groups such as boys, MSM and older females are not currently included in HPV vaccination programs, producing inequalities. Very few modeling studies have attempted to identify optimal HPV vaccination and screening strategies in terms of cost-effectiveness, and none in terms of reduction in inequalities. To fill this important gap in knowledge, our multidisciplinary team will use state-of-the-art transmission-dynamic modelling techniques combined with high-quality data to answer the following key questions: 1) What is the population-level effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of current HPV vaccination programs? 2) What is the impact of these programs on inequalities? 3) What are the most effective and cost-effective vaccination and screening strategies to reduce HPV-related burden of disease and inequalities? The proposed research will make important methodological contributions as transmission-dynamic models have yet to examine issues related to inequalities following immunization. More importantly, our analysis directly addresses the needs of policy-makers for evidence on equity, in addition to effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. Ultimately, our results will be translated into customized messages to help policymakers optimize HPV vaccination and screening programs, and reduce inequalities."

For example, chronic exposure to numerous toxins from cigarette smoke is a leading preventable cause of death in Canada and globally. The majority of these deaths are from cancers, heart disease and respiratory illnesses. However, the impact of tobacco smoke on disease risk is region-specific and dependent on genetics, diet, lifestyle and socioeconomic factors. These effects contribute to differences in health outcomes since current smokers in high-income countries, such as Canada, may have greater risk for death and chronic disease burden than individuals from middle- and low-income countries despite smoking at the same intensity level. Yet, the causes for these striking differences in tobacco-related deaths and disease burdens remain uncertain - this is the 'smoking paradox' that our research will address.

Our proposal aims to decipher the causes for differing health outcomes from tobacco smoking between countries, which is subject to error as epidemiological studies rely on self-reported smoking history from questionnaires. We will use innovative methods based on mass spectrometry for quantitative analysis of metabolites in urine reflecting tobacco smoke exposure from 8,073 participants in the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiological (PURE) study. This approach is critical for reliable assessment of tobacco exposure and nicotine dependence in active smokers not feasible by self-reports. For the first time, we will measure a broad panel of urinary biomarkers of tobacco smoke exposure and their potential harm in current and never smokers from 14 different countries while also exploring the complex interactions of local air pollution and dietary habits on disease risk. Our proposal will transform environmental epidemiology by developing evidence-based public health policies to reduce disease burden in vulnerable populations not achievable by current tobacco control measures."

Testimony and Truths: Evaluating the Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Commission,"['Bronstein, Talia']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal Health', 'Historical Analysis', 'Mental Health', 'Outcome Evaluation', 'Program Evaluation', 'Qualitative Research', 'Surveys And Interviews', 'Trauma']",17500.0,279441,"The Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC), established June 1, 2008 with a five-year mandate, allows Indian Residential School survivors the opportunity to testify about their experiences in Residential Schools as a means to heal from trauma. The Canadian TRC exposes several questions, which have yet to be explored in the context of previous TRCs internationally. There is a great need to investigate whether individuals find the TRC an effective means of personal healing from the trauma associated with Indian Residential Schools and whether participation in this program improves mental health outcomes on a population level for residential school survivors. As part of my Masters of Public Health, I propose to undertake an outcomes evaluation study that utilizes qualitative techniques. Semi-structured interviews will be conducted with IRS survivors who testified at the TRC National Events to gauge the self-reported level of healing as a result of testifying and whether the participants experienced any unanticipated adverse psychological impacts.  A control group of IRS survivors who did not participate in the TRC will be used to validate the results. I hypothesize that while testimony sharing is a valuable endeavor to improve mental health and personal healing, the process is associated with significant psychological risks that should be addressed by providing better support for those who testify. By determining the effectiveness of this national program, I hope to provide the first evidence in Canada of whether the TRC model of testimony sharing is a successful population-level public health approach to improving mental health of populations who have undergone mass trauma."

Our proposed consortium will play a pivotal role in supporting the research needed to address these issues. We will accomplish this by linking standardized environmental exposure data about air quality, green spaces, walkability, noise and other aspects of the urban/suburban environment to existing human health data platforms. This will enable studies looking at how these factors affect health, from birth to old age. We will also be able to map, over time, where and how conditions are changing, and how that increases or decreases the risk of health impacts. Our Consortium includes many leading researchers in Canada, and our specific aims by the end of the first five years are to have:
•Completed the linkage of the above exposure metrics to individuals in multiple cohorts.
•Filled priority gaps in the environmental data identified by environmental health researchers and knowledge users and delivered the existing and new data and methods to the platform.
•Worked closely with environmental epidemiologists (CANUE members and others) to generate new knowledge on the association between features of the urban/suburban environment and health outcomes, emphasizing analyses that consider multiple exposures and their interactions."

Despite this dramatic increase in older Aboriginal peoples, there is a dearth of research concerning this cohort (Wilson, Rosenberg, & Abonyi, 2011), especially in regard to their physical activity. Physical inactivity is a major risk factor for many chronic diseases that are prevalent in Aboriginal populations (Waldram, Herring, & Young, 2006). Physical activity interventions can be highly effective for improving the overall health of adults over the age of 65 (Taylor et al., 2004). It is thus especially important to have physical activity programs that are culturally safe. I will use a case study methodology for my community-based research, which will expand on the current body of literature pertaining to older Aboriginal peoples' participation in physical activity. I will examine the ""Elders in Motion"" program in Yellowknife and Fort Resolution, run by the Northwest Territories Recreation and Parks Association (NWTRPA).

Culturally Safe Physical Activity for Aboriginal Older Adults in the NWT,"['Brooks-Cleator, Lauren A']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal Peoples', 'Cultural Safety', 'Health', 'Older Adults', 'Physical Activity']",900.0,330745,"In the NWT, older adults, defined as individuals over the age of 60, are members of the fastest growing age demographic in the NWT.

Research has demonstrated that Aboriginal older adults suffer from much poorer health in comparison to non-Aboriginal older adults. Physical activity (PA) is an important way to improve health; nevertheless, limited research has been conducted to understand what PA means for Aboriginal older adults, or what culturally safe PA might look like for this population. Cultural safety allows for the recognition that existing PA programs and policies could be perpetuating colonialism. While some authors have argued that there is no quantitative evidence that shows that culturally safe PA programs are needed for this population, there is a significant body of qualitative evidence that suggests the necessity of PA that addresses the diverse needs of Aboriginal peoples. In this presentation, I will use a postcolonial theoretical lens to argue for the need for the development of culturally safe PA for Aboriginal older adults in the NWT. A postcolonial lens that is informed by cultural safety encourages community-based research to be conducted in order to recognize the historical, social, cultural, political, and economic changes and structures that shape PA programs and policies for Aboriginal older adults in the NWT. These arguments serve as the foundation for my doctoral research."

It includes optimizing the opportunities for health, lifelong learning, participation and security to enhance the quality of life as people age. Active aging is supported and enabled through the development of age-friendly cities. The city of Ottawa is considered an Age-Friendly Community; however, Indigenous seniors in Ottawa are still very marginalized. Their health and social needs need to be addressed to ensure that they have equal opportunities for active aging, but from their perspectives and based on their own experiences, beliefs, values, and cultures. Limited research has been conducted to understand what active aging means for Indigenous seniors and what they consider to be an age-friendly community, especially from a cultural safety perspective. A cultural safety lens allows for the recognition of the social, political, and historical structures resulting from colonialism that shape Indigenous seniors' experiences with old age and their quality of life and privileges their knowledge as expert knowledge. In this presentation, I will present preliminary findings from my doctoral research. These findings will show how Indigenous seniors and health and social services staff who work with them define aging well and will explore some of their enablers and barriers to aging well.

MRI parenchymal enhancement and risk of breast cancer: A population-based study of women screened in the Ontario Breast Screening Program,"['Brooks, Jennifer D']","['Chiarelli, Anna M', 'Done, Susan J', 'Jiang, Huan', 'Kulkarni, Supriya', 'Muradali, Derek', 'Yaffe, Martin J']","['Breast Cancer', 'Breast Density', 'Enhancment', 'Epidemiology', 'High-Risk', 'Mammogram', 'Mri', 'Screening']",478124.0,356284,"The Ontario Breast Screening Program (OBSP) High-Risk Screening Program includes women between the ages of 30 and 69 years who have a very high risk of breast cancer. As part of this program, women undergo breast screening every year with both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and mammogram. Because of their very high risk, these women are also frequently considered for preventive surgeries (e.g., having their breasts and/or ovaries removed). While potentially reducing a woman's risk of breast cancer, these surgeries can seriously impact their quality of life. New markers of breast cancer risk that can identify the women who would benefit the most from these interventions are needed. This will help provide personalized recommendations for both breast cancer prevention and screening.

Mammograms generate an image of the breast where fat appears white and breast tissue appears dark. The amount of breast tissue a woman has is called mammographic density (MD). Having high MD is known to strongly increase a woman's risk of breast cancer. This relationship is well known in average-risk women but it is not known if it is also true for high-risk women. Another characteristic of the breast that might tell us about a woman's risk of breast cancer is seen on MRI and is called background parenchymal enhancement (BPE). Small studies have shown that having high BPE may increase a woman's risk of getting breast cancer. Dr. Brooks and her research team will examine the relationship between MD and BPE and risk of breast cancer in women being screened in the OBSP High-Risk Program. This study will be the first to look at the relationship between BPE in an established screening program.

This study will provide us with information that will better determine a woman's risk of getting breast cancer, helping to guide recommendations for breast cancer screening and preventive interventions. This could significantly impact how high-risk women are screened and treated in the future."

Currently, new immigrant populations in Canada have lower vaccination rates than non-immigrants. Therefore, it is important to find more culturally appropriate ways to communicate the health risks posed by influenza and childhood diseases.

This study will examine how immigrant women access, understand, and react to vaccine information in their decisions about seasonal flu vaccines and childhood vaccination. It will also explore how immigrant women gather different forms of vaccine information, for example, from clinics or from the print media, television or the internet. This will help us understand if immigrant families have lower vaccination rates because they have less access to information about vaccine risks. Alternatively, the health information for immigrants may be less persuasive or not appropriate for a variety of cultural reasons. 

This project will consist of two parts. First, I will interview Immigrant Mothers to find out how they access and understand information. Second, I will analyse the content of the vaccination information accessed by immigrant women.

However, research examining how the various movement behaviours interact to influence physical and mental health is in its infancy. In our study, we investigated whether adolescents in grades 7 to 12 could be categorized into distinct groups based on levels of physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep as well as whether group membership predicted differences in self-rated physical health and depressive symptoms one year later. Results demonstrated evidence of five unique movement behaviour groups: high physical activity/low sedentary behaviour/high sleep (31%), high physical activity/high sedentary behaviour/high sleep (3%), low physical activity/low sedentary behaviour/high sleep (54%), low physical activity/high sedentary behaviour/high sleep (10%) and low physical activity/moderate sedentary behaviour/very high sleep (2%). Group membership significantly predicted physical and mental health one year later. Specifically, the high physical activity/low sedentary behaviour/high sleep group reported significantly lower depressive symptoms and greater physical health compared to each group, whereas the low physical activity/moderate sedentary behaviour/very high sleep group reported significantly higher depressive symptoms compared to each group. Overall, findings suggest that unique combinations of various movement behaviours shape developmental health trajectories in adolescence. Considering adolescents that do not follow a lifestyle consisting of being active while also engaging in low levels of sedentary behaviour and not getting too much sleep are at increased risk of future physical and mental health problems, it is important that we intervene during this critical period to reduce health risks as they transition into adulthood."

"Socioeconomic status, child developmental health and within-family relationships: Examining the differential effects of families, persons and dyads using the Social Relations Model","['Browne, Dillon T']",['N/A'],"['Children', 'Developmental Health', 'Family', 'Multilevel Modeling', 'Risk', 'Social Relations Model', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress']",150000.0,247819,"Socioeconomic status is associated with better relationships amongst family members. Moreover, family relationship quality is an important determinant of child health. However, this pattern is complicated by the fact that two people influence the content and quality of interactions. It has been difficult to isolate what certain individuals ""contribute"" to a relationship, versus what is common to the family, and what is specific to a particular partnership. Similar difficulties arise when trying to determine which aspects of family life contribute to developmental health. These limitations can be addressed by taking a unique approach to family research and observing individuals interact in multiple one-on-one contexts (e.g. mother-oldest child, mother-father, mother-youngest child, father-oldest child, and so on). The proposed study of 501 families will adopt this research paradigm and, subsequently,  determine (a) what aspects of family life are impacted by socioeconomic status and (b) what aspects of family life are driving child health outcomes. These findings will have implications for social policy and program design."
Socioeconomic gradients and multilevel influences in child health outcomes: Examining the moderating role of parent-child relationships within and between families,"['Browne, Dillon T']",['N/A'],"['Children', 'Chronic Conditions', 'Families', 'Multilevel', 'Parenting', 'Psychopathology', 'Risk', 'Siblings', 'Socioeconomic Gradients', 'Socioeconomic Status']",17500.0,201057,"The present program of study seeks to (a) understand the factors that influence the relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and child health (both chronic conditions and behavior problems) and (b) understand the relationship between SES and health as it pertains to individuals versus entire families. Much research has outlined the relationship between family socioeconomic status and child health outcomes.  This relationship, commonly referred to as a socioeconomic gradient, occurs when children and families in lower socioeconomic strata experience poorer health. To date, most research has focused on uncovering the associations for different health outcomes, and elucidating the biological pathways through which these effects operate. However, there is limited research on the factors that modify the strength and severity of socioeconomic gradients. Research on resilience has demonstrated that at-risk children may experience positive health outcomes if they are exposed to protective factors, which include a positive family environment, social support, and healthy relationships. We hypothesize that children who experience protective factors, especially in the form of positive parent-child relationships, will show less steep socioeconomic gradients, or a weakened relationship between SES and health. Moreover, little or no research has contrasted the gradient effect at the individual versus family levels. By using advanced statistics and a sibling-study design, we hypothesize that socioeconomic gradients will be primarily child specific, though we also expect that there will be family-level effects on child health outcomes. That is, we will disentangle healthy children versus healthy families and examine the effects of SES on each. Better understanding in these domains will allow the scientific community to accurately inform interventions and policy in poverty reduction, health promotion, early child care, work-family balance, and clinical practice."
"Socioeconomic status, child health and the role of within-family relationships: Identifying differential effects of families, individuals and dyads using the Social Relations Model","['Browne, Dillon T']",['N/A'],"['Development', 'Developmental Health', 'Family', 'Health Inequity', 'Multilevel Modeling', 'Relationships', 'Risk', 'Social Relations Model', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress']",105000.0,257402,"Socioeconomic status (SES) is one of the strongest predictors of child health. Scientists have suggested that this relationship exists because poorer persons do not access social resources, have less healthy lifestyles, and are exposed to stress. Recently, researchers from various disciplines have concluded that stress exposure is the most important factor. In particular, it appears that stresses within family relationships are driving the SES-health association. Households are characterized by more hostility and less warmth under low SES conditions and children in these homes are often anxious and worried, contributing to the development of poorer health. However, it is unclear if entire families, particular persons or particular relationships are affected by SES. Moreover, it is unclear which of these components are most influential on child health. The present study will address these limitations using a unique approach to
research and a sample of 501 families. Within each family, all family members will be observed interacting during a series of one-on-one videotaped sessions. The sessions will be rated, and then a complex statistical methodology will be applied to isolate the behaviour of families, persons and unique one-on-one relationships. Due to existing research on favouritism between siblings, it is predicted that particular persons and entire families will be most affected by SES and impact child health. That is, under stressful situations, interactions will be more random and chaotic, both in the way
parents behave and in the relationship patterns of entire family units. This research will help inform social policies aimed at helping families of lower SES. In particular, health care professionals and government officials will better know where to focus their energies when developing prevention programs and providing treatment. Such research is important in a global climate characterized by increasing income and health inequities."

Many First Nations families live in difficult conditions that put them at high risk for child abuse or neglect. Poor housing, poverty, and addictions are only a few of the risk factors that make it challenging for caregivers to meet their children's basic needs.
Home visiting programs, which involve visits to families with young children in their homes by nurses or other trained professionals, can help to reduce the risk of child abuse or neglect. The home visitors give support to the families in several ways; they may help with family functioning, build parenting skills, or connect families to health care or community services.
Manitoba has two home visiting programs: one is open to Manitobans who live off-reserve, and the other runs in First Nations communities. In our study, we will look at whether there is a relationship between participating in these programs and 1) child maltreatment; 2) child development at kindergarten; and/or 3) mental health and functioning of the parents. We will use the data at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy, and link it to data collected by First Nations program leaders and planners.
We have formed a diverse team of researchers and decision makers from First Nations communities and government sectors. These connections will help to make sure that the results we get from this study will be used in planning policy and programs to support the health and well-being of First Nations families."

Indigenous communities worldwide are currently in the process of reclaiming rights to their own knowledge production and preservation within and beyond the specific domain of health and health care. The National Aboriginal Health Organization and Aboriginal Health research scholars in Canada are advocating for 'decolonizing' research, which includes questioning the assumption that Western knowledge and science can effectively guide health research, policy and knowledge translation in local Indigenous Canadian contexts. Community-engaged research that fosters Indigenous approach to inquiry, health policy and planning are warranted to provide solutions to complex socially rooted mental health inequities, such a suicide and substance use. Lacking, however, are research approaches that put Indigenous knowledge, teachings and values at the centre of mental health research. This planning grant will be use for a Roundtable in each of four communities to (1) engage Kwakwaka'wakw Chiefs, Elders and youth as stakeholders in dialogue about Indigenous approaches to mental health research in their communities and (2) develop recommendations for implementing a health research and policy framework for Indigenous knowledge centred mental health and wellness for Northern Vancouver Island."

The project, called Work 2 Give, has created a federal prison-community partnership with the Tsilhqot'in First Nations in the Central Interior of BC. The prisoners, many of whom are Indigenous, engage in meaningful work within the institutions, knowing they are contributing to improved quality of life and well-being for children and their families (e.g., making beds for children). In a small ongoing study being conducted about the impact of Work 2 Give on the prisoners and the recipient communities, we have learned that the communities themselves have much to contribute to expand the impact, relevance and reach of the project to benefit both the Tsilhqot'in peoples and the prisoners involved in making the items. Several participants acknowledge the importance of the items received but the greater impact about being able to ""help our men inside"". To foster the maximal impact of Work 2 Give for Indigenous wellness and for prisoner rehabilitation, we propose Tsilhqot'in ways of knowing and values be integrated into the current model that, at the moment, is primarily driven by the Correctional Services of Canada. In this grant, we will collaborate with our established prison and community partners to learn from the communities using co-created methods and inclusive approaches to bring Tsilhqot'in knowledge and cultural perspectives on wellness into the current Work 2 Give model. The aim is to generate a more effective Work 2 Give intervention to propel future research to achieve reciprocal benefit, both for the prisoners' potential for rehabilitation through meaningful work and giving to others, and Indigenous wellness for Tsilhqot'in children, families and communities."

Building on decades of Indigenous community-driven research, a partnership with Correctional Service of Canada (CSC) since 2014, and ongoing participatory studies with currently and formerly incarcerated people and Indigenous Elders, we draw from pilot study findings initiated during COVID-19 to strengthen benefit and study impacts of art and writing kits in prisons. The pilot included distribution of kits containing visual art and creative writing materials, art and poetry prompts, Indigenous plant medicines, and messages of support/guidance from Elders. Pilot findings indicate that future tailoring of art kits content and ongoing guidance from Peers and Elders is crucial for maximum benefit, and that art-making workshops can enhance culturally safe creativity. We anticipate that the intervention can expand to support long-term social connections, mental health and wellbeing. We will study intervention impacts across eight federal prisons in BC by conducting surveys measuring different aspects of mental health; interviewing participants in prison and prison staff, observing the intervention in prison, tracking engagement in art-making, and integrating CSC mental health case reports and administrative data. We will support CSC policy action and prison health services to improve mental health outcomes. All activities will be guided by Indigenous Elders and Peer Leaders. Future funding will be sought to tailor and evaluate the intervention across Canada, as well as to expand the intervention for people leaving prison. Findings will be used to advocate for the mental health, wellbeing, and dignity of people in prison. Indigenous community Knowledge Translation Partners who support people leaving prison and team leadership from formerly incarcerated people will help us translate findings to focus on people leaving prison across BC."
Women with intellectual and developmental disabilities: Researching maternal and infant outcomes,"['Brown, Hilary']",['N/A'],"['Cohort Study', 'Epidemiology', 'Infant Health', 'Intellectual And Developmental Disability', 'Maternal Health']",135000.0,300477,"Intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) are life-long disabilities that become apparent during an individual's development and are characterized by impairments in cognitive and daily life functioning. It has been suggested that women with IDD are at risk for poor health outcomes during and after pregnancy compared to women without IDD. However, research is scarce, and there are no Canadian studies on this topic. The objectives of this research are to examine whether, compared to women without IDD, women with IDD are at increased risk for poor maternal and infant outcomes during childbirth and early infancy and to examine factors that may worsen or explain this risk. We will address these objectives using provincially collected Ontario health data from the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES). We will identify women with IDD from the Health Care Research in Developmental Disabilities program, which used ICES data and information from the Ontario Disability Support Program to identify individuals with IDD in Ontario. Women with IDD with deliveries between 2002 and 2012 will be compared to women without IDD who also delivered during that time. Guided by the Canadian Perinatal Surveillance System, we will measure maternal outcomes (caesarean delivery, severe disease or death during pregnancy and childbirth, hospital readmission after delivery) and infant outcomes (severe disease or death in the first month, hospital readmission after birth, failure to receive important vaccinations at 2, 4, and 6 months). Greater numbers of women with IDD are now living in the community. Healthcare providers are therefore likely to see more expectant or new mothers with IDD in their practices. This study will be the largest worldwide and the first in Canada. Our research will generate critical information on risks for poor maternal and infant outcomes for women with IDD that can be used to improve their health by supporting the development of appropriate care."
Developmental delay and school readiness in infants born near term: Is it time to redefine risk groups?,"['Brown, Hilary']",['N/A'],"['Child Development', 'Cohort Study', 'Developmental Delay', 'Gestational Age', 'Perinatal Epidemiology', 'School Readiness']",105000.0,206086,"While poor outcomes for early preterm infants are well-documented, research is beginning to show that infants born late preterm (33-36 weeks gestation) and the youngest of term infants, classified as early term (37-38 weeks gestation), are more disadvantaged than was previously thought. Recent studies have shown that these near term infants are at increased risk, compared to ""full"" term infants (39-41 weeks gestation), for morbidity and mortality at birth and for disability in childhood and adulthood. There is evidence that the brain goes through important maturation during the final weeks of gestation. It is therefore essential to more closely investigate neurodevelopmental outcomes of near term infants. The proposed study will use two sources of data to do so. The Prenatal Health Project is a longitudinal study which recruited pregnant mothers at 12-20 weeks gestation and followed up with infants at several time points. Data from this study will be used to determine whether late preterm and early term infants are at increased risk, compared to full term infants, for delays in development at 36-48 months. In a parallel investigation, data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth will be used to evaluate whether late preterm and early term infants are less likely to be ready for school at 48-60 months compared to their full term peers. Based on theories of the brain's development during gestation, we expect that late preterm infants will have worse outcomes than early term infants, when compared with full term infants. Because early term delivery is common, it is important to investigate these infants' outcomes in childhood so that high risk groups can be identified who should be followed closely. If parents and paediatricians are aware of the risks for these infants, they may be better equipped to monitor their development and, if needed, apply early interventions which will improve their health and well-being."

Affecting 20% of women, perinatal mental illness has serious negative consequences for mothers, infants, and families. Women at high risk for perinatal mental illness need to be identified early to avoid negative outcomes. Previous history of mental illness, stress, and lack of support are known to predict perinatal mental illness. Outside of the perinatal period, chronic medical conditions may be risk factors for mental illness. However, although 1 in 5 pregnant women have a chronic medical condition, the association between chronic medical conditions and perinatal mental illness is not fully understood. Our aim is to examine the impact of chronic medical conditions on the risk for mental illness during pregnancy or postpartum. We will use data collected from Ontario health records to identify all women who gave birth in Ontario between 2012 and 2014. We will identify women with and without chronic medical conditions (diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, chronic kidney disease, multiple sclerosis, and epilepsy). In our analyses, we will determine whether having a chronic medical condition increases risk for mental illness in pregnancy or in the first 12 months after delivery. We will identify specific maternal factors that worsen or explain any observed increased risk. Finally, we will determine whether chronic medical condition severity affects risk. Our findings will improve the health care delivery system: If there is an association between chronic medical conditions and perinatal mental illness, we will provide evidence needed to prioritize including mental health resources in obstetrical services.

Disabilities can be categorized as physical (e.g., spinal cord injuries), sensory (e.g., vision and hearing impairments), and intellectual and developmental (e.g., fetal alcohol syndrome). Until recently, childbearing rates among women with disabilities were low. With medical advances and better integration of persons with disabilities in the community, more women with disabilities are starting families. Women with disabilities experience high rates of poverty and poor health, and research is beginning to show that these factors increase their risk for poor pregnancy and later child outcomes. However, there is little research examining the health of their infants. Our aim is to compare access to health care, health, and mortality among infants born to women with and without disabilities. We will use data collected from Ontario medical records and documentation on disability support recipients to identify all infants born to women with and without disabilities in Ontario in 2009-2015. We will follow these infants to 12 months of age. In our analyses, we will determine whether infants born to women with disabilities overall and those born to women with physical, sensory, and intellectual and developmental disabilities specifically are at increased risk for missed well-baby visits, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and mortality. We will identify specific maternal social and health factors that worsen these risks, and pregnancy-related factors that explain them. Our findings will improve the health care delivery system: Evidence of increased risk for poor outcomes among infants born to women with disabilities will provide information needed to create specialized supports for women with disabilities and their infants.

Dysfunction in the immune system plays a key role in developing endometriosis lesions in various parts of the body (e.g., ovaries, bowel) which present in patients as disabling pelvic pain. Given the absence of a definitive cure, understanding risk factors is essential for facilitating early diagnosis and treatment that can slow endometriosis progression and enhance patients' quality of life. The proposed research will investigate whether adolescent onset of allergic (e.g., asthma) and psychiatric (e.g., depression) disorders, which share features of immune-related dysfunction and inflammation, may foreshadow females' risk of experiencing endometriosis over the lifespan. We will use over three decades of population-based data to create a cohort of all females born in Ontario between 1988-1998 that spans health and demographic records from birth through adulthood - the first of its kind in Canada. We will explore the association between allergic and psychiatric disorders in adolescence and endometriosis, including whether this association is unique to disorders diagnosed in adolescence versus other life stages (e.g., childhood); is specific to endometriosis versus other common gynecologic conditions with overlapping symptoms; and contributes appreciably to the population burden of endometriosis. Findings may be used to facilitate earlier diagnosis of endometriosis through targeting screening for gynecologic symptoms in high-risk adolescents and introducing a new predisposing factor to consider when endometriosis is suspected.

However, MCC is common even in women of reproductive age: 18% of 18 to 44-year-olds are affected. This suggests MCC may be important in pregnancy-related health. Yet, while a woman with a chronic condition is more likely to have pregnancy complications, research and health care focus on single chronic conditions rather than the combined effects of MCC. Our goal is to examine the impact of pre-pregnancy MCC on pregnancy complications, including maternal acute hospital care, severe complications and mortality, pregnancy loss, preterm birth, and small size for gestational age. We will use linked data from Ontario health records to identify all women with a pregnancy conceived in 2012-2020. We will examine women with multiple, one, and no chronic conditions. In our analyses, we will determine whether MCC increases the risk of pregnancy complications according to the number of chronic conditions, complexity of MCC, specific clusters of chronic conditions, and overall morbidity severity; and evaluate whether social and health care access inequities worsen the risk of pregnancy complications related to MCC. Our findings will improve the health care system: Evidence of increasing risk of pregnancy complications associated with a rising number of chronic conditions will lead to development of multidisciplinary health care services that address the full range of needs of women with MCC and their newborns.

However, our research shows that 1 in 8 pregnant women have co-occurring physical and mental health conditions. Outside of pregnancy, adults with physical-mental multimorbidity are more likely to require hospital care and die prematurely than those with a physical or mental health condition alone. They also experience challenges coordinating their medical and psychiatric care. How physical-mental multimorbidity plays out in pregnancy, however, is unknown in terms of pregnancy outcomes and care. We will use whole-population medical records data in Ontario to examine the impact of physical-mental multimorbidity on risks of pregnancy complications and chronic illness-related emergency department visits and hospital admissions in the perinatal period.

However, a growing number of girls and women are being diagnosed with autism. This makes an understanding of their unique health care needs critical for planning and delivering health care. Emerging research suggests autistic women experience important social, health, and health care disparities compared to non-autistic women, including elevated rates of poverty; co-occurring conditions like psychiatric disorders, intellectual disabilities, neurological disorders, and chronic physical conditions; and high rates of medication use. They also report significant health care access barriers related to communication difficulties with health care providers and sensory concerns. However, few studies have examined reproductive health in autistic women, despite these factors having known associations with adverse reproductive outcomes. We will use whole-population medical records data in Ontario, Canada, to examine the perinatal health outcomes of autistic women, including their risks of perinatal complications, health service use, and associated health care costs. We will also use in-depth interviews with autistic women with a birth in the last 7 years, as well as health and social service-providers, to understand the perinatal care experiences of autistic women and identify recommendations to improve care. Our study will generate data that will be useful for the development of evidence-based resources for pregnant autistic women and their health care providers.

"Efficacy of a digital school-based nutrition education intervention to improve healthy eating knowledge, attitudes and behaviours","['Brown, Jacqueline M']",['N/A'],"['Child Health', 'Mobile Health', 'Nutrition', 'Public Health']",105000.0,458474,"In Canada, many children do not consume a healthy diet, increasing their risk of developing obesity and other chronic diseases in both childhood and adulthood. One way to help promote healthier diets is through nutrition education in childhood. Research shows that the use of technology, such as mobile health (mHealth) apps (science-based apps developed for learning and health promotion), may improve nutrition education by creating more meaningful and impactful learning experiences for children. However, few mHealth apps that are nutrition-focused contain accurate information and are often not suitable for use in the classroom. Our research team (teachers, game developers, nutritionists) and our partners (Health Canada, school boards) developed Foodbot Factory, a mHealth app to teach elementary school children about healthy eating. Previous research demonstrated that children found Foodbot Factory highly engaging, easy to use and it significantly improved their nutrition knowledge. Building upon this existing research, the proposed project will allow us to understand if Foodbot Factory can be used in the classroom to improve healthy eating knowledge, attitudes and food intake in Grade 4 and 5 school children. To conduct this research, 28 classrooms across Ontario will be recruited and randomized (like the flip of a coin) to one of two groups: 1) to learn with Foodbot Factory in nutrition education lesson plans, or 2) to learn with a non-tech based activity (worksheets, teacher instruction, videos) in nutrition education lesson plans. In both study groups, we will measure nutrition knowledge and attitudes using a questionnaire (like a test) and food intake using a screener.

Combatting resistance is an international priority but surveillance of drug resistant infections is challenging due to the large number of bacteria, antibiotics, and laboratories involved, combined with suboptimal reporting mechanisms. In most jurisdictions, current surveillance systems rely on manually completed surveys submitted voluntarily by hospitals, meaning that the system is slow, labour intensive, prone to bias, and unable to measure the resistance in long-term care and outpatient settings. 

The COMBAT-AMR project will use the newly developed Ontario Laboratory Information System (OLIS) which is an electronic compilation of all patient test results from all laboratories in the province. Using OLIS, we will identify antibiotic resistance from the summary reports of all clinical microbiology culture specimens in the province. By linking OLIS to Ontario population databases, we will be able determine the total extent to which antimicrobial resistant infections contribute to hospitalization and death in Ontario by creating the Clinical Antibiotic Resistance Index (CARI). The CARI will be broken down by bacterium, region, healthcare sector, patient characteristics such as age and sex, and time, thereby revealing important bacteria and population subgroups where antibiotic resistance is of primary concern. 

The CARI will be the first index that accounts for the importance of antimicrobial resistance from the patients' perspective and will provide crucial evidence to inform clinical decisions and government policy for combatting resistance."
Searching for rigour in mixed methods health research: A methodological review,"['Brown, Kristin']",['N/A'],"['Methodological Rigour', 'Mixed Methods', 'Nutrition', 'Obesity', 'Physical Activity', 'Population Health', 'School Health']",1500.0,331684,"Rising obesity rates in children and youth have become a global public health concern given the increased risk of chronic disease in adult life. Schools are considered an ideal setting for obesity interventions since the target population can be reached daily. Yet characteristics of individual schools influence both intervention implementation and outcomes, suggesting we must explore the context these interventions occur within. Mixed methods (combining quantitative and qualitative methods) allow us to explore both intervention content (""what"") and context (""why"" and ""how""). However, to determine the strength of evidence derived from mixed methods studies, we must also evaluate the methodological rigour of such work. While guidance exists for assessing rigour in quantitative and qualitative methods individually, we find ourselves without a map for assessing rigour in mixed methods research.

This methodological review examined the school-based obesity intervention literature to explore how mixed methods approaches have been used and reported, as well as how rigour has been addressed. We identified twenty-three mixed methods studies through a search of the academic literature and assessed article quality using the guidelines for Good Reporting of a Mixed Methods Study (GRAMMS). Overall, there is a clear need for detailed reporting of mixed methods in school-based obesity intervention research. Detailed reporting would allow readers to better assess the quality of findings, which should lead to stronger evidence, improved research designs, and ultimately, better interventions. By improving the quality of mixed methods research evaluating school-based obesity interventions, we can understand which interventions will work best in individual school settings, in order to decrease child and youth obesity rates."

This study explores how researchers can work with schools and public health units to improve their students' health. COMPASS, a 4-year study of Ontario and Alberta high school students and schools, provided schools with tailored summaries of their students' health behaviours (e.g., nutrition, physical activity, and substance use) and researcher support to make changes to improve student health. We evaluated the impact of these knowledge translation strategies by using mixed methods (combining quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews). Results show these strategies led to collaboration between researchers, school staff, and public health practitioners, and changes in schools (e.g., new health programs and facilities). These findings can inform future research-practice partnerships to ultimately improve student health by understanding what schools and public health staff need to make school environments healthier."

The answer to this question is vital to preventing the annual loss of almost 1900 Canadians and $25 billion to Canadian taxpayers. Poor decision making (DM) is a neuropsychological construct associated with many destructive and persistent risky health behaviours such as alcohol and drug misuse, pathological gambling, risky sexual practices as well as DWI. In this study, adult male DWI offenders and healthy normal licensed drivers are recruited to participate in an experiment to better understand the decision making processes involved in DWI. We observe at their decision making related to DWI behaviour in a virtual reality driving environment and the role of alcohol intake plays on brain, neuropsychological and behavioural functions. This holistic perspective to DWI is novel and promises new insight into this deadline and persistent problem, and possibly innovative ways to prevent it."

Identification of likely recidivists is a vital preventative strategy as approximately 1/3 of first-time offenders are re-arrested within a couple of years. Research has failed to produce accurate assessment procedures for recidivism prediction. The research has also ignored an important consideration in the assessment of risk. That is, should our statistical predictions err on the side of severity to detect most high-risk offenders, but at the expense of falsely designating more low-risk offenders as high risk? Or should they err on the side of tolerance, and detect most low-risk offenders, but at the expense of falsely designating more high-risk offenders as low risk? We use a depersonalized provincial database of thousands of first-time offenders in Quebec to track and statistically predict which first-time offenders recommit DWI offences in the 5-6 years following their first conviction. We also conduct focus groups of stakeholders in the DWI assessment procedure (e.g., drivers, offenders, lawyers, judges, advocates, licensing program administrators) to understand their positions regarding the appropriate severity/tolerance balance.  This ratio is then incorporated into practical guidelines of risk assessment based upon both statistical evidence and community orientations. In this way, this study contributes to development of evidence-informed DWI decision-making and ultimately, a reduction of DWI-related morbidity in Canada. Collaboration with licensing authorities in Quebec promises not only to enhance relevance of the findings, but also to expedite technology transfer into the field."
Effects of sleep deprivation with low blood alcohol levels on executive functions in young drivers.,"['Brown, Thomas G']","['Bechara, Antoine', 'Bhatti, Junaid A', 'Gruber, Reut', 'Ouimet, Marie Claude', 'Tremblay, Jacques']","['Decision Making', 'Drink Driving', 'Driving Simulation', 'Executive Functions', 'Hazard Perception', 'Neurodevelopment', 'Prefrontal Cortex', 'Road Traffic Crashes', 'Sleepiness', 'Young Drivers']",370962.0,255141,"According to the World Health Organization, road traffic crashes are the leading cause of mortality in young adults (< 25 yrs.). Driving while impaired by alcohol and sleep deprivation are two frequently observed crash causes in young drivers. About one-third of the young Canadian drivers who died in traffic crashes involving alcohol had legal blood alcohol concentration (i.e. BAC < 0.08%). The sleep deprivation in young adults is common, and is expected to intensify their crash vulnerability even at legal low BAC. In particular, both sleep and alcohol may diminish underlying cognitive capabilities critical for safe driving, namely decision-making and hazard perception, but their combined effect on these systems in young drivers is unknown. As these cognitive capacities undergo significant development in young people under 25, with their rate and nature of development differing between males and females, both age and gender may be additional vulnerability factors. This study aims to clarify to how and to what degree sleep deprivation combined with low, legal levels of alcohol consumption influences driving in young drivers than either of these conditions alone or when rested and sober. Young male and female drivers aged 18-34 years will be subjected to either of 4 conditions: 1) rested and sober, 2) sleep deprivation, 3) low BAC (0.03%), 4) combined sleep deprivation and low BAC. The impact of these 4 conditions will be assessed on safe driving capacities using driving simulation, and on hazard perception and decision-making using neuropsychological testing. Age and gender effects will be explored in relation with maturation of neurocognitive functioning. The results will inform policy-making (e.g. extension of zero tolerance, graduated licensing with night-time restriction) and public health interventions (e.g. targeted awareness). This would contribute to the reduction in the catastrophic impact of traffic crashes on the health of young Canadians."

The impact of gender role conflict on the relationship between internalized heterosexism and unprotected anal intercourse among gay men: Testing a moderator effect,"['Brown, Tyler L']",['N/A'],"['Gay Men', 'Gender Role Conflict', 'Health Risk Behavior', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Internalized Heterosexism', 'Intersectionality Framework', 'Masculinity', 'Moderator Effect', 'Stress And Coping', 'Unprotected Anal Intercourse']",52500.0,277479,"Internalized heterosexism (IH) occurs when LGBTQ people internalized negative societal attitudes toward their own sexual orientation. In past research, IH and the stress that accompanies it has frequently been used to explain unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) among gay men, a group at increased risk for contracting HIV. A recent review of this research has shown that the link between IH and UAI among gay men is generally small and has decreased with time. Although, these recent findings challenge the usefulness of earlier IH-UAI research, advances in gender and health research may offer a context for the continued utility of IH as a predictor of UAI among gay men. While gender and health research has found evidence for the influence of masculinity on heterosexual men's sexual health practices, similar research on the sexual health practices of gay men has not been investigated. 

In the proposed study, we investigate whether adherence to traditional masculinity supports the link between IH and UAI among gay men. The influence of adherence to traditional masculinity may be especially problematic for gay men in terms of risky sexual behavior because of masculine taboos against affectionate behavior between men. Gay men with greater adherence to traditional masculinity may engage in more UIA because taking precautions to safeguard their health and the health of their sexual partner(s) may be seen as feminine given that it may suggest that they are affectionately concerned about the well-being of other men. Thus, the link between IH and UAI will be greater among gay men who adhere to traditional masculinity. 

A major application of the proposed study is in HIV intervention among gay men. If the proposed study finds that the link between IH and UIA is greater among gay men with increased adherence to traditional masculinity then, HIV interventions can be designed to focus on the IH and masculine experiences of gay men to reduce UIA."

The majority of fatal crashes are caused by speeding, driving after using alcohol, and distracted driving. British Columbia recently changed its Motor Vehicle Act with laws that target these dangerous behaviours. These new laws, the strictest in North America, include immediate and severe penalties for impaired driving, speeding, or driving while using a cell phone. By targeting the underlying causes of most motor vehicle crashes, these laws have the potential to prevent many traffic injuries and deaths.

Our team of researchers works closely with road safety administrators including the BC Superintendent of Motor Vehicles, and with community stakeholders including the British Columbia Automobile Association, the Insurance Corporation of BC, and The Community Against Preventable Injuries, an injury prevention social marketing organization. We propose to conduct an in depth evaluation of the recent changes to BC's Motor Vehicle Act. 

The effectiveness of traffic laws may vary depending on many factors such as public awareness of and compliance with the laws, the number of traffic police, how aggressively police enforce the laws, and availability of alternate modes of transportation. These factors may vary from region to region and from time to time. Our evaluation will make use of many sources of road injury data including insurance claims, police crash reports, ambulance records, the hospital admissions. We will investigate whether the number of crashes or injuries decreased after the new laws went into effect and we will determine whether the factors mentioned above had an influence on this outcome.

Cannabis may not be dangerous for supervised medical cannabis patients (SMCPs) who take it with physician supervision. SMCPs are older, use lower doses of THC and may develop tolerance. We will use a driving simulator to study how cannabis impacts driving performance in SMCPs who take cannabis for pain, sleep, anxiety or depression.

Methods: SMCPs will drive a simulator, complete cognitive tests and have blood THC and CBD levels measured. To assess long-term changes in driving performance, SMCPs will drive a simulator before cannabis therapy and at 1 and 4 months after starting. We will examine how driving performance changes after starting cannabis therapy and whether SMCPs who use prescribed cannabis with high vs low THC content perform differently. To assess acute impairment, we will examine whether driving performance changes immediately after inhaling or ingesting prescribed cannabis containing THC. SMCPs will drive a simulator before and ½, 2, 4, and 6 hours after taking their prescribed THC-containing cannabis. We will compare their driving before and after cannabis use. We will also assess whether SMCPs who inhale vs ingest cannabis perform differently. Finally, we will identify risk factors for driving impairment (e.g. age, sex, gender, THC dose, use of other medications). We will use statistical models to assess whether these factors are related to driving performance.

Outcomes: This will be the first large study of the effect of cannabis on driving performance in SMCPs. The results will help SMCPs understand when it's safe to drive after using cannabis. It will also help healthcare providers advise SMCPs about driving and identify patients at risk of driving impairment. This research is also relevant for people who set traffic policy because we will show how often SMCPs have THC above legal limits and whether this is related to driving performance."

Many drivers use medications that slow reaction time, cloud judgment and impair the skills required for safe driving. This problem may be increasing because of an aging population and increased use of impairing medications. Young drivers are also at high risk of crashing and may be particularly susceptible to the effects of impairing medications. Unfortunately, despite international efforts, the risk to road safety associated with most medications is poorly understood. This lack of knowledge prevents authorities from developing effective policy, public education campaigns, and medication warning labels designed to prevent people from driving while using impairing medications. 

Numerous studies have investigated the crash risk associated with prescription medications and some progress has already been made. European experts developed a consensus document that classifies medications according to suspected crash risk. Unfortunately, for most medications, there is little real world evidence to show whether or not they really increase the chance of crashing. Therefore this classification is based mostly on expert opinion and may be inaccurate.

In this project, we will study the association of all major classes of prescription medications with crashes. We will do this by linking driver records and police crash reports with prescription records. This rich data will allow us to overcome many of the limitations of previous research. We will use sophisticated methods to find out if drivers who take medications are more likely to crash than other drivers and if they are more likely to crash when using medications than at other times.

Most experts believe that higher speed limits are dangerous, but some believe that increased speed limits on selected highways may actually make travel safer.

On July 2, 2014, the BC government increased speed limits on 9% of BC's paved highways. The maximum speed in BC was increased to 120 kph - the highest in Canada. They said that their goal was to make roads safer. We propose a comprehensive evaluation of BC's new speed limits. We will study collisions, ambulance calls for road trauma, injuries, and fatalities occurring on the affected road segments. We will account for downward trends in the road trauma rate and will compare BC's record with records from Alberta and Washington state. We will also study the effects of the speed limit changes on traffic speed. Our evaluation will consider the possible effects of speed spillover (where increased speed limits on a major road result in increased travel speed on nearby roads). We will also study the effect of increased speed limits on winter road trauma.

Our main objective is to determine how the July 2014 speed limit changes in BC affected the number of motor vehicle crashes on the highway segments where the speed limit was increased. 

Other provinces may follow BC's lead and increase their speed limits. Therefore, it is very important that the speed limit changes in BC be thoroughly studied and that lawmakers and the public know the outcome.

Disability after an injury is a major public health concern, but the long term health outcome after road trauma is poorly investigated and based mostly on outdated research that does not reflect modern vehicle safety features or modern medical treatment, and largely ignored cyclists and pedestrians. In addition, there is almost no research that helps healthcare providers know which patients are most likely to have a bad outcome following a crash - making it difficult to provide them with the care they require. It is important for policy makers to know the healthcare costs and lost productivity that results from road trauma, but this information has not been well studied. Our study will provide this missing information.

METHODS: We will interview patients who visit an emergency department after a car crash. The interview will ask about their general health before the crash, the injuries they had from the crash, and other details of the crash. We will interview them again at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months after the crash to find out about problems they had since the crash. The follow-up interview will ask about pain, ability to go about their usual activities, whether they have returned to work, and about the medical care they required after the crash.

STUDY FINDINGS and IMPORTANCE: Our study will help doctors and nurses know how quickly people recover from their injuries and which patients are likely to have long term health problems after a car crash.

Unfortunately, pedestrians and cyclists are vulnerable in the event of a fall or collision and fear of injury acts as a deterrent. Knowledge of the circumstances of
active transport injuries is limited because traffic statistics do not count all of these injuries, especially when a motor vehicle is not involved. As a result city planners do not know where these events occur, why they occur or which types of bike lanes or crosswalks (for example)
put pedestrians or cyclists at greatest risk. There is also limited research on outcome following an active transport injury so doctors and nurses do not know which injured patients are at greatest risk of poor recovery. 

METHODS: Our study will provide this missing information. We will study 1800 pedestrians and cyclists (including people using e-scooters or e-bikes) who are treated in hospital after an injury. Interviews will determine the circumstances of the injury (where it happened, whether a motor vehicle was involved, features of the road or sidewalk that may have contributed to the injury).

People who drive while sleepy perform poorly in driving simulators and are more likely to crash in real life. Canadian nurses are often scheduled to work consecutive 12-hour night-shifts, which leads to insufficient sleep and poor sleep quality. Therefore, nurses may be at elevated risk of motor vehicle crashes, especially while driving home after a night-shift. Sleepy driving in nurses has mainly been studied using logbooks and interviews, outside of Canada, and before Covid-19. We will use a high-fidelity driving simulator to study the safety of driving after a series of night-shifts in nurses working in a Canadian hospital. We will also investigate factors that improve (e.g., out of hospital responsibilities, more consecutive shifts, cancelled breaks) or worsen (e.g., sleep breaks, caffeine) driving performance.

Methods: Registered nurses (RNs) will drive a simulator and complete cognitive tests over two sessions: i) after three or more consecutive days off work, and ii) after four consecutive days of work (the last two of which are 12-hour night-shifts). RNs will also wear actigraphs, which measure sleep duration, and keep a diary of their sleep and activity during the study. We will examine how driving and cognitive performance changes after a series of 12-hour night-shifts by comparing results from the two sessions. We will also identify factors that improve or worsen driving performance.

Outcomes: The results of this study will help nurses, hospital administrators, nurse unions, and regulatory groups understand whether it is safe for nurses to drive home after night-shifts. Identifying factors that improve or worsen driving performance will also inform preventive measures (e.g., sleep breaks while working a night-shift)."

Most Baffin Island women are required to fly out of their communities to Iqaluit or Ottawa for birth, and may have to remain in distant hospitals for weeks or months (referred to as obstetric evacuation). This obstetric evacuation can have serious impacts on the overall health and well-being of a mother and child, but also that of her family and community, who find it challenging to connect emotionally with a newborn after missing the birthing event. Few studies have examined how Inuit psychological, emotional, and spiritual connections to the land influence both their health outcomes and childbirth experiences. The proposed research will explore how the health of mothers and infants may vary based on birth location, and how Inuit experience the health system, given the reality of obstetric evacuation. A cross-sectional study will be used to determine the prevalence of maternal and infant health issues among women who give birth at home, Iqaluit, and Ottawa.

Both of these related conditions are the cause of decreased quality of life, increased morbidity and premature mortality.  The increased disease prevalence among Canadian First Nation people began to be noted in the 1980's.  Since that time the problem has been worsening; diabetes and cardiovascular disease among First Nation people begin at earlier ages and are associated with a higher prevalence of complications than among the general population.  Established risk factors for these conditions include family history, unhealthy diet, inactivity, obesity, smoking and hypertension.  Disease prevention interventions are required but need careful planning. One factor that has not yet been explored in adequate detail is the impact of stress on disease and risk factor occurrence.  The social circumstances shared by many First Nations people are sources of profound stress.  We have previously developed a stress questionnaire that incorporates aspects of life on a First Nation community that were not part of existing stress questionnaires.  Using our questionnaire we were able to determine aspects of stress at the individual, family and community level.  We found that these stressors were associated with disease independent of established risk factors, in other words above and beyond obesity, smoking and hypertension.  The purpose of the proposed research is to further explore the role of stress, a non-traditional risk factor, among the same group of people who participated in earlier studies.  This follow-up will allow us to better understand the role of stress in disease and risk factor occurrence which will help us design more comprehensive, targeted and relevant disease prevention interventions."

Risk factors for diabetes include family history, unhealthy diet, inactivity, and obesity.  Recent research is pointing to the role of chronic stress in the development of diabetes.   Large diabetes prevention interventions have demonstrated that among those at highest risk the progression to diabetes can be slowed or reduced with lifestyle modifications, specifically diet and exercise. Given that chronic stress is emerging as an independent risk factor for diabetes, stress reduction may help in diabetes prevention.  Therefore, the purpose of this research is to expand our knowledge on the role of stress in the development of diabetes, and to identify new points for intervention aimed at stress reduction.

Injection drug use is one of the main drivers of these two epidemics worldwide. The reasons why persons who inject drugs (PWID) engage in behaviours that put themselves and others at risk of HIV and HCV extend beyond rational decisions based on knowledge or the provision of resources such as clean syringes and injection materials. Epidemiological studies suggest that mental health disorders are highly prevalent in PWIDs and indirect evidence supports their role as major determinants of risk behaviour. There is scarce data, however, on the specific effect of mental health on transmission risk factors as well as on HIV and HCV incidences. 
Building on our current work and ongoing collaborations, The main goal of this proposal is to examine relationships between mental health problems, including psychiatric diagnoses and mental health states (impulsivity, anxiodepressive symptoms, psychological distress and craving), and HCV/HIV transmission among PWIDs. 
To achieve our goals, we will continue to follow at 3-month intervals active PWIDs in a prospective cohort study in Montreal. Interview-administered questionnaires, validated mental health measures and blood samples to test for HCV virus particles and antibodies, and HIV antibodies will be collected at each visit. Data will be analysed by statistical techniques allowing examining the relations between variables of interest and HIV/HCV infections overtime.
Consistent with the importance of exploiting the richness of this long-lived longitudinal study, we will continue and expand our participation in national and international research initiatives on the aetiology and pathogenesis of HCV/HIV infections, and on vaccine development."

Despite considerable prevention efforts, HIV incidence in Montreal injection drug users (IDUs) remains among the highest for North American cities, and studies have shown modest or no effect of HIV prevention programs on HCV transmission. In Montreal, up to one in three IDU will contract HCV in the next year, and these figures do not include re-infections. There is a crucial need to estimate the true burden of HCV infection among IDUs and to better assess the determinants of HCV/HIV infections to improve prevention efforts. We recently demonstrated that high-risk injection behaviour among IDUs living in Montreal was associated with neighbourhood educational attainment and low income, and that IDUs living in socioeconomic disadvantaged areas or with a high level of crimes were at higher risk of acquiring HCV. Cumulative duration of injection appeared to influence such relationships. Following acute infection, approximately 26% of recently infected individuals spontaneously clear HCV. Hence, a key question for future HCV vaccine development is whether protective immunity against HCV occurs after HCV clearance.
This renewal application seeks to further investigate how individual and contextual factors constitute key potential influences that may exacerbate or attenuate the rate of viral transmission, thereby presenting opportunities for intervention. We will also expand the scope of our research by studying the course of HCV infection, including primary infection, re-infection and clearance among injection drug users."

Largely concentrated in cities, PWID are disproportionately exposed to housing vulnerability, with up to 60% of those living in large North American cities reporting recent unstable housing. Access to safe and stable housing is a well-established determinant of health and has gained renewed focus as a structural target for intervention following the limited success of conventional public health approaches to reducing morbidity and mortality in PWID.
Data on mortality rates and trends among PWID are particularly scarce in Canada. Further, despite evidence for a broadly deleterious impact on PWID health, relationships between unstable housing and mortality are not well understood. This study seeks to examine mortality rates and refine our understanding of the relationship between these aspects living context and mortality, and ultimately guide policies and interventions that address inequalities related to housing stability and service distribution within our cities.
This study will capitalize on data collected as part of St. Luc/HEPCO, one of the largest prospective cohort studies of PWID, having recruited more than 4000 participants since 1992, with detailed assessment of behavioral and service use data, as well as geospatial and laboratory data. Mortality and causes of death among cohort participants will be obtained via record linkage with the Institut de la Statistique du Québec.
This project will improve our understanding of how housing contexts influence this ultimate health outcome. Findings will be relevant to city planners and community organisations seeking to allocate housing solutions and services in a manner that supports our most vulnerable citizens."

Promoting PA is an important public health strategy, and while active transportation to/from school (ATS) could be an important way to increase PA, currently only one in four children walks to school, compared to more than one half just a generation ago. School Travel Planning (STP) is a comprehensive process that promotes young students and their families to use ATS instead of inactive modes of commuting by eliminating the barriers for children to safely walk or cycle to school. Past research on STP comes from large urban and suburban areas, and while it shows promise for improving PA levels, there is lack of evidence of its effect in smaller rural and northern communities. The objective of our research is to assess the implementation and impact of a STP intervention in participating elementary schools in the North Bay Parry Sound District on ATS and PA in children in a small-medium sized population center in a northern context. Our secondary objective is to assess the impact of the STP intervention on mental health indicators of children engaging in ATS. We will use a variety of methods, including observations, interviews, surveys, and objective measures of PA (i.e. accelerometers and global positioning systems) to: (1) explore facilitators and barriers to ATS among students; (2) evaluate the impact of the STP intervention; (3) measure and track changes in PA and active travel behaviours; and (4) evaluate the influence of ATS on mental health indicators among students (junior kindergarten to grade 8).

While more than 80% of AYA are expected to live at least 5 years after their cancer is diagnosed, most will experience disease symptoms and treatment side effects that can compromise length and quality of survival. Research shows that physical activity (PA) can improve the length and quality of life of survival for children and adults diagnosed with cancer. Yet, research with AYA - a population recognized as being unique -remains insufficient to endorse PA as a complementary therapy to help AYA manage disease symptoms and treatment side effects from diagnosis into post-treatment survivorship. Also, while most AYA are insufficiently active from diagnosis onwards, knowledge of factors that influence PA is insufficient to develop effective and efficient interventions. Longitudinal studies in AYA diagnosed with cancer are needed to address these gaps, and to adapt, develop, and evaluate intervention strategies to promote PA and ultimately survival. Since a longitudinal study with AYA can be challenging, it is vital to carefully plan it to ensure its success. Hence, the goal of this project is to use Canada's Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research Patient Engagement framework to plan a longitudinal study by setting priorities for research questions and identify strategies that will facilitate recruitment and optimize retention of AYA diagnosed with cancer. The planning team will engage researchers, AYA diagnosed with cancer, decision-makers, and health care providers - collectively referred to as partners. Through a series of meetings, teleconferences, and focus groups, partners will work together to share their knowledge, expertise, and experience. The knowledge gained from partners during the planning phase and continued collaboration will facilitate the development and conduct of the study, as well as the mobilization of the results to promote PA to reduce the burden of cancer for AYA."

Major depression disorder (MDD) affects 2-9% of adolescents and more girls than boys are diagnosed with MDD. Further, 1 in 5 adolescents experience depressive symptoms but do not meet full MDD criteria. Adolescent MDD and depressive symptoms must be taken seriously since symptomatic adolescents have poorer educational, behavioural, and health outcomes than do asymptomatic adolescents, and since both persist into and recur in adulthood if untreated. Genetic and lifestyle factors can contribute to the development of depressive symptoms. We will use data from an existing cohort of adolescents followed from age 12 to 30 with already available genome-wide data to (1) identify genetic variants associated with depressive symptoms in adolescents (i.e., when symptom onset often occurs), (2) examine how genetics and lifestyle factors (i.e., physical activity; PA) interact to affect depressive symptoms by testing if the effects of genetics on depressive symptoms is diminished in adolescents who are more active for longer periods of time at higher-intensities, and (3) assess if there are sex differences. This knowledge will lead to a better understanding of the etiology of depressive symptoms in adolescence and may shed light on which subgroups of adolescents might benefit most from PA intervention and when. This is key to allowing health care providers to target and tailor PA interventions to adolescents who will benefit most at time periods in the life course when interventions will be most effective."

2.To better understand the contributions of individual and contextual factors as determinants of outdoor risky play through geographically and socially mapping access to play spaces.
3.To reframe population level perceptions of risk and injury prevention through social marketing to promote outdoor risky play.

Unintentional injuries from causes such as motor vehicle crashes and falls are the leading cause of death and the fourth leading cause of hospitalization for Canadian children. Parents play a large role in limiting children's injury risks, but parents' roles differ substantially and require investigation. For example, fathers allow children to do activities that mothers may perceive as too dangerous. Most research has been carried out with mothers, leaving large gaps in our understanding of paternal impact on child injury. Several factors must be considered: notions of masculinity (e.g., 'injuries help make you tougher') may affect the way that fathers parent their children; fathers treat their girls and boys differently, encouraging boys to take more risks; and views on masculinity vary substantially in different geographic, cultural and political places. We will be interviewing fathers and mothers of children aged 2 to 7 years to better understand fathering related to child unintentional injury prevention. The places we will be studying include rural and urban areas in British Columbia and Quebec. Our research questions address how fathering as it relates to childhood unintentional injury prevention is influenced by perceptions of masculinity, gender roles and contextual factors including culture and geography.

Levelling the playing fields: Will the provision of risk and natural play opportunities provide more equitable playgrounds?,"['Brussoni, Mariana J', 'Herrington, susan']",['N/A'],"['Boys Health', 'Designing For Play', 'Gendered Play', 'Natural Play Environments', 'Risky Play']",21986.0,284219,"There are detrimental effects on child development when too many restrictions are placed on children's outdoor risky play and access to natural environments. Despite this, recent generations of children have seen their natural play environments substituted with pre-fabricated play spaces that optimize safety and risk reduction with little regard for children's develop¬mental and play needs. Furthermore, evidence indicates that if children, especially boys, do not have sufficient outdoor risky play opportunities, they will seek them elsewhere, potentially in more dangerous environments. Thus, the current dominant approach to playground design-which is intended to minimize risk-eliminates healthy and supervised risky play opportunities, paradoxically placing children at increased risk of injury.   
We are developing a new interdisciplinary research initiative called CHILD'S Play (Creating Healthy Inspiring Landscape Designed Spaces for Play), which ultimately aims to develop recommendations for playground design that incorporate developmentally-necessary and gender-neutral risky play in natural environments. The first aspect of the collaboration is this planning grant, Levelling the playing fields, which examines whether risky play opportunities with natural elements provide (i) more equitable playgrounds for all genders overall and (ii) more developmental opportunities for boys, in particular. Our proposal for this CIHR planning grant will seek to understand the existing body of work in this area and develop intersectoral partnerships and international collaborations to develop a research proposal for CHILD'S Play."
Canadian fathering and child unintentional injury prevention,"['Brussoni, Mariana J']","['George, Anne M', 'Maurice, Pierre', 'Oliffe, John L']","['Child Injury Prevention', 'Fathers', 'Gender', 'Masculinity', 'Qualitative']",351543.0,211207,"Unintentional injuries, such as car crashes and falls, are the leading health concern - more Canadian children and youth die of injuries than from all other causes combined. Gender and geography have a significant impact on injury rates, with males and rural residents at greater risk. Parents play a large role in limiting children's injury risks. Fathers and mothers parenting roles are different in ways that may influence their attitudes and practices regarding child injury prevention. For example, fathers may allow children to engage in activities that mothers may consider dangerous. Fathers' unique role in encouraging exploration and risk taking requires investigation. Fathering is impacted by notions of masculinity, which is in turn influenced by broader contexts such as geography, society, and family. Our research questions address how fathering as it relates to childhood unintentional injury prevention is influenced by perceptions of masculinity, gender roles and contextual factors. We will be interviewing fathers and mothers of children aged 2 to 7 years to better understand fathering related to child unintentional injury prevention. The places we will be studying include rural and urban areas in British Columbia and Quebec. The results will help build theory, and guide research and prevention efforts. Findings will be applied to parenting programs, will help target prevention efforts and develop evidence-based policies and programs."

Whether jumping in a pile of leaves, catching bugs, or climbing a tree, children are often happiest when playing freely outdoors. Play is a childhood need so basic, it is enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, yet time for play has been increasingly eroded. Increasing evidence indicates the importance of outdoor play time for children's health and well-being. Our research seeks to gain the perspective of children aged 10-13 years and their parents on why they are motivated - or not - to play outside. We will use children's and parents' perspectives to develop an index of the playability of outdoor environments - the extent to which a given environment is friendly for outdoor play. An environment with high playability is easily and safely accessible and contains stimulating play opportunities. Girls and boys prioritize different aspects of their environment for play, so we expect to develop different indices of playability for girls compared to boys, and parents vs. children. We will test the relationship between the playability index and the health and well-being of children living in cities across Canada. The playability index will be useful for designing our urban environments to meet children's needs and positively influence their health."

Homeless individuals rarely have control over factors that impact their health within agencies like shelters and drop-in centres. The policies and practices enacted by agencies - like communal sleeping, bathing, and eating, use of inadequate ventilation systems, and infrequent disinfection of common areas - can be detrimental to the health of service-users, particularly in times of pandemic outbreak when the risk of disease transmission is increased. In 2009 and 2010 the Canadian Institutes of Health Research funded two studies investigating the capacity of homelessness sectors across Canada to manage pandemic outbreaks. The H1N1 pandemic served as a case study for analysis. In Toronto, interviews and surveys were conducted with 149 homeless persons, 15 social service providers, and 5 key stakeholders, to better understand the strengths and weaknesses of the collective homelessness sector response. Among the most pressing of the findings was that social service providers feel inadequately prepared to address pandemic outbreaks, given their lack of training as health care workers. This dissemination grant will be used to increase pandemic preparedness capacity within Ontario-based homelessness sectors, through a series of knowledge translation initiatives. Forty individuals, including researchers, policy makers, social service providers, and persons with lived experience of homelessness, will be hosted at a one day educational workshop, on May 12 2015, in Toronto. The workshop will include presentations about the research findings, group discussions, and a panel discussion between pandemic preparedness experts at the municipal, provincial, and federal levels. Following the workshop, video and plain language written outputs will be made freely available on the Homeless Hub website. The knowledge shared will improve pandemic preparedness for those in the homelessness sector."

More recently, the abuse of prescription opioids (POs) has captured media headlines and the attention of the medical community. Since the early 2000s, the rate of prescribing opioids has increased close to one hundred-fold and more Canadians are now dying of accidental overdoses from POs than from street drugs such as heroin and cocaine. 

Prevention efforts are needed urgently, but detecting individuals likely to experience a PO overdose is currently difficult, as there is little research to suggest how these people are unique. Our goal is to identify personal characteristics and patterns of healthcare use associated with unintentional death from PO overdose. 

Identification of characteristics associated with PO overdose is a critical first step towards developing methods for detecting individuals in need of timely intervention and directing these high-risk individuals to appropriate clinical and social services.

We propose to use health data from multiple sources, including the Coroner's Office, hospital records and drug prescribing databases, to identify characteristics of PO abusers who are likely to die from an accidental overdose. This information should allow public health policy-makers to optimize treatment services and harm reduction efforts."

Instead, they use statistical algorithms that screen the data automatically and issue alerts to draw an epidemiologist's attention to potential disease outbreaks.
It is well recognized that not all of these algorithms perform equally well when it comes to detecting outbreaks quickly and accurately. Moreover, the same algorithm may perform better or worse under different conditions. To ensure the effectiveness of automated surveillance systems, it is important to understand the factors that determine the performance of detection algorithms and to select the best algorithm for a given context. 
The goal of this project is to evaluate the performance of different outbreak detection algorithms, by experimenting with different algorithms and different types of surveillance data and then analyzing the results of these experiments.

Canada has a strong international reputation for the quality and impact of its pain research, and for innovations in care and educational programs. However these are  often 'siloed' and not generally available. The Canadian Pain Task Force has identified a need for improvement in public awareness of pain, access to care, education of healthcare and other professionals and a need to better inform healthcare policy about pain. The CIHR through its Strategy for Patient Oriented Research in 2016 supported the creation of Canada's first national pain research network- the Chronic Pain Network (CPN). Patient partners are integrated into the network governance and into the process of research, from establishing priorities through conduct of research and on to dissemination of results. Policy makers have also reached out to the CPN to obtain a pain patient perspective on issues such as the response to the opioid crisis. Sex, gender and culture have significant impact upon pain and its care, and there has been an increased awareness of the Indigenous perspective on health research in  general and the experience of pain in particular. Building on relationships and knowledge from the CPN and in collaboration with experts in Knowledge Mobilization and Implementation Science, this next phase of the CPN will disseminate knowledge to the public, to healthcare professional education and clinical practice, to organizations and into policy.

"Assessing caregiver influence on cortical, cardiac, and behavioural indicators of pain-related distress: New frontiers in neonatal pain assessment","['Bucsea, Oana']",['N/A'],"['Caregiver-Infant Relationships', ""Children'S Health"", 'Infant Pain', 'Pain Assessment', 'Prematurity']",105000.0,416824,"Infants hospitalized in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) are exposed daily to painful procedures as part of their routine medical care. Due to these infants' inability to report their own pain, it is crucial that health care professionals have accurate pain assessment tools to enact optimal pain management. Unrelieved pain has been shown to alter brain structures and functioning, resulting in poorer long-term physical and psychological outcomes for the 8% of children who are born premature every year. 

Early in life, due to their developing ability to calm themselves down after distress, infants heavily rely on their caregivers to help regulate from distressing events, like needles. When infants are in pain, they are very sensitive to the way in which their caregivers respond to their distress, cognitively, behaviourally and physiologically, because they are learning from their caregivers how to react and regulate from distress. Caregivers also set the social-emotional context in which infants experience distress. Seminal longitudinal work from our lab showed that caregivers were the most influential factor predicting pain responses from infancy to preschool.  By influencing the development of infants' pain responses, caregivers impact the way infant pain will be assessed and consequently managed. The proposed project takes this work and sets out to examine these relationships in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs). The present study will collect caregiver cognitive, behavioural, and physiological data during a routine blood sampling procedure in NICUs (a heel lance) and examine the relationships with infant brain responses (Electroencephalogram), heart responses (Electrocardiograms) and behaviour (facial activity). By furthering our understanding of how caregivers impact the way infants react and regulate from pain-related distress, this program of research seeks to improve the accuracy of current infant pain assessment practices used in NICUs."

Plants are used as both preventative medicines, being taken regularly as part of the diet, and as treatment for illness, disease and injury. The lvmlaomen of Lil'wat have extensive gendered components to them that need to be better understood at a community level in order for knowledge transmission to occur with the next generation.
Because of the ongoing legacy of colonialism, including the Residential School System and forced conversion to Christianity, the cultural understandings about gender of the Lil'wat people have been impacted. Though it is known that there were historically always other-gendered Lil'wat7ul, Ucwalmicwts (the Lil'wat language) words and understandings for these identities has been lost at a community level. There is also a need to create advocacy and support for LGBTQI2s+ Lil'wat7ul. 
This research scoping project will look to assess the feasibility of Lil'wat Lvmlaomen Tsipun (Medicine Shed) to aid in the strengthening and renewal of cultural protocols for creating safe, gender inclusive spaces. The research team, composed of two Lil'wat Nation researchers and a UBC Phd researcher, will host a series of community meetings, interviews with elders and knowledge keepers, and field visits to assess the potential of creating the Lil'wat Medicine Shed. This research will be guided by the S7itsken, the Lil'wat Research Protocol, and use a community-based action research methodology and Indigenous research methods."
Lil'wat Medicine Shed: Supporting Traditional Medicine Usage and Traditional Knowings of Gender,"['Bulkan, Janette']",['N/A'],"['Gender And Wellness', ""Indigenous Peoples' Health"", 'Lgbtqi2s+ Health', 'Traditional Medicine']",138472.0,450126,"The traditional medicines of the Lil'wat Nation have a gendered aspect, with traditional roles, ceremonies and medicines being associated with gender identities and roles. However, there is an increasing awareness amongst Lil'wat community members that binary gender is a legacy of colonialism. Moreover, Lil'wat community members have identified a need to support community learning and education about gender and sexuality to build knowledge and acceptance for members of the community who identify as Two Spirit or LGBTQIA+. This initiative proposes to build support, education and awareness about gender and sexuality into traditional medicine practices, as part of the Lil'wat Cultural Re-Connection Classroom. This proposed work that has been identified by the project Elder and Elder-in-Training, both of whom are Lil'wat community members. 
During this 3-year long initiative, Lil'wat and UBC Researchers, will pilot a new community institution that envisioned to be a place where Lil'wat youth can come together to engage in topics related to culture, gender, sexuality, and take part in traditional medicine harvest and processing and other culturally based activities that promote health and wellness. This research will work to generate indicators to gauge Lil'wat youth health and wellness, particularly in protective factors related to cultural continuity. We are requesting support for the hiring of Lil'wat Nation members as researchers and consultants to initiate the design of activities and services that will be offered from Years 1-3, along with support for materials and to invite Two Spirit leaders from other Indigenous communities to visit the Lil'wat Cultural Re-Connection Classroom as guest speakers and presenters and Lil'wat Elders to lead traditional medicine activities. This initiative is anticipated to bring significant long-term gains for the Lil'wat Nation to enhance knowledge and capacity around the intersections of gender, sexuality and wellness."
The Study of Ageism in the Workplace and Labour Market: Summer Program in Aging 2024 Proposal (Amanda Bull),"['Bull, Amanda']",['N/A'],"['Ageism', 'Labour', 'Older Adults', 'Qualitative', 'Work']",916.0,497408,"Ageism is experienced by the majority of older Canadians. In fact, 79% of Canadians agree that older adults (75+) are less important and ignored more often than younger people and 63% of older adults (65+) report that they have been treated either differently or unfairly because of their age. Ageism is dangerous to one's mental and physical health, having been linked to depression, anxiety, coronary heart disease, chronic lung disease, and arthritis. As Canadians continue to live and work longer, the workplace has become an increasingly important space in which older adults can face age-based discrimination. Many older workers are facing ageist behaviours such as having work contributions ignored, being left out of decisions that affect one's work, and being talked down to by co-workers and employers. My doctoral work will investigate the growing disconnect between scholarship that highlights the strategies employers utilize to limit ageism in the workplace and older workers' lived experiences. This will inform my overarching research question: ""how can older workers' (55+) experiences of ageism inform reimagined anti-ageism policies and practices?"" My proposed research will privilege the lived realities of older workers while bringing forward entirely new ways to enact anti-ageism policy and practice. This will, in turn, make the workplace safe for aging employees and contribute to more positive health outcomes."

A consistent theme in this research was that it was in establishing authentic relationships with Aboriginal people that researchers enact ethical best practices in Aboriginal health research. This finding is in keeping with recent advances in Aboriginal research ethics, such as the CIHR Guidelines for Health Research Involving Aboriginal People, that mandate researchers to enter into mutually beneficial partnerships with Aboriginal people to conduct research.  Researchers are advised to be transparent as to their intentions, to invite members of the community to be engaged in all phases of the research as co-researchers, to contribute to the research capacity of community members, and to be faithful to the memorandum of understanding that they have crafted with the Aboriginal community about ownership of the research data. What is unclear is if Aboriginal people perceive the strategies suggested in the guidelines as resulting in authenticity of a researcher's relationship with Aboriginal people in research. It is also not clear how they determine a researcher's authenticity in his/her relationships with Aboriginal people. There is a need to examine in-depth how Aboriginal people experience these guidelines. A critical analysis of how Aboriginal people conceptualize and experience authentic relationships with researchers will contribute to a further explication of this concept, thus providing clarity to researchers and Aboriginal people about how such relationships can be achieved and assessed. The book and presentations that will be created will contain the stories and photographs of Aboriginal people that have been part of the project."
Evaluating the effectiveness of community based holistic health programming in addressing Inuit food security in Arctic Canada: A case study of The Tukisigiarvik Friendship Centre,"['Bunce, Anna K']",['N/A'],"['Climate Change', 'Community Food Programs', 'Community-Based Participatory Research', 'Food Security', 'Inuit', 'Nunavut', 'Social Determinants Of Health']",17500.0,281550,"Food security has been identified by Arctic communities and Northern governments as a significant challenge facing Inuit communities across Arctic Canada. Accessing sufficient nutritious food is a chronic problem for many community members in Iqaluit, Nunavut and a problem which is being exacerbated by environmental and socio-cultural changes. To address this issue the Tukisigiarvik Friendship Centre (TFC) was created in 2003 by Inuit for Inuit. The TFC provides traditional foods to those in need as well as access to counseling, opportunities to learn traditional skills and a chance to go out on the land for those who may not usually be able to. As such, TFC seeks to not only provide food to those in need - and importantly traditional foods - but also seeks to address the broader socio-cultural determinants of food insecurity. This project will serve to evaluate the effectiveness of  the TFC at three levels: the programs ability to ameliorate food insecurity among those unable to obtain sufficient culturally acceptable food in the face of climatic uncertainty; to address the broader socio-cultural determinants of food insecurity; and to transmit land skills and food preparation skills essential for harvesting and consuming traditional foods (i.e. food availability, quality). This evaluative process will determine the extent to which the TFC is helping to address root causes of food insecurity, and provide potential strategies and recommendations for policy makers and community organizations."

Research aimed at addressing these pressing health issues has grown. Sex workers and researchers have identified many ethical challenges in carrying out this research: exclusion of sex worker sub-populations; problematic consent; bias in the methods and topics applied in research; voyeurism; and maintaining privacy and confidentiality. Given that research ethics are critical to the quality of research findings, these challenges raise important questions about real and potential limitations of some of this research to inform policy and health care programming aimed at addressing the grave health inequities experienced by sex workers. To date, there has been minimal research in Canada that has investigated research ethics in relation to research in the field of sex work and health. Most of what we know arises from retrospective discussions about researchers' experiences in undertaking the research. Bioethicists, sex workers, and researchers have identified a pressing need for research that interrogates ethical research conduct and generates evidence to promote greater ethical engagement. Our study proposes to undertake an empirical investigation into the ethical challenges of doing research in this field. We also propose to examine the range of contextual factors (e.g., values and beliefs; knowledge, skill, abilities and attitudes regarding research ethics; research ethics guidelines and policies) that influence the research process. We will conduct interviews with sex workers and researchers and analyze this data in relation to existing ethical policies and guidelines that govern the research process. Findings will be used to develop training resources for sex worker and researcher stakeholders to improve ethical policies and practices for engaging in sex work and health research."

Most research has emphasized individual behaviours of people who work as sex workers and to a lesser extent the economic and social inequities that may increase their risk for HIV. The work environment of the sex industry includes the rules and policies that govern the sex worker and sex buyer relationship, the physical spaces where sex is bought and sold, and the managerial and operational practices that govern the sex worker's activities. Yet, little research in Canada has studied how the work environment may influence  sex workers' vulnerability to HIV infections. And no research has compared the differences in these work environments between men and women who work there, despite the fact that men and women experience vulnerability to HIV infection differently. Our study proposes to examine how the work environment and managerial practices may affect sex workers'  experiences and vulnerability for infection. An analysis of the policies that influence the work environment and the activities of sex workers, sex buyers, managers, and others involved in operating off-street sex venues will provide essential information about how the work environment influences sex worker health. This new knowledge will be used to design targeted interventions to reduce factors in the work environment that affect sex workers' risks for HIV. These interventions will be gender appropriate, thereby increasing their potential for success."

We propose to study STIs among persons living with HIV in Ontario. We will determine how many were tested for STIs, describe those diagnosed with STIs, and report rates of and risk factors for infection. This project will be carried out in collaboration with the Ontario HIV Treatment Network Cohort Study (OCS).

Untreated syphilis is of great concern. It may progress to serious outcomes such as neurosyphilis, in which symptoms such as meningitis or dementia may develop. Moreover, untreated and infectious syphilis can be spread to partners; as well, it can increase the likelihood of further spread of HIV. On the other hand, syphilis testing and treatment of new infections, if detected early, is simple and inexpensive. We aim to enhance syphilis testing among HIV-positive MSM, so that more men will undergo testing, they will test more often, and more cases will be treated early. The intervention will combine syphilis tests with the standard HIV blood tests that are routinely done every 3-6 months for persons in care at 4 hospital-based HIV clinics in Toronto and Ottawa. First, we will describe the proportion tested, how frequently men were tested, and how many new cases were diagnosed during the period prior to the intervention. Next, we will observe rates of testing and new syphilis diagnoses following implementation of the intervention to determine how well it worked. We will draw our observations using data from lab results of syphilis tests, patients' medical charts, and also information obtained from male patients of these clinics who are volunteer participants of an ongoing research study which includes annual interviews. Our results will inform future decisions on whether the intervention should be continued in the participating clinics and also whether it should be introduced to clinics elsewhere. Most importantly, if the intervention proves to ensure more rapid and timely treatment of syphilis, this will prevent serious syphilis-related disease, and, ultimately, may help to control its spread among MSM."

These men are at higher risk for cancers caused by HPV than the general population. HPV vaccine is also recommended for older men, but its cost must be covered by extended health insurance or be paid out of pocket. Based on findings from clinical trials, the vaccine should protect against ongoing infection about 60% of the time in young, healthy men. Research is needed to see if that will be true in real life. We will follow men in Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal to determine how many have ongoing HPV infection, and whether having had HPV vaccine lowers their risk. This will allow us to calculate how well the vaccine works in younger and older men. These findings will help us to evaluate HPV vaccination programs for this high-risk population. They will be shared with public health experts, clinicians, and community members to design better HPV prevention programs, such as vaccination and cancer screening guidelines."

One such group is people living with HIV. HIV affects the immune system's ability to respond to infections and shares some of the same risk factors as COVID-19, such as older age, comorbidities, and lower income. So far, people living with HIV who are taking medications to control their HIV infection seem to get infected with COVID-19 and become hospitalized at similar rates to the general population, but evidence in this area is mixed and more research is needed as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve. Because of limited testing and surveillance gaps, we do not yet know how many people living with HIV have been infected with COVID-19 or whether they will have more severe illness than people who do not have HIV. We will use an existing study of about 4,000 people living with HIV who are receiving care in Ontario to fill these gaps. People living with HIV will be invited to collect a finger prick of blood at home. Blood samples will be tested for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, to see how many people have been infected since the start of the pandemic and whether these antibodies will protect against re-infection. Through linkage to laboratory, hospitalization, and death certificate records, we will find out how many people living with HIV have a lab-confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis or develop more severe illness from COVID-19. We will compare these findings to HIV-negative individuals in Ontario. Through linkage to doctor's visits, we will see how the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted medical care for HIV.

Screening for anal cancer, like we with do for cervical cancer, could save lives and is now recommended in new clinical guidelines. It is time to explore implementation of anal screening in ways that prioritize people living with HIV and GBM who are at the highest risk. Access to prevention should be fair, no matter people's gender identity, sexual orientation, race, or where they live. We will gather evidence in three projects. First, we will estimate how well HPV vaccines work among GBM according to their age, HIV status, and how long they have been sexually active. Second, we will explore equity needs for anal screening implementation by speaking with people living with HIV, healthcare providers, and decision-makers in provincial health systems. Third, we will find out whether new screening tests might do a better job identifying who is at the highest risk for anal cancer, so that they are advanced to the front of the line for full assessment and treatment, if needed. The HPV-EQ Team has much expertise to carry out these projects. It includes frontline leaders and advocates in health services delivery for people living with and at risk of HIV/STBBI.

For many complex diseases, comparing the frequencies of differences in the DNA sequence (called genetic variants) between patients and healthy subjects has identified genes contributing to cause them. However, the individual effects of the genes on disease risk are usually small, and researchers will need to jointly analyze other genes and environmental factors with which they interact to accurately predict individual disease risk. It is also recognized that faulty genetic variants may cause impairments associated to a disease. One way to facilitate the detection of disease genes and better understand their action is to measure various traits relevant to a disease in non-affected relatives of patients. A memory impairment in a relative of a schizophrenic patient, or an allergy in a relative of an asthmatic patient is a hint that the relative shares some but not all of the disease-causing variants with the patient. This proposal aims at developing statistical methods to use these hints of disease in two types of gene finding approaches: linkage analysis, which finds regions of the genome transmitted from the parents to their children together with an observable trait, and association analysis, which finds genetic variants overrepresented in people with a trait. The proposed methods model genetic variants in two genes or one gene and one environmental factor simultaneously, and aim the identification of variants making the difference between having the disease or merely an associated impairment. We will also compare different ways of choosing the family members to determine which ones maximize chances of finding such variants. Finding those variants will provide a better understanding of complex diseases to improve preventive and therapeutic interventions."

Differences between western and traditional Indigenous worldviews of the self-management of T2DM were found, and although studies collected data on sex and/or gender, these terms were often used interchangeably. Also, there was only one study that included 2S people. Phase 1b will be a secondary data analysis of the Regional Health Survey conducted by the First Nations Information Governance Centre in 2015. This secondary data analysis will help us learn how sex and gender influence the self-management practices of Indigenous Peoples living with T2DM in Northern Ontario. We will use a strength-based approach in Phase 1c to explore type 2 diabetes self-management experiences of Indigenous men, women and two-spirited people using storytelling and a gender-based lens. We will collaborate with Indigenous artists to make patient journey maps to visualize the lived experiences of Indigenous People living with T2DM.

The purpose of this study is to conduct an epidemiological study of individuals with Type 2 diabetes to describe (a) the prevalence of strong and weak habits for self-management behaviours, (b) how habits develop and change over time, and (c) associations between habits and physical and mental health. This project is embedded in the Evaluation of Diabetes Treatment (EDIT) study, which is an ongoing longitudinal study of individuals with Type 2 diabetes. Data are collected annually. Habit strength for self-management behaviours will be measured and described during waves 4 through 6 of EDIT. Associations between habit strength and physical and mental health outcomes will be assessed. Individuals who have changed regimens (e.g. began insulin therapy) will be examined separately to explore how new habits develop and change. This study is the first to develop a comprehensive understanding of habits for self-management behaviours among people with Type 2 diabetes and the first population-level study of habits for self-management of a chronic condition. Behaviour change is a central aspect of diabetes management, so results are relevant for intervention development."
"Examining psychosocial, behavioural and biological factors related to mental health and diabetes","['Burns, Rachel J']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],76.0,400021,"Approximately 10% Canadian adults have been diagnosed with diabetes and approximately 20% of Canadian adults experience a mental health problem annually. Moreover, mental health problems, particularly elevated depressive symptoms, and diabetes often co-occur; individuals with diabetes are approximately twice as likely to have elevated depressive symptoms compared to the general population.

My research explores the complex associations between mental health and diabetes by considering psychosocial, behavioural, and biological factors. For example, my work has examined if coping strategies predict mental health outcomes in adults with diabetes and has demonstrated the cyclical associations between depressive symptoms and social support in adults with diabetes. Some of my other work has examined the role of biological factors in the context of diabetes and mental health.

One of my current research projects examines if patterns of depressive symptoms predict the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes. Another series of projects that I am working on examines spousal influences in the context of diabetes. For example, I am examining if spousal depressive symptoms are associated with glycemic control and physical activity among adults with diabetes. I have also recently received funding to examine associations between positive mental health (e.g., satisfaction with life, purpose in life) and physical activity in adults with diabetes."
"Associations of Ethnicity, Social, and Behavioural Factors with Cancer Incidence and Mortality in BC Regions","['Burrus, Kimberly J']",['N/A'],"['Behavioural Predictors', 'Cancer', 'Cancer Disparties', 'Determinants Of Health', 'Economic Factors', 'Ethnicity And Immigration', 'Health Promotion', 'Health Status', 'Multiple Regression Analysis', 'Social Predictors']",17500.0,280819,"Cancer differentially affects populations and geographical regions. People with lower socioeconomic status (SES), from certain ethnic groups and areas are more likely to have poor health and a higher risk of cancer. A group at particular risk is immigrants in British Columbia (BC), partly due to ethnicity and unhealthy lifestyle factors adopted in Canada, such as tobacco use, poor nutrition, obesity and physical inactivity. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors that contribute to the disparity in cancer incidence and mortality in a sample of British Columbians, specifically socioeconomic indicators (income and human economic hardship), geographical region and lifestyle factors (diet, obesity, physical activity and tobacco use). We will also examine whether differential outcomes are related to ethnic subgroups and immigrants. Analyses will be conducted using a data set of adult cancers diagnosed over a five-year period that was collected by the BC Cancer Registry, and includes follow-up for death. Data on immigration in BC will be obtained from Citizenship and Immigration Canada and linked to the Cancer Registry data. Data on the socio economic profiles and ethnicity of specific regions in BC will be obtained through BC Stats. Correlations and multiple regression analyses will be used to examine the associations between socioeconomic factors, ethnicity, place of birth, and cancer survival for common cancers, controlling for age and sex. Health related behaviours and geographic variation by region will be examined using the BC Wellness Atlas. Understanding more about the particular risk factors for vulnerable ethnic groups, immigrants and communities is important to develop targeted prevention programs and improve the health of the BC population. Recommendations will be made regarding health promotion strategies for modifying cancer-related health behaviours, and suggestions to improve social determinants of health in disadvantaged groups in BC."
Advancing Preventive Care for Healthy Aging,"['Burton, Lindsay']",['N/A'],"['Older Adults', 'Preventive Care']",1139.0,476449,"The purpose of this study is to explore influences and differences in preventive care use across the older adult age spectrum. With the expected two-to-six-fold growth of Canadians 75 and older and tripling of the proportion of individuals 85 years and older over the next 30 years, promoting healthy aging is all the more critical. Preventive care refers to screening (e.g., mammography) and immunization (e.g., flu shot) services offered to the general population based on age, sex, and risk factors for disease. The purpose of preventive care services is to reduce morbidity, increase early disease detection, and reduce chronic disease prevalence. The goal of meeting preventive care use targets is ultimately to maximize quality of life. Older adults have, on average more preventive service recommendations than younger adults, yet have low use of services. Numerous barriers to accessing preventive services, such as ageism, awareness, or availability, may be key contributors to low use of services. To date, no Canadian studies have explored the impacts of these barriers across the older adult age continuum. Interventions are needed to address these gaps in older adult preventive care. While generic preventive care interventions have made marginal improvements in service uptake, they have not reached targets for completion. This study will address these gaps in knowledge using a combination of surveys and focus groups. Data collected will capture barriers and facilitators of preventive care use. Exploring nuances and influences across the older adult spectrum will produce valuable knowledge for designing and implementing interventions to improve older adult preventive care."
"""Lots Of Data, Little Information"": Beyond Environmental Assessment And Towards The Next Generation Of Integrative Cumulative Impact Assessment","['Buse, Christopher G']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal Health', 'Cumulative Health Impacts', 'Environmental Influences On Health', 'Health Equity', 'Population Health', 'Rural And Remote Communities']",2800.0,352499,"Resource development is a driver of local and international economies and has resulted in extraordinary advances for modern society. As the global thirst for lumber, minerals and energy grows, an increasing amount of stress is placed on the land and its ability to sustain life. With multiple industries now operating adjacent to one another, the cumulative impacts of diverse land-use has become a significant area of scientific inquiry, and it is increasingly recognized that project-based environmental assessment (EA) is limited in its ability to capture the impacts of multiple land-uses. Moreover, significant data is produced in EA processes, but community stakeholders have voiced concerns that there is little digestable `information' that adequately accounts for community perspectives of cumulative impacts and regional changes to environments and communities. This research reports on the state of the art of cumulative impact assessment in relation to policy developments in British Columbia, Canada, with a specific focus on Aboriginal efforts to more holistically appraise the cumulative impacts of resource development. The paper goes on to discuss a new research tool developed by the Cumulative Impacts Research Consortium in collaboration with rural, remote and Aboriginal communities with long and storied histories of resource development. The tool is explicitly designed to address shortcomings in the environmental assessment process; to improve third-party monitoring initiatives at the regional level by integrating environmental, community and health data into a historical understanding of cumulative impacts, while bolstering capacity for independent analysis of the impacts of resource development without creating an additional data collection burden for communities. Implications for utilizing data across scales and enhancing population and Aboriginal health and its determinants as related to resource development are discussed."

Despite being an identified pillar of environmental assessment (EA) regulation in British Columbia, health is typically analyzed through the lens of biophysical exposure risks and direct health impacts as part of a 'desktop review' of baseline data. Indeed, the limited inclusion of the determinants of health in EA processes has been documented provincially, nationally and internationally due to limitations of capacity and expertise, poor intersectional and disciplinary collaboration, and the need for transparency and efficiency in assessment.  This project takes a ""health in all policies"" approach to consider how the social and ecological determinants of health can be better accounted for in EA processes to promote upstream drivers of health and well-being. Through a combination of policy analysis, surveys, interviews and capacity-building workshops with diverse sectors involved in EA certification (e.g. First Nations Lands officers, industry proponents, EA practitioners, health authority staff, and a variety of other provincial ministerial contacts), this research seeks to promote a new generation of intersectoral engagement in resource governance processes. Specifically, it leverages lessons from across sectors to enhance collaboration during EA certification, bolster monitoring and surveillance of the determinants of health in the EA process, and thereby improve capacity of the many actors examining and responding to population health and health equity impacts of resource development."

Documented impacts include staff burnout, experiences of trauma, and moral injury caused by a health system driven beyond its capacity in the face of large-scale emergency events that lead to elevated morbidity and mortality. Moreover, climate-related impacts are differentially experienced by rural and remote health practitioners that have limited staff and resources, but larger geographic jurisdictions relative to urban health regions. This project aims to bolster the mental health resilience of rural and remote health system emergency planners and responders by completing: [1] an environmental scan of mental health promoting resources, supports and training materials drawn from an international sample of peer countries; [2] organization-wide surveys; and [3] trauma-informed focus groups and in-depth interviews with staff from two rural health regions in British Columbia (Interior Health and Northern Health). By highlighting organizational and occupational determinants of mental health, this project aims to elucidate leading practices in creating a 'culture of care' for health systems practitioners by identifying opportunities for reducing barriers to mental health promotion, and enhancing opportunities for action. Findings will be shared through publications, presentations, and the creation of a handbook on mental health promotion for knowledge users based on study results. Extending the reach of findings beyond the health sector will achieved through two place-based knowledge-to-action workshops held in Prince George and Kelowna, and one on-line event hosted in Vancouver but broadcast across the province."
Health care professionals perspectives on improving cancer screening for newcomers in New Brunswick.,"['Busolo, David S']",['N/A'],"['Cancer Prevention', 'Health Care Professionals', 'Newcomers']",940.0,400392,"In Canada and New Brunswick, cancer is the main cause of death. In 2013, about 4,800 people got cancer in New Brunswick, and close to 1,930 people died of the disease. The number of newcomers in Canada and New Brunswick is on the rise. As such, the number of adults from this group that can get cancer is likely to go up. This increase is likely to continue unless steps are taken to improve how newcomers to the province check for cancer. Cancer screening programs need to address the struggles that new people to the province face in their desire to be checked. Prior to making such changes, it is key to find out how health care professionals provide cancer screening to newcomers. As such, this study has three aims:
1.Examine health care professionals experiences of providing cancer screening services to newcomers in New Brunswick. 
2.Find out what health care professionals think about the challenges that newcomers experience in their quest to be checked for cancer.  
3.Ask the health care professionals to suggest ways to improve cancer screening for newcomers. 
Health care professionals (physicians, nurse practitioners) who practice in New Brunswick will be invited to take part. Thirty health care professionals will be approached to include diverse participants for an in-depth study. Participants will complete a demographic profile and take part in individual interviews. Field notes will be written after every interview. Participants' demographic profile will be checked for identifiers (such as their average age). The interviews will be transcribed, coded, and themes will be identified. Action will be taken to look for relationships between the themes and the identifiers. We will observe ethical rules throughout the study. After getting the results, a number of knowledge translation and exchange activities will ensue. This study is innovative as it will be the first of its kind to be conducted in New Brunswick and the first step for future work in this area."
The Effect of Air Pollution in Developing Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus,"['Butalia, Sonia', 'Rabi, Doreen M']","['Johnson, Jeffrey A', 'Kaplan, Gilaad G', 'Villeneuve, Paul J']","['Air Pollution', 'Epidemiology', 'Risk Factor', 'Type 1 Diabetes']",112317.0,293454,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus (or type 1 diabetes) is a condition that results from the autoimmune destruction of insulin producing cells of the pancreas. Type 1 diabetes is sometimes referred to as juvenile diabetes as the majority of this condition's onset is during childhood and adolescence.  Type 1 diabetes is treated with lifelong multiple daily insulin injections, as it does not have a cure, and at this point we do not know how to prevent this condition.  

There are only a few known risk factors for type 1 diabetes.  For example, having a family member with the condition is a risk factor. However, many researchers believe something in the environment may be triggering people to develop type 1 diabetes. Unfortunately, we do not know what in the environment may be doing this but some preliminary research supports that outdoor air pollution could be a factor.

We plan to study if there is an association between outdoor air pollution and developing type 1 diabetes.  We plan to follow a large group of people without diabetes and see if those who develop type 1 diabetes are more likely to live in areas with higher levels of outdoor air pollution.  

This study is important because if a link is found between higher levels of outdoor air pollution and increased chance of developing type 1 diabetes, it may encourage policy makers to reduce outdoor air pollution, and lead to cleaner air for everyone. This potentially may also reduce the chance of developing type 1 diabetes."

With knowledge of these health inequities, solutions may be put in place to improve the health of Canadians. Reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection is important so public health measures are key, especially COVID-19 vaccination. Some groups of people, such as people with diabetes, are at risk of health inequities, and this may have occurred with COVID-19 vaccination.

Over 3.9 million Canadians have diabetes. People with diabetes are ~ 3 times more likely to be hospitalized, need an intensive care unit, or die from COVID-19 compared to people without diabetes. Unfortunately, little is known about how many people with diabetes have received the COVID-19 vaccine compared to those without diabetes, and if any characteristics of people with diabetes (e.g., their age, sex, or what medications they use) are related to receiving the vaccine.

This study has two aims: (1) To learn about the rates of COVID-19 vaccination among people with and without diabetes: and (2) To learn if there are any characteristics of people with diabetes that are associated with receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. 

We will link several large databases within Alberta to assess the rates of COVID-19 vaccination among people with and without diabetes. Then, we will describe the characteristics of people with diabetes, including children, who have received COVID-19 vaccination.

This study is important because it will provide important information on COVID-19 vaccination rates in people with diabetes, and characteristics of people that have lower or higher vaccination rates.  We are working closely with key organizations (This is Our Shot, 19 to Zero, the Vaccine Hesitancy Guide, and Diabetes Canada) so that the information we learn is shared with people with diabetes, the public, health care professionals, and government representatives to keep people with diabetes healthy and safe."
The Acute Effects of Ambient Air Pollution in Susceptible Populations,"['Buteau, Stéphane']",['N/A'],"['Acute Effects', 'Air Pollution', 'Cohort', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Public Health', 'Suceptible Population']",105000.0,307745,"Short-term elevations in ambient air pollution have been found to be associated with increased risks of numerous adverse health effects, including hospitalization and death for cardiovascular causes. It has been postulated that air pollution poses an acute threat principally to persons in poor health. This study focus on persons with health conditions who from previous studies have been shown to be at higher risk for air pollution-mediated effects: congestive heart failure; chronic coronary artery disease; and diabetes.
The main objectives of my research are: 1) to determine in these susceptible populations whether short-term changes in air pollution are associated with the incidence of death, hospitalizations and emergency department visits and; 2) to assess whether these associations are modified according indicators of change of health status (e.g. changes in medication). Using health data from men and women who were residents of Montreal and who were age 65 years and above during 1991-2002, I will conduct a series of analyses to estimate associations between the selected health outcomes and the daily ambient levels of air pollution. 
The design to be used is unique in that it allows to overcome limitations of other study designs by taking into consideration subject-specific information and previous medical histories throughout the period of follow-up. This study will further our understanding as to whether short-term exposures to ambient air pollution is associated with changes in health status likely leading to critical health events (such as death) among susceptible populations. These results are essential information to toxicologists to refine their models in better understanding the relative importance of the proposed mechanisms in real-world environment settings. In term of public health, these findings will be useful to regulatory agencies worldwide in defining permissible levels of ambient air pollution to better protect the susceptible populations"
Pediatric cancers and prenatal exposure to air pollution : A population-based birth cohort study in Canada,"['Buteau, Stéphane']","['Auger, Nathalie', 'Ho, Vikki', 'Lavigne, Éric', 'Smargiassi, Audrey']","['Air Pollution', 'Cohort', 'Pediatric Cancer']",244799.0,489248,"The etiology of pediatric cancer is poorly understood. This is an important knowledge gap because pediatric cancer is the second leading cause of death among Canadian children and responsible for 11.5 million years of life lost worldwide each year. A better understanding of modifiable risk factors is necessary to address the public health burden of childhood cancer. 
Air pollution may play a role in childhood cancer and initiate the pathogenesis in utero. However, epidemiological evidence remains scarce. Very few studies have used a cohort design and statistical power has been limited due to rarity of the disease. Studies have mostly focused on traffic pollution in urban settings, and relied on suboptimal exposure assessment methods. In addition, air pollution from industries and gasoline stations is understudied even though these sources emit known carcinogens. This proposal builds on unique and refined air pollution exposure data and population-based birth cohorts from the two largest Canadian provinces (Ontario and Quebec). We will conduct statistical analyses to determine whether the risk of pediatric cancer is associated with prenatal exposure to (i) ambient air pollutants, (ii) industrial emissions and, (iii) residential proximity to gasoline stations. For ambient pollutants, we will also investigate if there are critical windows of exposure during pregnancy when the fetus is at greater risk of the adverse effects of air pollution. Our multidisciplinary team include experts in pediatrics, cancer and environmental epidemiology, public health, exposure modeling and biostatistics who have the knowledge and expertise to successfully carry out the work. Our research will contribute novel insights about the role of air pollution in pediatric cancer. Findings will serve public health professionals and regulatory authorities in Canada who lack evidence on which to base recommendations for acceptable levels of air pollution to adequately protect children's health."

Prison-based therapeutic communities (TCs) offer an alternative to traditional, punitive responses to crime and substance use. TCs are small cohesive communities that provide an environment for belonging, relationship-building, agency, self-development, and personal responsibility. There has been little effort to test TCs in Canada despite repeated and urgent calls for improvements to correctional services. Moreover, there is limited high-quality research to evaluate the efficacy of TCs and inform TC development and implementation in Canada, particularly in prisons. In this mixed-methods project, we will conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the Guthrie Therapeutic Community (GTC), based at the Nanaimo Correctional Centre. To estimate the impact of the GTC on health and criminal justice outcomes, we will use newly available linked administrative data via the Data Innovation Program and compare GTC residents with a matched sample of clients from a traditional correctional centre. To investigate what contributes to positive versus negative outcomes, a survey will be administered to a group of GTC residents while they are in the program, and twice more post-release (at 1 and 6 months). We will explore the perspectives of GTC clients and staff via in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Finally, we will employ a narrative, Indigenous led story-telling approach to better understand how to integrate Indigenous knowledge and create a culturally affirming and safe space for Indigenous clients. The knowledge gained from this study will inform the implementation of TCs in other facilities and jurisdictions in Canada. Findings could also be applied to post-release supports to enhance the quality and availability of aftercare, reducing drug toxicity death and other substance-related harms."

The presence of multiple infections together (HCV, HBV and/or HIV) could be associated with more illness and deaths; however, information on impact of multiple infections is limited. We evaluated the effect of HCV, HBV and HIV infections on deaths from all causes in British Columbia, Canada. We analyzed the British Columbia Hepatitis Testers Cohort which includes approximately 1.7 million individuals tested for HCV or HIV, or reported as a case of HCV, HIV, or HBV from 1990 to 2015, and linked to administrative healthcare databases. We calculated death rates for people with HCV, HBV or HIV single, double, and triple infections. Using a statistical method (Cox proportional hazards regression), we analyzed factors associated with deaths from all causes among people tested for HCV, HBV and HIV infections.
Out of 659,541 individuals that were tested, there were 34,641 (5.25%) deaths. The highest all-cause death rate was noted in individuals with HCV/HBV/HIV triple infection followed by HCV/HIV, HCV/HBV, and HBV/HIV double infections, and HCV, HIV and HBV single infections. Individuals with HCV/HBV/HIV triple infection had highest risk of death followed by HCV/HIV, HCV/HBV, HBV/HIV double infections, and HCV, HIV, and HBV single infections. Other factors associated with higher all-cause deaths included being male, comorbidities, problematic alcohol use, material deprivation, tuberculosis, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, heart failure and hypertension.
Presence of multiple infections are associated with higher number of deaths with risk of dying highest among those with triple infections. Problematic alcohol use, comorbidities and material disadvantage were significantly associated with deaths from all causes. Interventions aimed at prevention and treatment of multiple infections and other comorbidities could significantly reduce deaths."

PCS is a relatively new health issue, with cases currently identified using definitions that consider the signs and symptoms typically reported by COVID-19-recovered individuals. Current research on PCS, including PCS definitions, has come from high-income countries (HICs). However, due to differences in socioeconomic conditions and disease profiles, what we know about PCS in HICs is not fully applicable to low and middle-income countries (LMICs). This research will study and understand PCS in a LMIC: Bangladesh. We will identify the long-term symptoms and health complications in COVID-19-recovered patients in Bangladesh, and study how other health conditions and socioeconomic factors such as occupation affect whether PCS occurs and how long it lasts. We will examine health as well as economic impacts such as livelihood disruption in individuals who have PCS. Our study will include all COVID-19-tested (COVID-19 positive and negative) individuals in a sub-district of Bangladesh, identified through a globally recognized demographic and health surveillance system. For these individuals, we will identify those with symptoms of PCS and establish a disease profile of the study population. We will then follow all individuals, both with and without PCS, to understand how PCS complications change over time and whether people without PCS later develop it. Advanced statistical techniques will be used to estimate how common PCS is, and determine how PCS appears (e.g., common symptoms), how severe it is, and how long it lasts for individuals who have it. The results will help with the early management of PCS in LMICs and reduce long term impact of the pandemic. It will establish Canadian research partnerships for improved global health emergency response and build Canadian expertise in preparedness and response research."

Use of methamphetamine has been rapidly increasing globally. Availability and use of methamphetamine has increased in Canada, particularly in British Columbia (BC) where self-reported methamphetamine use tripled among harm reduction site clients between 2012 and 2018, and the presence of methamphetamine among illicit drug-related deaths increased almost 10 times between 2012 and 2017. Methamphetamine use is associated with a range of health and social harms including serious mental health conditions such as psychosis, brain damage, heart disease, and increased risk of disease transmission through higher-risk sexual behaviour and unsafe injection practices. Many people who use drugs use both methamphetamine and opioids which can be particularly risky, increasing the chance of overdose death, and non-fatal overdose and its long-term consequences.
The nature of the rise in methamphetamine use in Canada is poorly understood. Through this BC wide study, we seek to: 1) describe the characteristics of increased methamphetamine use; 2) explore factors related to use of methamphetamine, including how people use the drug and if by itself or in combination with other drugs; and 3) better understand the reasons for use of methamphetamine. We will also look at how these factors differ across the province. 
To answer our questions, we will interview about 60 people who use drugs from around BC. The focus will be on methamphetamine use and co-use with other drugs such as opioids. An annual survey administered to about 1000 people at harm reduction sites across BC will ask about recent substances used including route and order of use; reported substances used will be confirmed by urine testing. Understanding factors that drive increasing methamphetamine use and its use with other drugs are essential to guide effective harm reduction efforts."
Canadian Aboriginal AIDS Network's Research and Policy Unit: A Critical Appraisal of a History of Involvement,"['Byce, Lauren']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1250.0,368330,"Background: In 2017, working with researchers from McMaster University, the Canadian Aboriginal AIDS Network (CAAN) led a comprehensive review of their research history. The key question was: Where have we've been and where are we going? This work was inspired by the desire to better use CAAN's evidence base to improve our research focus, our research practice, and to guide future research projects and programs.

Methods: Using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP), we charted all CAAN's research. The chart captured key research using the following headings: (1) methodology; (2) method; (3) analytic procedures; (4) knowledge transfer, translation, and mobilization; and (5) key findings. Participatory analysis focused on gaps in our research, trends focused on and evolving research approach, and a summary of key research findings/recommendations that might inform public policy and program development.

Results: Three thematic areas emerged from our analysis, including: (1) An evolving research focus (e.g., From catalyst grants and operating grants in the CBR funding stream to applying to open operating and centre grant research competitions, etc.); (2) Trends associated with CAAN's research approach (e.g., Using solely Western approaches and methods to more use of decolonizing and Indigenous methodologies, etc.); and (3) A thematic summary of research findings (e.g., from a focus on the pathologies of risk and living HIV experience, to recognizing colonization as a driving force that shapes experiences to HIV, to recognizing that culture and cultural reclamation provide an effective mediating response from a strengthen-based perspective, etc.).

Conclusion: Several gaps in the focus of CAAN research were noted (e.g., transgender, intervention and program science research). As well, we continue to work to further develop our use of Indigenous methodologies (e.g., analytic approaches to understanding data from within an Indigenous world view)."
Barriers to and Facilitators of the Implementation of a National Sexual and Reproductive Health Education Curriculum in the Schools of India,"['Byers, Elaine S', 'Bhattacharya, Madhulekha']","['Jana, Smarajit', 'Basu, Salil K', 'Ladhani, Sulaiman S', 'Merchant, Malik M', 'Mitra, Koumari', ""O'Sullivan, Lucia F""]","['Adolescents', 'Families', 'India', 'Population Health', 'Sexual And Reproductive Health', 'Sexual Health Education']",,204717,"India has one of the world's poorest sexual/reproductive health records among adolescents. Sexual health education is a fundamental platform upon which healthy sexual practices can be adopted. Schools provide a structured context for relaying sexual health information. The Central Government in India is trying to implement an innovative and comprehensive national sex education program (the AEP) to counter this abysmal adolescent health record. Unfortunately, one-quarter of state governments are actively resisting implementation of the AEP; others are implementing versions that omit critical issues (e.g., sexual intercourse). Opponents argue that efforts to implement the AEP have ""devalued Indian culture and values."" Yet, other key initiatives that Central Government wants to implement that will improve adolescents' quality of life are directly dependent on youth's acquisition of this important sexual information. A means to resolve this debate is urgently needed because the two positions are becoming increasingly polarized, making the possibility of effective policy development and meaningful delivery of sexual health education ever more remote. There are no data to inform this debate. Understanding the individual, sociocultural, and political factors that interfere with or facilitate the adoption and implementation of the AEP is essential. We propose to address this challenge by assessing key attitudes and experiences among three stakeholder groups (i.e., state government officials, school administrators, and teachers), who together are responsible for adoption and implementation of the curriculum. There are three central research questions: What factors prevent or facilitate AEP adoption?  To what extent are schools offering sexual health education and the AEP in particular? How do individual and sociocultural factors (including gender) affect administrators' and teachers' attitudes toward, perceptions of, and experiences with sexual health education?"

However, effective social media is not just about adopting these tools, but about adapting them to ensure that messages are received by the people who need them most. The overarching aim of this proposal is to build social media capacity in British Columbia to strengthen communications during public health emergencies. We aim to: 1) develop and deliver a series of workshops that address social media training needs identified by public health communicators; 2) bring together a group of public health communicators and stakeholders within the province to identify remaining knowledge gaps that are necessary to strengthen capacity; and 3) build a provincial communications Community of Practice that integrates the skills and resources of member organizations. Together, these aims will provide a set of tools to improve current and future social media communications during public health emergencies."

Through universal health coverage in Canada, claims data can track all medical procedures, tests and diagnoses by residents. Together with claims processed through provincial drug benefits, these data sources permit the study of how drugs are used, as well as drug effects. We outline two pilot projects that capitalize on claims data from Ontario to examine osteoporosis pharmacotherapy. 

First, valid estimates of the safety and effectiveness of therapeutics are required to help inform drug policy decision making. Unfortunately, results from claims-based observational studies may be biased due to incomplete information. We will use innovative methods that supplement claims data with other data sources to examine the potential benefits of these analytic strategies in improving estimates of the effectiveness of osteoporosis drugs among seniors.

Second, we know that adherence to therapy for osteoporosis is suboptimal. However, little information is available regarding the patterns of drug use or the implications of gaps in adherence to osteoporosis pharmacotherapy. We will study patterns of pharmacotherapy, predictors of large gaps in treatment and implications of gaps in adherence. Results will help identify the burden of osteoporosis in the population related to suboptimal adherence, and may be used to help develop quality improvement interventions. 

Results from these pilot projects will help inform future innovative projects that aim to reduce the burden of illness in the population due to adverse drug effects and failure to adhere to preventive pharmacotherapy. Results will be important to guide health policy, develop quality improvement interventions, reduce health care costs, and ultimately reduce the burden of illness in the population due to adverse drug effects and suboptimal adherence to chronic pharmacotherapy."

In a previous study, Caregiving Parents of Children with Life-Limiting Illnesses, we developed and tested a model that helps us understand the factors that contribute to personal growth and stress in caregivers of these children; the purpose of the proposed study is to further develop this model. This extended study will allow us to learn more from the parents caring for very sick children as they share their changing experiences over time and also from a second group of parents: those who are bereaved.  As a result, we will be able to investigate the differences in the stress, personal resources, and growth between both parent caregivers and bereaved parents. This is a unique opportunity to study the positive and negative aspects of caregiving and bereavement over time.  

New knowledge obtained from this study will be of tremendous value to parents, practitioners and policy makers concerned with childhood life-limiting illness. Pathways leading to positive outcomes will be identified through this study and will then be used to optimize the emotional, social, and spiritual care available to patients and families receiving paediatric palliative services, including bereavement care."

In Canada, there are no accurate statistics about the number of people grieving; however 260,000 people die each year (Statistics Canada, 2018). With a conservative estimate of an average of four people
being bereaved for each one of those deaths (Albrecht, Comartin, Valeriote, Block & Scarpaleggia, 2011), this means one million Canadians are grieving each year, from death due to disease, accidents, and suicide. Despite the inevitability, grief remains a stigmatized and relatively hidden issue. Neither research nor practice has adequately grappled with how our services and our society can truly help.

Moreover, mental illness tends to strike people in early adulthood at a time when many Canadians are planning on furthering their education, entering the workforce or beginning to have children. Even though there are numerous, effective treatments for most of the major mental disorders that affect Canadians, existing research suggests that fewer than 50% of individuals with mental disorders seek help from physicians or mental health specialists like psychiatrists. This has been referred to as 'unmet need'. However, estimates of unmet need, like the one above, and the factors responsible for it, are not well understood because virtually all data available are based on self-reports. The problem with relying on self-reported use of services is that they are influenced by things like recall (memory) and stigma - many people do not want to admit they went to a physician for mental health. Recently, Canada's first national survey of mental disorders - the Canadian Community Health Survey 1.2 - was linked to health administration data in Ontario, allowing us to explore the association between mental disorder and service use in a way that does not depend on self-reported use, but actual medical records. This project includes a series of studies that take advantage of the opportunity created by this linked data to explore unmet need."

In Canada, about 1 to 2 children in every classroom has DCD. Parents and teachers tell us these kids have problems learning to do everyday motor activities like tying shoelaces, playing ball and climbing stairs. Some research has shown that these kids are more likely to be overweight and unfit by the time they are teenagers. We believe this is because they struggle with sports and play and, since they know they are not good at it, they choose not to do it. The problem is that the right research study has not been done yet so we do not know if this is the case or if there are reasons why they have these problems. Other research studies have looked at older children who already had trouble doing motor activities or who were already overweight and unfit. To understand how to help kids with DCD, we need to begin when they are young and still learning how to be active and play with their friends. In our study, we will test the motor skills of 2100 children ages 4 and 5 because we are not sure that we can identify kids with DCD until age 4. We expect to identify 300 children who have DCD according to medical criteria and we will randomly pick another 300 who are developing typically and who do not have motor problems. These children will then be seen every 9 months for a total of 5 visits. During these visits, we will examine their motor coordination, how much physical activity they do, how fit they are, their diet and how much they weigh. What makes our study new and exciting is that we will study how all these things relate to each other and how they change over time. Understanding these relationships, and working with knowledge users who can put the implications of these into practice, will help us make sure that kids with DCD are able to get the right type of support, at the right time, so they don't become unfit or obese."

Nova Scotia developed a Physical Activity Framework to help schools be more active places through better environments, more opportunities for play and active lessons. The Framework will start to make schools more active places to be in Fall 2021. This is a new long-term program and we want to measure its success. The goal of this research project is to measure how the Physical Activity Framework is being used in schools across Nova Scotia. We will measure if students' physical activity levels and wellness change after being in schools that put the Framework into action.  We will also ask students and teachers about how their schools are becoming more active places, like adding new playgrounds or more active lessons. We will keep track of the changes for 2 years.

As a result, countries worldwide have implemented minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) legislation that seeks to reduce alcohol-related harm among youths by imposing age restrictions on the purchasing, possession, and consumption of alcohol. The MLDA is 18 years of age in Alberta, Manitoba, Québec, and 19 years of age in the rest of Canada. Recently, a renewed debate has occurred in Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and United States about drinking-age laws. In the spring/summer of 2013 in Canada, national and provincial alcohol-policy coalitions have recommended raising the MLDA, while some provincial political parties have tabled proposals to lower the MLDA. At this time, Canada lacks comprehensive and up-to-date scientific evidence about the effectiveness of its MLDA legislation. The current study aims to investigate whether the MLDA has an influence on key health and social outcomes and, if so, to estimate the size of its effects. In particular, our study will assess the impacts, if any, of the MLDA on: (1) fatal/non-fatal motor vehicle collisions (MVCs); (2) Emergency Department (ED) admissions for alcohol-use disorders and injuries; and (3) criminal behaviour among youth. Study results might show that the MLDA does or does not have an effect on our chosen health and crime outcomes. Regardless of the direction of our findings, our study will provide important scientific data for informing the current MLDA debate in Canada."

Both Hawaii and California implemented statewide legislation in 2016 to raise the minimum tobacco purchasing age to 21 years. Currently, MATS laws are 18 years of age in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Québec, the Yukon and Northwest Territories, and 19 years of age in the rest of the country. It is expected that a higher minimum-age policy would significantly reduce the number of teenagers and young adults starting to smoke and, as a result, decrease both immediate and long-term smoking-related harms in society, such as tobacco-related illnesses, cancers, and deaths. Research on MATS laws in Canada is lacking, and it is critically important to evaluate the potential impacts of such Canadian policy recommendations, especially given that approximately 18% of Canadians are current smokers. The proposed project will assess the impacts of Canada's current MATS laws on youth smoking behaviour, and it will consider the possibility that MATS laws will affect males and females differently. Given the lack of research on MATS laws, especially in Canada, the study results are likely to advance health policy development and implementation in Canada and abroad.

The Canadian Pediatric Society and the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police have expressed concern about how cannabis legalization might exacerbate patterns of motor vehicle collisions (MVCs) among young people. Cannabis-impaired driving is now more prevalent among adolescents than alcohol-impaired driving, and individuals aged 15-24 years have the highest annual numbers of national emergency department admissions for MVC injuries.

One of the three central goals of the Cannabis Act aims to prevent cannabis use and related harms among youth. The Cannabis Act imposes a federal minimum-age restriction for the sale of cannabis products to individuals at least 18 years of age, with provinces having the mandate to set increased age limits. At this time, the MLCAs are 18 years in Alberta and Québec, and 19 years in the rest of the country. The Principal Investigator's prior research has shown that Canadian minimum-age restrictions do work. For example, in comparison to young people slightly younger than minimum legal drinking age (MLDA) restrictions, those young people just older than the MLDA have significant and immediate increases in MVC injury presentations to inpatient hospitals/emergency departments, police-reported alcohol-impaired driving crimes, and alcohol-related MVCs. 

The project aims to assess the impacts of cannabis legalization on patterns of MVC injuries among youth (defined as individuals still under MLCA restrictions) and young adults (those just older than the cannabis age-based limits) presenting to emergency departments across Canada. It is expected that the implementation of the Cannabis Act will be associated with: (1) significant increases in patterns of injury due to MVCs among young adults just older than the provincial/territorial MLCAs; and (2) no evidence of change in MVC injuries among age-restricted youth."

Background and Importance. On October 17, 2018, the Canadian Federal government implemented the Cannabis Act-the framework for cannabis legalization in Canada. This legislation requires a comprehensive assessment of the Cannabis Act's effects on the health of Canadian youth. The proposed studies support the evaluation of the Cannabis Act.

Research Aims. The current proposal examines two critically important national and international public health concerns related to youth and cannabis legalization: (STUDY 1) police-reported youth cannabis-related criminal offenses; and (STUDY 2) the effectiveness of minimum legal cannabis sales age (MLCSA) laws-a key legislative component of legalization designed to protect underage youth from cannabis-related harms.

Methods. The proposed project will undertake two studies, each using a different set of data. STUDY 1 will use national police-reported crime data. STUDY 2 will work with emergency department data from Ontario and Alberta, as well as with national inpatient hospital admission data. Statistical analyses will evaluate how aspects of the cannabis legalization process might be associated with possible cannabis-related harms or benefits to youth.

Study Team. The study team has the experience and demonstrated expertise to complete the studies and make the scientific findings widely available to other scientists, policymakers, and the general public.

Expected Outcomes and Significance. The project supports the evaluation of the Cannabis Act, and it will help to determine the potential harms and benefits of cannabis legalization and its overall impact on Canadian youth."

These relationship dynamics occur in a social context where disclosure of HIV-serodiscordant status may prove challenging given HIV-related stigma. The lack of Canadian research on these issues presents a clear opportunity to expand scientific understanding of relationship dynamics within SDCs, to improve supportive services, and promote the wellbeing of these Canadian couples. To this end, we are proposing a national, cross sectional, mixed-methods study that aims to examine the links between relationship satisfaction and management of transmission risk among SDCs in Canada. SDCs will be recruited to a quantitative survey and/or qualitative interview that will gather evidence on: (1) sociodemographic and relationship characteristics of SDCs across Canada; (2) individual (e.g., age, sex, gender), dyadic (e.g., type and duration) and social (e.g., social support, satisfaction with services, stigma) determinants of relationship satisfaction; (3) associations between management of HIV risk and relationship satisfaction; (4) perceived needs and access to supportive services and (5) subjective experiences of the risks and benefits of involvement in an HIV-serodiscordant relationship.

Immediate ART initiation after HIV diagnosis has also been shown to be highly effective at reducing HIV transmission risk within heterosexual HIV-serodiscordant couples; however, equivalent evidence for men who have sex with men (MSM) has been limited to a few observational studies in high-income settings. Although immediate treatment after HIV diagnosis (i.e., treatment as prevention), regardless of CD4 count, is now considered best practice for key populations including MSM, the evidence in support of this policy in most real-world settings is inadequate. In China, where HIV incidence is increasing among the general population and especially among MSM, immediate ART following diagnosis is being considered by public health authorities as a possible strategy to reduce transmission. Evaluating this strategy will require data on the cascade of HIV care including linkage to care, ART initiation, retention in care, adherence, viral suppression, and HIV transmission risk to HIV-negative partners. We are therefore proposing a strategic international collaboration between the University of Toronto and the  Shanghai Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Shanghai CDC) to conduct a three-phase observational study that will investigate: (1) background HIV care indicators drawing on surveillance data (n=9,284); (2) HIV care outcomes among HIV-positive MSM who select immediate ART (CD4>=500 cells/µL) or the current standard of care (CD4<500 cells/µL) (n=236); and (3) transmission risk among the HIV-negative partners (n=360). Methods will include a retrospective study of the Shanghai CDC database and a prospective cohort study among HIV-positive MSM and their HIV-negative partners. This study is poised to make significant scientific contributions to the global evidence-base for HIV prevention and to strengthen HIV care outcomes in China and globally."

It is now second only to cardiovascular medicine in terms of practitioners, research activities, biopharmaceutical investment and market size. Oncology has pioneered the most innovative recent approaches to translational research. In spite of its staggering expansion, a relatively small number of oncologists-the oncology ""core set""-appear to define the international research and treatment agenda, with unknown consequences for medicine and human health. Given the dominant position of oncology at the frontier of biomedical innovation, our project proposes to achieve a deep understanding of how the organization of oncology researchers shape how the system of oncology as a whole ""thinks""-what it attends to and how it searches the space of possible diagnoses and treatments in pursuit of advance. Contributions from our effort will include conceptual and empirical contributions to medical sociology, science studies, as actionable insights for health and science policy. To gain this understanding, we will deploy a ""metaknowledge"" approach that draws on digital archives and new computational tools to trace research teams and collaboration networks, investigative and clinical technologies, the myriad recombinant elements under investigation-tissues, cells, genes, proteins, biomarkers-and the changing landscape of institutions that hosts them. Specifically, we will use machine learning, natural language processing, network analysis and Bayesian modeling approaches, linked with qualitative and historical investigation of oncology's emergence and development. Together, these tools and data will allow us unprecedented, intregrative insight into how oncology ""thinks"", how it followed its particular path of innovation, and the possible consequences of that path for biomedical insight and human health."

Increased rates of opioid-related harm are reflected in maternal opioid use and Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome, a condition where infants exposed to opioids in utero experience withdrawal symptoms after birth. While poor health outcomes in infants have been documented, the developmental and long-term health outcomes associated with prenatal opioid exposure are poorly understood. The objective of this research is to estimate the effect of prenatal opioid exposure on infant health outcomes, developmental health in children and mental health and addiction outcomes among youth in Ontario. We have a unique opportunity in Ontario to explore these relationships through linked health, demographic and educational databases available at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences. This project will enhance our understanding of the long-term ramifications of the opioid crisis on prenatally exposed infants by being the first study to include prenatal prescription opioid exposure for the whole population of Ontario (including type, timing and duration of exposure) that accounts for a range of variables including maternal and family vulnerabilities known to influence child health and development- providing rigorous estimates of the impact in a Canadian context. We will compare the health of children with prenatal opioid exposure to children who were not exposed to estimate the effect of prenatal opioid exposure on child health and development. The opioid crisis and increase in Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome incidence make prenatal opioid exposure a major public health concern. Through rigorous and well-powered analyses this project will address a critical knowledge gap by identifying specific health risks and developmental deficits associated with prenatal opioid exposure. Findings can be used to inform perinatal and maternal care and to develop targeted health interventions to support healthy child development."

Pregnancy rates among people with disabilities have increased over the past two decades in Ontario. People with disabilities are more likely than those without to experience health disparities, including adverse perinatal health outcomes. A common concern among people with disabilities is the use of multiple medicines to manage symptoms and complications of disability, and overprescribing, among which, opioids are commonly prescribed. Prenatal medication use can have adverse effects on perinatal health; however, little is known about medication use in pregnancy among people with disabilities in Canada. Our aim is to describe the prevalence and patterns of medication use in pregnancy among people with disabilities overall, and by disability group and medication type, and determine the impact of disability and medication use on perinatal health. We will use information from linked health care records for all birthing parent-infant pairs in Ontario from 2014-2021. In our analyses, we will estimate the prevalence and describe medication use patterns, including opioid, psychotropic, anticonvulsant and antibacterial use, before and in pregnancy among people with and without disabilities. We will follow a subgroup of people with opioid use in pregnancy and 12 months postpartum to determine whether people with disabilities compared to those without are at an increased risk of opioid dependence or overdose. Finally, we will determine whether prenatal medication use partly explains the elevated risk of adverse birth outcomes among people with disabilities compared to those without disabilities. Our findings will provide new information to create tailored preconception and perinatal health care for pregnant people with disabilities and will inform the development of accessible and inclusive medication management counselling."

Research work to date has informed both the implementation of an Aboriginal-led intervention in emergency departments and the delineation of sensitive access indicators. Stories of Aboriginal people in emergency show that the presence of an Aboriginal health worker (Community Health Representative-CHRs) eases their experience in emergency and assists them to better understand the pathway of care. The overall research goal is to promote the development and implementation of equitable pathways to access health and health care with Aboriginal peoples and low income populations. Research objectives include (1) to develop and implement an urban access pathway in Edmonton through collaboration with city hospitals and a primary health care centre that serves a large Aboriginal and low income population; (2) to continue to develop a rural pathway to increase access for rural Aboriginal peoples and low income individuals; and (3) to delineate a global pathway to increase access for Indigenous peoples and low income populations in Chile and Uganda. Pathway components include activities to further advance our understanding of the access needs of these populations; the implementation of a population health intervention to increase access to health services; and knowledge translation. Public education; policy analysis, and advocacy work are key strategies. We follow the principles of Indigenous research and participatory methodologies. Pathways will be developed in collaboration with community partners, decision-makers in the public health sector, and researchers. Research outcomes have potential to inform policy development and public health programs with population health interventions to lessen the burden of inequities of vulnerable populations."
Development and application of analytical methods for network meta-analysis to assess the safety of drugs and improve the health of Canadians,"['Cameron, Chris G']",['N/A'],"['Bayesian Methods', 'Drug Safety', 'Epidemiology', 'Evidence Synthesis', 'Health Research Methodology', 'Indirect Comparisons', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Network Meta-Analysis', 'Population Health']",150000.0,247858,"Novel methods are needed to assess the safety of drugs. Current approaches are limited because drug safety information is often considered in isolation and valuable information is not integrated together. The proposed area of research is related to the development and application of a methodology, known as network meta analysis, for assessing drug safety. The differences between current approaches for assessing drug safety and the proposed network meta analysis approach can be summarized using a sportsbook analogy. Current approaches are analogous to a sportsbook only considering past games between two teams of interest when establishing odds for a game. A network meta analysis approach is analogous to a sportsbook establishing odds based on all information from all previous games played by all teams. To explore the application of network meta analysis for assessing drug safety, we will consider two demonstration projects using real world safety data: (1.) risk of serious infection using biologics; (2) retrospective analysis which re-investigates past drug safety issues (e.g., adverse events with use of thiazolidinediones or selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors). By advancing the development, application, and methodologies of network meta-analysis, we should obtain a more accurate picture of a drug safety profile earlier in the product lifecycle and hence decrease the risks associated by drugs used by Canadians. Our research will also contribute to advancement of knowledge in this field. We will conduct theoretical research to adapt the methods and procedures that are currently applied for assessing efficacy to evaluate uncommon or rare safety events."

Those who are faced with both diabetes and homelessness often struggle to do the things that their healthcare team may ask them to do. Additionally, both of these conditions are highly stigmatized and take a toll of individuals' mental health status. This results in this population having more diabetes complications and earlier death compared to those who are housed.

Our objective is to raise awareness of these particular challenges for those who work in the homeless-serving sector as frontline workers, in addition to working with decision-makers that affect these populations in order to revisit policies to better address peoples' needs. 

We will accomplish these objectives through three inter-related knowledge mobilization activities:
(1) Screening of the short film, Low, to shelter staff audiences throughout the province of Alberta. This film depicts the challenges and struggles of living with diabetes while experiencing homelessness, based on real-life stories of the team's co-researchers who have lived experience of diabetes and homelessness.

(2) Co-creation of a study group discussion guide that will be used to supplement the experience of viewers who see the film. This resource will help people to consolidate and solidify their knowledge of the topics depicted in the movie, and help them to reflect upon their own practices and behaviours and how these could be altered.

(3) Hosting of a provincial summit on diabetes among people experiencing homelessness that will be held in conjunction with the 7-Cities Conference on Housing and Homelessness in the Spring of 2025. Relevant stakeholders at a variety of levels will gather together to discuss, brainstorm and work towards potential policy solutions to address the challenges faced by this population.

Using this knowledge mobilization approach, we feel confident that we will impact the lives of those living with diabetes and homelessness in Alberta."

For my doctoral research, I will explore the influence of dominate culture in health institutions within the federal (FNIHB) and Ontario health systems on the provision of maternity care provided to First Nations people evacuated out of their communities to give birth. I will examine documentary data, including organizational and institutional documents, from provincial hospitals and the Ontario health system, as well as FNIHB nursing stations located in Ontario pertaining to protocols and policies around care during evacuation for birth and care for Indigenous Peoples. I will interview between 50-64 maternity care providers, including midwives, physicians, nurses, and birth support workers, who have worked at an institution within the Ontario health system or at FNIHB nursing stations and have had cared for First Nations people evacuated out of their community for birth. Data will be analyzed firstly to understand how the beliefs held by individuals and teams of maternity care providers, healthcare institutions, and health systems create a culture surrounding maternity care within Ontario and secondly to understand how this culture's influence on care provided within the Ontario health system and FNIHB to First Nations people evacuated out of their communities to give birth. Anti-oppressive theory, a framework that examines oppression with the intention to combat it, is used to understand care provider's beliefs influencing oppressive care. The results of this study will demonstrate where changes within maternity culture need to be made to provide anti-oppressive birth care to First Nations peoples."

Stigma is a significant problem for those living with mental health concerns and is a major barrier to accessible care, recovery and quality of life. Aboriginal people with mental health concerns can experience double stigma; encountering health care practitioners who do not fully appreciate the impact of their historical and current realities. Further, the health care providers may feel overwhelmed and inadequate in their ability to help.
The Mental Health Commission of Canada evaluated a training program, Cognitive Behavioural Interpersonal Skills (CBIS) and found positive, favourable results in effectiveness for reducing mental illness related stigma among healthcare providers and lent further evidence to the theory that increasing healthcare providers' skills, confidence and comfort in treating people with mental illness can reduce stigma.
A collaborative partnership between CBIS and Tillicum Lelum Aboriginal Friendship Centre on Vancouver Island BC, enabled the CBIS training and materials to be made more culturally relevant through the inclusion of cultural competency training  and direct reference to Indigenous ways of supporting mental health.
In 2015, two ""CBIS Indigenous Approach"" workshops were held that brought together approximately 200 primary care practitioners (family doctors, nurses, students) and  Nanaimo and Cowichan Tribes First Nations health, housing and educational programs. Evaluations and post workshop focus groups showed very positive responses.
This grant would facilitate  partnerships within BC and also with Ontario's Lakehead University to examine CBIS Indigenous Approach for its potential as a culturally safe and relevant primary mental health care educational strategy for providers working with Aboriginal persons and investigate the effect of the training on reducing stigma."

The warning labels include a message to motivate smokers to quit, colour pictures to get smokers' attention and a toll-free phone number and website for help with quitting.  Smokers who call the toll-free number will be immediately connected to a quitline where trained cessation counsellors talk with smokers by phone and help them quit.  The quitlines offer advice tailored to the needs of the smoker, motivation to quit, knowledge about the quitting process and skills they can use to successfully quit.  Our research team is interested in knowing if smokers from vulnerable populations (aboriginals, rural smokers, those with low education)are more likely to call the quitline and more likely to quit when the toll-free number is immediately available right on the cigarette package.  We are also interested in knowing if health professionals are more likely to refer smokers to the quitline because the new warning labels make their patients and themselves more aware of the need to quit and available help. We will compare the percent of smokers in the population who receive help from the quitline and the percent of referrals from health professionals before and after the new warning labels are available.  Results for this study will inform quitline operators and policymakers about best ways to provide smokers with assistance in quitting."
Contextualizing the Delivery of a Public Health Nurse Home Visiting Intervention Program in Rural Canada,"['Campbell, Karen A']",['N/A'],['Population And Public Health'],1500.0,383169,"Living in social or economic disadvantage is associated with negative health outcomes for Canadian families. Young mothers and their children are one such group at risk for suboptimal health outcomes, creating a significant public health concern. Rural living creates additional challenges for young mothers, some who are greatly in need of supportive nursing interventions. Rural residents have poorer health status, fewer available health resources, and greater difficulty accessing health services despite their significant need for primary health care. Public health nurses are ideally positioned to promote health behaviours intended to prevent illness, injuries, and substance misuse for families, especially those living in social or economic disadvantage. The Nurse-Family Partnership (NFP) is a targeted public health intervention program designed to improve child and maternal health through nurse home visiting. The purpose of this research is to describe and explore how rural geography influences the implementation and delivery of the NFP program in British Columbia, Canada. I will examine the experiences of public health nurses and supervisors delivering NFP in non-urban communities to provide an understanding of how the program is implemented within the context of rural geography. Because text-messaging clients is becoming necessary to facilitate delivery of home-visiting programs, I will also examine structure and content of the public health mobile phone communication policies and procedures. This exploration will help to understand if these policies are robust enough to support the ways in which public health nurses are using this technology. Knowledge gained from my study will contribute to the development of a rural model to inform the scale-up implementation of the NFP in Canada, including recommendations for telecommunication policy development."

While public health units are involved in screening and monitoring substances in Europe, there is no drug monitoring system in place in North America.  In order to increase knowledge exchange among public health units its imperative that drug checking is implemented as a drug monitoring tool in Canada.  This form of knowledge exchange has been well established, with advanced methodologies being used for the past 15 years in Europe, partnering nightlife harm reduction services with public health to monitor the quality of drugs, and alert both drug users and health services when bad batched arise.  Canadian Students for Sensible Drug Policy is advocating nationally for drug checking services, and is partnering with researchers and knowledge users to bring European drug monitoring systems to Canada in order to increase knowledge on emerging substances and save lives through accessible drug checking services in nightlife settings."
Fetal programming of infant stress reactivity,"['Campbell, Tavis S', 'Letourneau, Nicole L']","['Giesbrecht, Gerald F', 'Kaplan, Bonnie J', 'Kooistra, Libbe', 'Pop, Victor']","['Cortisol', 'Fetal/Infant Development', 'Heart Rate Variability', 'Maternal Psychological Distress', 'Mother-Infant Interaction', 'Stress Reactivity']",411738.0,199078,"Recent studies suggest that pregnant women who report high levels of stress, anxiety, or depression have babies who are at increased risk for poor developmental outcomes. For example, infants of distressed mothers have a higher incidence of 'difficult' temperament, behavioural and emotional problems, and physical disease. Unfortunately, these effects can last a lifetime.
    Research also suggests that when women are stressed, anxious, or depressed during pregnancy, the way in which these psychological problems affect their babies is through 'stress hormones'. Exposure to maternal stress hormones during formation of the baby's stress response system can alter its function and make it over-reactive to stress throughout the child's life. These changes may explain why children whose mothers were distressed during pregnancy are at increased risk for developmental and health problems.
   The current proposal examines the biological processes that may cause changes in the development of babies born to stressed, anxious, or depressed mothers. The primary questions we address are: (1) does exposure to maternal stress hormones during gestation alter infants' stress responses? and (2), does the way a mother interacts with her infant after birth have the potential to change the effects of prenatal exposure to the mother's stress hormones? To address these questions, we repeatedly measure maternal cortisol during pregnancy and infant stress reactivity at 3 and 6 months of age.
   Given that the prevalence of harmful levels of stress, anxiety, and depression in expectant mothers is high (13%), understanding the association between maternal stress hormones and infant stress responses has the potential to influence policies aimed at reducing psychological distress in mothers in the prenatal and postpartum periods. Children and society stand to gain from reducing the health and developmental problems associated with exposure to maternal distress during pregnancy."
A comprehensive evaluation of infectious disease burden in Ontario,"['Campitelli, Michael A']",['N/A'],"['Decision-Making', 'Disease Burden', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Population Health', 'Public Health']",105000.0,257404,"With recent outbreaks of emerging and re-emerging diseases such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, measles, and pandemic H1N1 influenza, infectious diseases have regained prominence in the public's mind. However, since infectious diseases vary heavily with respect to duration of illness, frequency of infection, and severity of outcome, it can be difficult to determine which specific infectious diseases have the most negative impact on population health. Setting priorities for population health issues is increasingly important for rationally distributing scarce health resources. Determining the population health burden from specific diseases is one method that decision-makers can use when allocating resources. To calculate disease burden, studies use metrics that allows for the simultaneous description of both mortality (deaths occurring before a pre-specified life expectancy) and morbidity (reduced functioning or suboptimal state of health associated with diseases or injuries). This project will use routinely collected data from Ontario to determine the mortality and incidence due to an extensive list of infectious diseases (over 50). Standard burden of disease methodology will then be used to summarize the relative impact on population health of these infectious diseases. Additionally, this project will establish whether the burden of infectious diseases varies with subgroups of the population such as new immigrants, those with lower socio-economic status, and individuals with pre-existing health conditions. This study will also look at the risk factors of infection to determine which are contributing the most to infectious disease burden. This information will be extremely helpful to decision-makers to guide public health policy, planning, and research and ensure that health resources are being invested in the diseases that matter most to the health of the population."

This increase is considered to be due to the rise in smoking among women after World War II. However, much of the data we have on the prevalence of COPD is from self-report surveys, or large-scale epidemiological studies (many of which have been conducted outside Canada).  We have little understanding about the prevalence, diagnostic patterns and management of COPD in Canadian women and how these compare to men.  The purpose of this study is to conduct an indepth analysis of the prevalence, diagnostic patterns and management of COPD in women compared to men, using data from the BC Linked Health Database.  The BC Linked Health Database is a collection of databases that record physician visits, medication use, hospitalizations and mortality for the residents of BC, and provides a rich and detailed source of data from 1992 - 2004.  Results from this study will improve our understanding of COPD in general and in women in particular."
National Deliberative Dialogue on Reaching the HIV Undiagnosed: Scaling up effective programming approaches to HIV Testing and Linkage to Prevention and Care,"['Canadian Aids Treatment, Information Exchange']","['Buchner, Christopher S', 'Elliott, Richard', 'Mcgee, Frank', 'Pindera, Carla', 'Haig, Thomas A', 'Leonard, Lynne E', 'Rourke, Sean B', 'Steben, Marc']","['Hiv Testing', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Implemenation Science', 'Knowledge Exchange']",15000.0,343492,"HIV testing is a gateway to the continuum of prevention and care and the key to ending the epidemic. Early HIV diagnosis and initiation of treatment is crucial for optimal health and can avert deaths. For people living with HIV and at risk, benefits of diagnosis also come through linkage to other services; diagnosis is also an effective means of preventing transmission. These benefits are dependent on HIV testing, and testing early.  

In Canada, we are not doing well at diagnosing HIV and engaging people in care. Of the approximately 75,500 people who live with HIV in Canada, as many as 21% are unaware of their status. This group may account for more than 50% of new infections. Many people are being diagnosed late in HIV infection; there is room for improvement in our effort to ensure linkage to care. Canada urgently needs to investigate better ways to reach the undiagnosed and engage them in the HIV care continuum.

An improved effort to reach the undiagnosed includes the implementation of new program approaches based on new understandings of HIV, as well as the scale-up of existing effective approaches. Some of this knowledge is being taken up in practice in Canada, but this is occurring very unevenly, a limitation to our ability to improve diagnoses and linkage. We need to investigate effective strategies that have earlier detection, higher uptake, and more effective linkage outcomes; this knowledge needs to be gathered, synthesized, and shared. 

This deliberative dialogue will bring together  HIV experts from across Canada, including policy makers, researchers and providers to discuss effective approaches to HIV testing and linkage following diagnosis, and how these approaches can be integrated into existing systems of care. Invitees will articulate priority directions for programming and research in Canada based on evidence of effective testing approaches. CATIE will synthesize this knowledge for national uptake among testing stakeholders across Canada."

Our overarching objective is to build capacity amongst knowledge users, practitioners, and researchers for undertaking high quality health impact assessments (HIA), developing health action plans, and designing effective tools for monitoring, surveillance and program evaluation in EI settings. Participants will be drawn from knowledge user, practitioner, and research communities in Mongolia, other LMICs where Canadian mining interests are dominant, and Canada.  The hands-on, problem-focused curriculum will draw on case studies developed from and applied to the Mongolian case - a country experiencing rapid growth of the EI sector -- though the basic conceptual foundation of the approach will be easily translatable to other settings.  The length and intensity of this  Summer Institute is designed to create deep expertise in HIA and related methods in EI settings, and thereby to enable participants to become, in turn, experts or ""trainers of trainers,"" when they return to their home countries and institutions.  The expertise that we propose to develop is a critical need in many LMICs, and given Canada's global reach in the EI sector (including Mongolia), it is appropriate, indeed morally imperative, to call on Canadian expertise to develop effective governance of the EI sector."

The faces of long-term care: How interpersonal relationships enhance the culture of care,"['Canham, Sarah']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,324269,"Institutional long-term care (LTC) settings have been acknowledged as environments that detract from older adults' health and well-being. To explore how a sense of home, a positive culture of care, and resident wellness could be cultivated within an institutional design, we analyzed data from 30 interviews and 5 focus groups with care staff from two LTC facilities. We found that it was the people-the caring ""faces"" residents saw everyday-and the strong relationships they built with staff that promoted a sense of home and wellness for both staff and residents. Care staff report that they consider residents to be their family and that this feeling is mutual. Despite being in an institutional setting, a sense of home was achieved through relationships. Identifying care staff and fellow residents as family improves residents' sense of comfort, care, and familiarity. Though participants did not view institutional environments positively, they articulated that the relationships and sense of family within the environment were as important as the physical space itself to residents' wellness and the culture of care. As residents become used to the staff and other residents in their environment-those with whom they eat meals or first see in the morning-family-like ties are developed. In LTC settings where the environment cannot be modified, it is important to promote continuity in care staff and resident relationships."
Investigating the Association between Infant Feeding Methods and Newborn Outcomes Following In-utero Exposure to Antidepressant Medication: A Multiple Methods Study,"['Cantin, Christina']",['N/A'],"['Antidepressant Medication Exposure', 'Breastfeeding', 'Human Milk Feeding', 'Mental Health', 'Newborn Withdrawal', 'Perinatal Depression', 'Poor Neonatal Adaptation', 'Postnatal Outcomes', 'Retrospective Cohort Study', 'Scoping Review']",105000.0,458784,"Overview: Due to the COVID pandemic, more Canadian mothers are telling their doctors, midwives, and nurses about feelings of depression and anxiety. Community supports like peer support groups and counselling are helpful for many mothers, but some may need to take medications during pregnancy. It is good to treat depression to prevent problems for the mother and baby. Some babies, whose mothers takes these medications for depression, may cry a lot, have trouble breathing, be really sleepy, or have a hard time feeding. These babies need extra health care and support. We don't know if breastfeeding can help to lower these events, but we do know that breastfeeding helps babies of mothers who took other kinds of medication in pregnancy. This study will look at how the feeding method (breastfeeding, formula, or mixed feeding) might change a baby's health when the mom used medication for depression in pregnancy.  

Anticipated Outcomes: We think that babies who breastfeed or get breastmilk in a bottle will be able to stay in the room with their parents after birth, spend less time in hospital, and will not need to go to the emergency room, or be readmitted to the hospital. 

Contributions to the field: Medications for depression have been used for many years in pregnancy. We are still learning information about the best way to care for mothers and their babies. We will share the findings of this study with women and doctors, nurses, and midwives. This sharing will help people to make decisions that are best for them and their babies. Parents may choose to breastfeed or provide breastmilk to their baby if they know extra health care may not be needed for their baby. The findings of this study can be added to care plans in Ontario and across Canada. Because mental health affects overall wellbeing, we think that families, health care providers, health system leaders, and policy makers will be interested in this study."
Cafe Scientifique event - childhood obesity - its causes and complications,"['Capaldi, Julia']",['N/A'],['Cafe Scientifique'],3000.0,208786,"In the past, many people thought that obesity was simply caused by overeating and under-exercising, resulting from a lack of will power and self-control. Although these are significant contributing factors, doctors recognize that obesity is a complex medical problem that involves genetic, environmental, behavioural, and social factors. All these factors play a role in determining a person's weight.

Whatever the causes, the facts are that child obesity causes illnesses, child obesity reduces life expectancy, and child obesity can destroy a child's self-esteem.  Parents and caregivers need to arm themselves with the knowledge and skills to help Canada's youth grow into healthy, productive adults.

This event will provide an opportunity for Lawson's internationally-recognized scientists to share their research expertise with the general public by addressing childhood obesity, its causes and outcomes."

The project's goal is to address a current unmet need in head/neck cancer care and respond directly by delivering an intervention combining physical activity, nutritional and educational elements. Research on physical activity and nutrition interventions to positively impact symptom management, treatment-related recovery and quality of life, has largely excluded head/neck cancer populations. This translates into a lack of clinical programming available for these patients. This research is necessary because head/neck cancer patients deal with severe weight loss; with upwards of 70% attributed to lean muscle wasting, leading to extended recovery times, decreased quality of life, impaired physical functioning, and delayed return to work. To date, interventions to address body composition issues have focused solely on diet, despite findings that nutritional therapy alone is insufficient. A combined lifestyle intervention, that also incorporates important educational components, is necessary. Our pilot work suggests large patient demand and clinic support from the health care professionals. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to investigate the specific benefits of this lifestyle program on patient body composition, physical functioning, blood markers, quality of life, smoking status, depression and return to work. Further, this research will evaluate the effectiveness of this lifestyle intervention at different time points along the cancer care trajectory to identify the most effective clinical intervention point in patient care. This study will promote advancements in cancer survivorship and our work will result in a sustainable, evidence-based program that can be implemented in cancer centers across Canada."

The proposed research will investigate connections between bullying, mental health, and peer relationships as they develop among elementary school children. Different patterns of bullying and victimization experiences will be examined over three years among elementary school children. Mental health problems will be explored as potential predictors and consequences of bullying and victimization involvement over time. It is hypothesized that mental health problems such as aggressive and defiant behaviours will be associated with bullying, while mental health problems such as depression and anxiety will be related to victimization. In addition, peer relationships will be explored as risk and protective factors for children with different levels of involvement in bullying and victimization. It is hypothesized that negative peer contexts (antisocial peers, exclusive peer dynamics, etc.) will place children at risk for bullying and victimization, while positive peer contexts (supportive peers, inclusive peer dynamics, etc.) will protect children from bullying and victimization. Finally, rates of bystander intervention during bullying, reasons for intervening (or not), and individual characteristics that may predict intervention will be examined. It is hypothesized that confidence in one's ability to influence peers will predict intervention for girls and empathy will predict intervention for boys. Healthy peer relationships are essential for fostering mental health among Canadian youth. Taken together, this research will provide crucial information about bullying prevention and intervention to educators and health professionals across Canada. Workshops and written materials based on findings will be distributed to parents, educators, and health professionals to promote healthy peer relationships among Canadian children."

Afro descendants make up 30% of the population in the Latin American region and in Montreal and Toronto, the most diverse cities in Canada, Afro descendants make up 10% and 4% of the population, respectively. Likewise, are a growing population in Montreal (5%) and Toronto (3%). Yet, Afro descendants and Latinx individual, although invisibilized populations, are overrepresented on the burden of COVID-19, police fatal encounters and chronic conditions.

Potential ZIKV-related adverse outcomes are: congenital malformations (called as well Congenital Zika Syndrome or CZS), pregnancy loss, neonatal and child mortality, and developmental issues. However their assessment is threatened by the absence of, or lack of good quality data, and a series of biases that are not often accounted for when analyzing ZIKV-related data. 

Zika is a virus mostly transmitted to humans by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes, but can be transmitted vertically from pregnant individuals to their fetuses. In 2016, a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) was declared due to the increase of microcephaly in children born to ZIKV-infected pregnant individuals. After six years of the PHEIC, ZIKV is still a threat. Over 40,000 cases were reported in 14 countries of the Americas region in 2022 and still, robust estimation of the short- and long-term effects of Zika during pregnancy are lacking.

We propose a research project to contribute to the estimation of ZIKV-related risks, using data from 64 estudies (22 countries) participating in the ZIKV- Individual Participant Data (IPD) Consortium. The ZIKV-IPD consortium is an initiative led by the World Health Organization (WHO), created in 2017 to bring together multidisciplinary researchers to conduct  a synthesis of the available literature called IPD meta-analyses (IPD-MA), of ZIKV-related cohorts and surveillance-based.

Such comprehensive approach is called the One HealthTM, a term which was adopted as a Trade Mark during an Expert Consultation hosted by the Public Health Agency of Canada in 2009. Several systems to monitor infections and antibiotic resistance and use in animals and humans have been established in Canada and worldwide.

Changes in the environment, extreme weather events, and pressure on the human/wildlife interface are leading to a concerning rise in new and re-emerging zoonotic diseases. In addition, changes in population-level immunity after the Covid-19 pandemic have led to increasingly complex dynamics for pathogens, including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Influenza, and the evolving situation of (re)-emergent pathogens, such as mpox and potentially the highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N1). Understanding these complex health challenges requires expertise in each constituent part of the system, such as genomics, microbiology, ecology, and epidemiology, as well as cutting-edge statistical and mathematical techniques to provide a means to synthesize and make sense of the whole system. With the ongoing growth in environmental and animal data availability, such as wastewater data, there is a need to develop an ecosystem view of all exposures and their effects and to deploy new analytical tools which could combine environmental, clinical, and animal data to promote evidence-based public health decisions.  Developing such methods will allow for a better understanding of disease dynamics that accounts for its full ecology within the one health context and has the potential to provide a robust and reliable way to estimate incidence, severe outcomes, growth rate, and forecasting.    

This research program will ultimately support the modelling of the relationship between wastewater data and dynamics of disease to inform early warning systems.

Examining how gay and bi- men in Vancouver use various drugs we used a statistical procedure called latent transition analysis--which enabled us to identify distinct patterns of substance use and HIV vulnerability. At baseline, most gay and bi-men exhibited ""normal"" patterns of consumption: 25% exhibited only limited drug use and 27% exhibited pretty conventional patterns of use (e.g., tobacco, alcohol and marijuana). However, 11% exhibited patterns characteristic of sex drug use (e.g., erectile dysfunction drugs, methamphetamine, poppers, and ecstasy), 12% exhibited club drug use (e.g., alcohol, ecstasy, cocaine, poppers, and shrooms), 12% reported using common street drugs (e.g., opioids), and about 13.4% exhibited polydrug use (e.g., heavy use use of most drugs). 

Across two and a half years, 26% of men transitioned between classes; the prevalence of limited use trended upwards (Baseline:24.5%, Visit 5:28.3%) and assorted use trended downwards (13.4% to 9.6%). Notable transition pathways included reciprocal transitions between 'conventional use' and 'club drug use,' and 'street drug use' and 'assorted use'. However, all classes had strong longitudinal stability highlighting the need for socially tailored interventions to promote HIV-risk reduction and safe drug use."

In our living meta-analysis (see https://www.casch.ca/mortality), we found that, across 132 studies published between 1980 and 2021, social disconnection was associated with a 27% increase in mortality. This finding is consistent with two previous meta-analyses by Holt-Lunstad et al. (2010, 2015), which showed that healthy social relationships are associated with a 26-50% reduction in mortality-estimates rivalling those of other major risk factors for death, including obesity (Hazard Ratio = 1.08), sedentary living (HR = 1.05), high blood pressure (HR = 1.32), high cholesterol (HR = 1.04), and air pollution (HR = 1.07). The list of diseases and conditions that are associated with social disconnection is expansive: cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, substance use disorder, anxiety, and depression, to name a few. However, most people do not understand the importance of social connectedness to their health, happiness, and well-being. As such, we propose a six-part webinar discussion series called ""Connected Conversations,"" which focuses on synthesizing personal stories with high-quality science to explore the cascading consequences of social disconnection and explore what we can do as (1) individuals; (2) families and friends; (3) community organizations; (4) schools and workplaces; (5) businesses; and (6) non-profit and government agencies to address the crisis of loneliness facing Canada in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic."

Drawing on interdisciplinary and intersectoral expertise, this proposal will leverage effective research partnerships and engagement with experts at all stages, to triangulate and corroborate data through local knowledge generation and dissemination. Further, this project seeks to develop a composite score to monitor performance across the food system and related subsystems to help identify potential synergies and to reveal trade-offs between economic, environmental and social sustainability. As there are no one-size-fits-all solutions, country-level experiences provide illustrative examples of what it takes - in very practical and innovative ways - to transform food systems to reduce the DBM. Findings from each case study will allow for the development of comprehensive policies aimed at both the food and natural environments, resulting in a more coordinated governance of food, effective investments and co-benefits to human health and the environment."

Today, DTC-GT refers to the analysis of specific genetic variants associated with an increased or decreased disease risk. Soon, DTC-GT companies will expand their offerings to include whole genome sequencing, permitting analysis of an individual's complete genetic code. Little empirical data exists regarding the motivations of consumers, the ability of DTC-GT to improve health, or its impact on the health system; however, the Canadian College of Medical Geneticists has warned of the potential for DTC-GT to drain public resources without improving patient care. The Impact of Personal Genomes study at Brigham & Women's Hospital (Boston MA) has compiled, in cooperation with two commercial genomics companies, a sample of 1 740 DTC-GT customers. Study participants have completed 3 surveys: one prior to testing, another shortly after receiving their results, and a third 6 months later. Data has been collected regarding motivations, health/family history, health behaviors, genetic knowledge, risk perception, emotional impact, and health service use. My research will investigate why customers choose to undergo DTC-GT, the impact of DTC-GT on personal health and the health system, and the role of genetic literacy (functional genetic knowledge) on these outcomes. I will also define factors that predict whether or not, after testing, consumers: (1) discuss their results with a physician, (2) modify health behaviors, and (3) receive additional screening or specialist health services. An understanding of consumer motivations, the role of genetic literacy, and the impact of DTC-GT on the health care system will facilitate the development of informed and appropriate practice guidelines and regulatory policies in the United States and Canada."

The high quality of country food provides several essential nutrients, while the preparation and sharing of the harvests promotes harmonious relationships within the community and with the land. Inuit also get some of their food from stores selling products from southern Canada, called market food, which are not an adequate replacement for the nutritional and cultural benefits of country food. On the other hand, the Arctic is experiencing the fastest warming rate on Earth that already has important consequences on the lives of Inuit. For instance, degradation of the permafrost (permanently frozen ground) fragilizes infrastructure and disrupts habitual traveling routes for hunting; changing sea ice conditions make coastal travels increasingly dangerous; and the geographical distribution of animals and plants is changing rapidly. Yet, the effects of climate change on Inuit diet and health remain unclear and cannot be fully understood solely from an academic perspective. This study aims to bring together the scientific tools of diet modelling and the Inuit culture and knowledge of the land to identify future threats to healthy eating in Nunavik. The first phase of the project is to develop a mathematical model of the current diet to understand where Inuit get their nutrients between country and market food. The second phase will consist of imposing climate-driven changes on the accessibility of country food in the diet model to explore their theoretical consequences on the nutrient content of the diet. A series of workshops will then be organized with Nunavik's public health authorities and selected partners to develop adaptation scenarios for the third and final phase. Ultimately, this collaborative approach seeks to support Inuit self-determination in creating public health policies to adapt to climate change."
Reducing the Acute Care Burden of Childhood Asthma on Health Services in British Columbia,"['Carleton, Bruce C', 'Peterson, Robert G']","['Fatma, Taha', 'Macleod, Stuart M', 'Camp, Pat', 'Goldman, Ran D', 'Levy, Adrian R', 'Mitton, Craig R']","['Asthma', 'Burden Of Illness', 'Emergency Room', 'Health System Improvement', 'Paediatrics']",116499.0,185287,"In Canada, asthma affects more than 12% of children. Many experience 'attacks' which are acute periods of worsening asthma symptoms linked to a variety of triggers. Over 80% of asthma attacks are triggered by upper respiratory tract virus infections or 'colds'. Currently, asthma attacks due to such infections are a major cause of Emergency Department visits, missed school days, sleep disruption and restricted physical activity in children. 

This project addresses two problems: a lack of precise information about the impact of severe asthma attacks in children on the health care system (information that can be used to target improvements in asthma care) and a lack of widespread use of a recommended strategy for preventing many such attacks. This strategy involves taking oral steroids for several days at the first sign of a cold or flu.

The project will begin with a detailed analysis of provincial health data concerning use of hospital and physician services and medications by children who experience asthma attacks and will provide regional Health Authority planners with information they can use in identifying areas for service improvement. The second stage of the project is an evaluation of the effects of using the preventive oral steroid strategy with Emergency Department asthma patients at BC Children's Hospital. This evaluation will study changes in quality of life in children who use the strategy compared with those who do not as well as changes in future use of the Emergency Department for asthma attacks.

The project team will include health care decision makers as well as clinicians and researchers to ensure that the results are widely communicated to health care providers who are in a position to make improvements in care."

Despite a plethora of interventions designed to mitigate risk and build resiliency among PSP, there is limited evidence of their effectiveness (Beshai et al., 2016; Carleton, Afifi, et al., 2019). Longitudinal research with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, led by Carleton, is underway to examine the effects of two programs deployed during cadet training: 1) Unified Protocol (UP) cognitive behavioural training; and 2) Psychological Safety (PS) workplace training for leaders. Initial results are expected in late 2019.

There is clear urgency to address PTSIs across all PSP sectors. The current study will examine the question, ""Does administering tailored UP training to four frontline PSP sectors, and Psychological Safety training to their leaders, help protect PSP mental health?"" The study will combine self-reported mental health determinant data (e.g., traumatic experiences), physiological measures (e.g., heart rate), and clinical interviews to investigate PTSI determinants.

A mixed-methods design with sex-disaggregated and gender analyses will be used. Sector-specific tailored UP and PS training will be provided to frontline PSP (i.e., communications, firefighters, paramedics, municipal police; N=200) and leaders. Clinical assessments will be taken at baseline (T1), post-training (T2), and 12-month follow-up (T3). Self-report data will be collected daily (<1 min) and monthly (~30 mins). Physiological data will be collected daily while on duty using wearable technology. Focus groups will be conducted with frontline PSP (T2,3) and leaders (T1,2,3).

The study will build much needed capacity for extending RCMP study protocols to other PSP sectors. We anticipate the tailored augmented training will build PSP psychological resiliency and reduce PTSI symptoms."

The proposed study extends the RCMP Study to four other PSP groups-emergency communications, firefighters, municipal police, and paramedics-by tailoring the RCMP Study infrastructure for a broader PSP community. Participants from the four PSP groups will receive 13 hours of mental health skills training based on the well-supported Unified Protocol (UP) for cognitive behavioural therapy, but tailored specifically for diverse PSP. Second, the PSP participants' leaders will be provided with the same skills plus specialized training for building psychologically safe workplaces for high stress professions. Participants will be assessed with detailed self-report surveys and clinical interviews at pre-, post-, and 12-months after the training to assess the impact on their mental health. Participants will also complete short monthly surveys and very short daily surveys. The assessments provide ongoing mental health feedback so participants in need can get help faster. Participants can also evaluate their training experience during focus group discussions. Speciality technology will be pilot-tested to assess whether a PTSI can be identified using biological signals. Overall, the results will indicate whether the diverse assessments and tailored training can support the mental health needs of a more diverse community of frontline PSP and leaders."

Diesel Exhaust and Mechanisms of Asthma,"['Carlsten, Christopher']","['Brauer, Michael', 'Fitzgerald, J M', 'Turvey, Stuart E']","['Asthma', 'Diesel', 'Human', 'Oxidative Stress']",565014.0,255116,"Asthma has major health consequences and economic consequences the world over. The airways of people with asthma are inflamed and react to irritants by narrowing and making it more difficult to breathe. This typically results in an ""asthma exacerbation"" whereby the asthmatic experiences shortness of breath, at minimum, and may need urgent medical attention. 

Diesel exhaust (DE) is associated with asthma exacerbations, but how and why this occurs is unclear. One proposition is that DE causes ""oxidative stress"", which is damage to cells and body tissues due to certain chemical characteristics of DE particles. Recently, we have shown that oxidative stress is responsible for airway narrowing in asthmatics. We now want to know if this is made worse by the addition of a common allergen (such as that from grass or the birch tree). 

In our lab, we create DE and finely control its concentration while volunteers inhale it for 2 hours. The concentration of DE is typical of that in a mining operation or on the streets of several developing cites in Asia. Such a short exposure time has no permanent effects but can reveal mild changes in the airways and blood (these return completely back to normal within hours) to help us decide if our hypothesis is correct. Each volunteer subject is exposed, on different days, to DE and to clean air. We after the DE (or clean air) exposure, we add allergen (grass or birch) to the lung, to see if that worsens the effect of DE, and to create the ""real world"" situation (where multiple asthma triggers are present at one time). 

This research will allow a better understanding of DE-related airways disease, help workers' advocates and compensation boards better understand the harms of occupational exposure to diesel exhaust, and inform evolving measures to protect all Canadians exposed to traffic-related pollution (such as recommendations regarding exhaust filters or fuel composition, or personal anti-oxidant supplements)."

There is a possibility that taking these medications affects a worker's ability to return to work and remain productive at work, but little research has been conducted to test this theory. In addition to pain, injured workers often experience depression symptoms - these symptoms could influence the relationship between prescription pain medications and work ability. My project will attempt to provide a better understanding of the patterns of pain medication prescriptions over time after a workplace injury and how these patterns may influence a worker's return to work and work functioning. I will analyze data from a large two-year study of Ontario workers' compensation claimants with back and upper extremity injuries. The data comes from the Ontario Workplace Safety & Insurance Board as well as from workers' responses to questionnaires. I will use this data to describe prescription patterns, such as the types of medications being prescribed, how often they are prescribed, and in what amount. I will examine whether certain factors are related to these patterns - for instance, whether the worker is a man or woman or whether the worker has received other types of healthcare. I will then examine how patterns of prescriptions may impact on how long a worker is off work, whether they experience multiple episodes of work absence, and whether they have difficulties functioning when they are at work. I will take into consideration whether depression symptoms influence these relationships. The results of this research project will ultimately help us to better understand the pain medications being prescribed to workers and how they may help or hinder the ability to work after a workplace injury."

There is growing interest in the role of medical cannabis for the treatment of work-related health conditions. However, we know virtually nothing about how workers with work-related conditions use cannabis and how their use may relate to recovery.

We are conducting a survey of 1,200 Ontario workers 18 months after filing a workers' compensation claim for a work-related health condition. Early results demonstrate that 31% of workers used cannabis in the past year, 43% of whom used cannabis to cope with their work-related condition. Importantly, 96% of respondents agreed to be re-contacted, providing an opportunity to extend the current study to generate new knowledge on cannabis use and associated recovery outcomes over the long-term following a work-related condition.

The proposed mixed-methods study will consist of conducting both surveys and in-depth interviews with the same group of workers 30 months after they first filed their claim. The goals of this study are to describe detailed cannabis use patterns in this population, identify the factors workers consider in deciding to use cannabis, seek medical authorization, and workers' compensation reimbursement; examine the factors associated with condition-related use, authorization, and reimbursement; evaluate changes in condition-related use; and examine the longitudinal impact of condition-related use on recovery outcomes.

Findings of this project will provide health care providers, injured worker advocates, and workers' compensation authorities with a knowledge base to inform policies, practices, and initiatives around cannabis use in this population, including an identification of the worker subgroups most likely to benefit from guidance around use."
Building a Program of Research on Substance Use in Working Populations: A Proposal to Attend the IPPH Starting Investigators Workshop,"['Carnide, Nancy']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,400521,"I am currently building a program of research on substance use among working populations, aimed at better understanding patterns of and risk factors for use and impairment, as well as the related occupational health and safety impacts. Research on working populations generally garners little attention in the public health domain. Yet, employed Canadians make up 63% of the population and spend much of their working life at work or commuting. Thus, substance use among workers has the potential to affect a large number of Canadians and may have spillover effects to the workplace, making workers an important population subgroup to consider.

Recent research activities conducted as part of my post-doctoral fellowship have centered primarily around cannabis use, focusing on the implications of non-medical cannabis legalization on workplace use, perceptions and knowledge of workplace use, reasons for use, and workplace cannabis culture, as well as exploring possible surveillance tools to measure the impact of legalization on occupational health and safety. I have also conducted a systematic review of the evidence on the risk of workplace injuries and fatalities associated with cannabis and select prescription drugs. As part of these initiatives, I have built participatory partnerships with various stakeholders to identify research priorities, frame research questions that are useful for policy and practice, and identify opportunities for dissemination.

This workshop represents an important opportunity to network and develop collaborative relationships with other researchers at a comparable stage in their careers, senior population and public health researchers from other jurisdictions in Canada, and stakeholders. These connections and the workshop overall will provide an opportunity to gain insights into the grant funding and peer review process and how to conduct useful and actionable research, allowing me to strengthen my future grant proposals."

Research utilizing human tissue samples is vital to the understanding of etiology, diagnosis, treatment and health care outcomes for a population.  The concept of personalized medicine should not be limited to mainstream populations, but needs to become a reality for all Canadians. A valid concern is that if First Peoples do not participate in the baseline research that will inform personalized medicine, they will not have opportunities to benefit from it. In the Carrier Sekani (CS) First Nations territory in northern British Columbia, community members are interested in discussing such biomedical research opportunities.  To move toward an ethical framework for biomedical research with these First Nations, we will engage in a community-focused dialogue.  The primary goal of our proposed meeting is to initiate the conversation about opportunities presented by biomedical research on human tissues, while learning about differences between Western and CS worldviews as they apply to this research methodology.  Through this dialogue, we will articulate challenges and derive further questions to be answered in a larger scale consultation project.  This meeting will provide the foundation for a qualitative research project to extend the consultation to a broad representation of CS community members and researchers to create a framework for respectful, engaging and ethical biomedical research practices with CS people.  With such understanding in place, the opportunity to address the gap in access to ethical biomedical research (and the health improvements that accompany it) can be addressed for the Carrier Sekani people and potentially serve as a model for other First Nations in Canada and the researchers who partner with them."
Community Social Capital and Population Health in British Columbia,"['Carpiano, Richard M']",['N/A'],"['Community Effects', 'Health Disparities', 'Health Sociology', 'Multilevel Modeling', 'Social Capital', 'Social Networks']",300000.0,192005,"The concept of community social capital--the resources that exist within community social ties and networks--has received intense interest by health researchers and policymakers.  This interest has emerged in trying to understand how the social conditions of neighborhoods and other local areas contribute to the health and well-being of residents.  However, existing data on social capital in British Columbia (BC) (as well as in Canada overall) provide insufficient information for policy and practice aimed at improving health and well-being in general and, more specifically, early childhood development (ECD)--a critical period of the lifespan for preventing or ameliorating many potentially harmful adult health outcomes.  

The objective of this project is to examine how neighborhood social networks and the resources they provide matter for the health and well-being of two subpopulations in British Columbia (BC): young children and adults.

The project will analyze a comprehensive dataset of neighborhood conditions and child and adult well-being.  Survey data on community social ties and adult health will be collected from over 3000 respondents located in 100 rural and urban BC neighborhoods.  This unprecedented BC data will be merged with area census data and an existing BC population database of kindergarteners' ECD score records.

This project has 2 major benefits.  First, it will provide an improved--and Canadian-specific--examination of the different ways that urban and rural neighborhood social conditions matter for the health and well-being of the young children and adults who live within these locations.  Second, it will provide a crucial--and rare--resource for informing policies and interventions aimed at developing neighborhoods into environments that promote health and well-being from the early years onward.  The information generated by this project will be useful for residents, parents, researchers, policymakers, and practitioners."

The first line of intervention within the Child Welfare (CW) context is to modify parenting behavior (ie increase parental sensitivity) mandated by the courts in some cases but voluntary in most cases2. Yet compliance with CW parenting interventions is poor, with 50-80% of parents not finishing the recommended intervention2. Parenting approaches developed over the last 20 years are not tailored to the needs or risk factors of CW parents which in turn negatively impact developmental outcomes of their children especially younger children (below 3), neglected and minority children.

Without early specialized intervention these children are at risk for future academic, social and mental health problems. Our current Early Childhood Education systems are not prepared for this challenge and there exists a serious service as well as policy gap to address the needs of these children and their families.  Our project team, consisting of high level policy decision-makers in the area of early intervention from the Province of Nova Scotia, has partnered with clinicians, researchers and knowledge translation scientists to synthesize evidence-based interventions to produce a 'realist review'.  Using an iterative process between policy makers and the research team, the relevant scientific literature will be synthesized to find out what interventions work, for who, and under what circumstances.  This will help translate complex research and service models into policies relevant to decision makers; a new approach to dealing with complex health needs in a vulnerable population.  The review will provide timely information to Nova Scotia decision makers as the provincial government is in the midst of re-organizing its early intervention services. In addition, our team includes researchers and clinicians from two other provinces (Quebec, Ontario) grappling with similar issues.

While lower weight gain may prevent these health outcomes, it may also increase risk of fetal growth restriction and perinatal death. Thus, public health recommendations on optimal pregnancy weight gain that balances these risks are important, especially in countries as Canada, where the proportion of overweight and obesity among women and children has been increasing. 
The goal of this project is to establish the optimal range of pregnancy weight gain for Canadian women. We will use existing medical records from approximately 560,000 women who delivered in British Columbia, Canada, between 2004 and 2018, that have been linked with longer-term health records (such as prescriptions and hospital visits). We will obtain information on total pregnancy weight gain from the obstetrical chart, and link this will 11 short- and longer-term health complications for mother and newborn, such as excess post-partum weight retention, longer-term maternal diabetes and heart disease, cesarean delivery, fetal growth restriction, and stillbirth or infant death. We will use a statistical modelling approach that is able to consider all possible adverse health outcomes at the same time, while accounting for the fact that some outcomes are more serious than others. We will also examine how recommendations change according to a woman's pre-pregnancy weight.
Our findings could provide the basis for new recommendations on pregnancy weight gain to be used during prenatal care. Such recommendations could improve both maternal and child health, and, in the long term, help to reduce overweight and obesity in Canadian mothers and their children."

Firefighters train at very high levels to be prepared for the physically demanding tasks that they are required to do on the job. Surprisingly, almost half of their injuries occur during exercise/training, rather than on the fireground, and are due to overexertion, as well as unsafe practices and techniques. Firefighters may be aware of the risks of injury on the fireground, but unaware of the exercise/training risks. The costs of these injuries are high and can lead to early retirement.

This study will accomplish three things. First, we will gain an understanding of why firefighters, despite being relatively healthy, have such high injury rates during training. We will conduct interviews with firefighters to understand their current training practices, techniques and habits. Using qualitative methods, we will identify key areas to address in order to improve the safety of firefighter training. We will also conduct a national survey with our firefighter partners to describe how these themes can be applied to the larger population of firefighters. This will allow us to determine if age, gender, location and the type of firefighting work influence training practices and perceived injury risk. This information will then be integrated with findings from our previous firefighter studies on musculoskeletal injury patterns to create three brief videos addressing injury risk, principles of safe exercise, and best practices in avoiding accidents during training. The videos will be created in consultation with firefighters.

This research should lead to new applicable knowledge that can be shared to increase firefighter injury awareness. Direct benefits to firefighters should include a reduction in injury rates. Indirect effects of this work would reduce the costs of firefighter injury to municipalities and the healthcare system."

Wait time length can be considered an indicator of the overall health of the health care system. Researchers have spent considerable effort to improve the management of waiting lists for elective health care services. However, an area of inquiry that has been largely overlooked in the waiting list literature is the patients' perspective and experience. Statistics Canada gauged the number of Canadians who experienced difficulties getting non-emergency surgery and an estimated 162,000 adults or 10.5% of those who had such surgery reported one or more difficulty. The most commonly cited difficulty was ""waited too long for surgery"". What do patients experience while they wait for surgery, especially those who perceive the wait to be ""too long""? The current research hypothesizes that the impact of waiting has a differential effect for various groups of patients, and that appreciation of the effects of waiting may become an integral part of waiting list management. The study will comprise two research phases and employ both qualitative and quantitative methods. The first phase will be an exploratory examination of the perspectives of patients who are currently on elective surgical wait lists for orthopedic and cardiac surgery. In depth qualitative interviews will be conducted to examine the waiting experience from the patients' perspective. The second phase of the study will build on the findings from the first phase. That is, specific measures of the constructs investigated in phase one will be surveyed in patients about to undergo orthopedic and cardiac surgery after being on a wait list.

Is high-intensity interval training an attractive alternative to continuous aerobic exercise for promoting exercise adherence? Examining the affective response and perceived enjoyment to exercise of varying intensities.,"['Carson, Demian C']",['N/A'],"['Affective Response To Exercise', 'Exercise Adherence', 'Exercise Intensity-Affect Relationship', 'High-Intensity Interval Training', 'Perceived Exercise Enjoyment', 'Perceived Exercise Exertion', 'Psychosocial Determinants Of Health']",4950.0,223291,"Exercise promotes skeletal muscle adaptations that improve health and reduce risk for chronic disease. Traditional exercise strategies focus on continuous exercise, such as walking or cycling for 30-60 minutes. Although continuous exercise is beneficial, adherence to such programs is dismal, with over half of Canadian adults failing to meet physical activity guidelines. Lack of time is the most commonly cited exercise barrier. Low-volume high-intensity interval training (HIT), which involves brief bursts of vigorous exercise separated by periods of rest, has been touted as a time-efficient alternative to continuous exercise. Accumulating evidence indicates that HIT leads to similar beneficial skeletal muscle adaptations as continuous exercise despite a substantially lower time commitment. While the time-saving advantage makes HIT appealing for improving health, vigorous intensity exercise has been shown to be less enjoyable than moderate intensity exercise. Lower enjoyment during exercise is suggested to reduce long-term adherence. However, previous studies examining the relationship between exercise intensity and enjoyment have only compared continuous vigorous intensity exercise to moderate intensity continuous exercise. The rest periods built into HIT may make vigorous exercise more enjoyable and less fatiguing than continuous exercise, but this has yet to be studied. The purpose of this study is to compare feeling states experienced during HIT with moderate and vigorous intensity continuous exercise in sedentary adults. Participants will engage in a single session of HIT, moderate, and vigorous intensity exercise. Enjoyment, fatigue, psychological distress, and perceived effort will be monitored in each bout. Since acute feeling states during exercise are thought to predict long-term adherence, findings will help ascertain whether HIT is an appealing alternative to enhance musculoskeletal health as compared to traditional continuous exercise."

Regular physical activity and minimal sedentary behaviour (e.g., television viewing), during the early years (4 years and younger) is important for healthy growth and development, and preventing chronic diseases. However, only 15% of young Canadian children in the early years are meeting the national guidelines for both behaviours. Parents play key roles in children's socialization and development. Our pilot work indicates parents have important influences on these behaviours, but gaps exist in our understanding of parental influences. Previous work is limited by several factors. The proposed study addresses current gaps and limitations to examine the influence of parental cognitions (e.g., confidence) and behaviours (e.g., support, limits) within a theoretical model of factors predicting objectively measured physical activity and sedentary behaviour among a sample of young children. In partnership with Alberta Health Services, 600 children aged 18 to 24 months and their parents will be recruited from four major immunization clinics in Edmonton, AB. Participating parents will complete a questionnaire. Children's physical activity and sedentary behaviour will be measured objectively with a waist-mounted motion sensor, called an accelerometer, for 7 consecutive days. Several neighbourhood environment variables will be measured using geographic software. Our findings will provide key knowledge in this under-researched segment of the population that will be novel internationally. Furthermore, our findings will uncover modifiable targets for future family-centred interventions and initiatives aiming to establish healthy habits of regular physical activity and minimal sedentary behaviour in young children.

Many children who are obese also have type 2 diabetes and are at risk for other diseases (e.g., heart disease, stroke). Physical inactivity is linked to childhood obesity. However, most research on inactivity has focused on what children are not doing (physical activity). Little research has focused on what they are doing (sedentary behaviour). Sedentary behaviour involves participating in pursuits that require little energy (e.g., TV viewing, video games, computer). It is considered a separate behavior from physical activity. Early research has found that sedentary behaviours are linked with obesity and risk factors for other diseases. However, further research of the relationship is needed because many questions remain. For example: 1) What quantity, types, and patterns of sedentary behavior are most harmful to children's health? 2) Are relationships the same across age groups and genders? 3) What role does physical activity play? Therefore, there are two main objectives of this research project. 1) Examine the association between various sedentary behaviours and disease risk factors among children. 2) Determine if physical activity levels impact these associations. The results from this project will have important implications on the health of Canadian children. Specifically, public health interventions aimed at reducing the risk of obesity and other diseases may need to recommend increasing physical activity as well as decreasing sedentary behaviour."

Evidence is needed on the most important intervention targets and strategies unique to this age group in relevant settings (home, child care, neighbourhood). Such evidence will support achievement of appropriate doses of regular physical activity and minimal sedentary behaviour. The overarching goal of my research program is to effectively promote healthy habits of regular physical activity and minimal sedentary behaviour among children of the early years. Achieving this goal will foster healthy growth and development, life-long active living, and the maintenance of a healthy weight status to prevent chronic diseases. Over the next five years I will address three main research questions in parallel. Answers to these questions will provide the necessary foundation to address my overarching goal. Research Question One: What are the dose-response relationships between physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and important health indicators in the early years? Research Question Two: What are the determinants of physical activity and sedentary behaviour that are unique to the early years in the home and neighbourhood settings? Research Question Three: What role does child care policy play in promoting regular physical activity and minimal sedentary behaviour in the early years?

Supporting healthy physical activity and sedentary behaviour habits in Alberta licensed and approved child care settings through updated accreditation standards,"['Carson, Valerie L']","['Adamo, Kristi B', 'Goldfield, Gary S', 'Kuzik, Nicholas O', 'Ogden, Nancy', 'Okely, Anthony D']","['Accelerometer', 'Accrediation', 'Child Care', 'Legislation', 'Physical Activity', 'Preschoolers', 'Sedentary Behaviour', 'Toddlers']",294332.0,342440,"Regular physical activity and minimal sedentary behaviour, such as television viewing, during the early years (<5 years), is critical for healthy growth and development, reducing obesity, and preventing chronic diseases. However, only 15% of young Canadian children are meeting both the physical activity and sedentary behaviour national guidelines. Government legislation in childcare centres can positively influence physical activity and sedentary behaviour, and promote health in a large proportion of children. The Alberta government has recently a introduced new standard in accredited childcare settings to promote regular physical activity and minimal sedentary behaviour. This study will build on and extend our pilot work. The overall objective is to better understand the immediate physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and health benefits of the new Alberta Child Care Accreditation Program Quality Standards. These standards are being phased in over the next 3 years. A total of 240 children aged 19-60 months from 8 child care centres implementing the new standard and 8 control child care centres in Edmonton and Calgary will be examined. Children's physical activity and sedentary behaviour will be objectively measured with motion sensors for 5 consecutive days at baseline and 6 month follow-up after the new accreditation standard has been implemented. At both time points, children's weights and heights and the physical activity and sedentary behaviour childcare environment will be objectively measured. Additional measures will be obtained via brief parent/guardian and child care director/educator questionnaires. The findings of the proposed research will inform future services, training, and additional resources that will continue to support policy and practice regarding regular physical activity and minimal sedentary behaviour in childcare settings. Alberta will serve as a model where study findings can inform policy and practice changes across Canada."
Early movers: The role of physical activity and sedentary behaviour in the healthy growth and development of infants,"['Carson, Valerie L']","['Hesketh, Kylie', 'Pritchard-Wiart, Lesley']","['Gross Motor Development', 'Infants', 'Physical Activity', 'Prone Position', 'Screen Time', 'Sedentary Behaviour']",59403.0,366243,"The first five years of life are a dramatic period of growth and development. These early years lay the foundation for life-long health. Regular physical activity and minimal sedentary behaviour, such as screen time, strengthens healthy growth and development. I was one of the leaders in developing new Canadian guidelines to support healthy active lifestyles during these first five years. These guidelines will be released in 2017 and include recommendations on physical activity and sedentary behaviour. In developing the guidelines, we found gaps in the information available. For example, we found few long-term studies on young children, especially infants. Few studies looked at how physical activity and sedentary behaviour affect a child's development of motor skills, thinking skills, and social skills. 
My research study will fill these gaps in information. I will examine the long-term associations of physical activity (tummy time) and sedentary behaviour (screen time, reading, carriers, car seats, high chairs, strollers, swings) in infants with their gross motor skills and their achievement of gross motor milestones in the first 18 months of life.
In partnership with Alberta Health Services, 250 parents of infants in Edmonton, Alberta will fill out a questionnaire when their infant is 2, 4, and 6 months old. They will tell us about their infant's physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and gross motor skills. They will also record the gross motor milestones that their infant reaches over the first 18 months of life. A sub-sample of 115 parents will also complete a more detailed questionnaire at 2, 4, and 6 months and their infant's gross motor development will be directly measured at 6 months.
Our findings will fill gaps in knowledge and help update Canada's guidelines with the best information. Findings will also be useful in programs that target physical activity and sedentary behaviour in our youngest Canadians, to support their healthy growth and development."
Adapting the APPLE Schools model to the childcare setting,"['Carson, Valerie L']","['Flynn, Jenn', 'Farmer, Anna P', 'McIsaac, Jessie-Lee D', 'Storey, Kate E']","['Childcare', 'Diet', 'Educators', 'Infants', 'Intervention', 'Physical Activity', 'Preschoolers', 'Sedentary Behaviour', 'Sleep', 'Toddlers']",9987.0,404361,"The first five years of life are a critical period of development that lays the foundation for life-long health. Unfortunately, many young children in Canada are at increased health risk because they are engaging in unhealthy patterns of physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep, and diet. Interventions targeting these health behaviours in the first five years of life have produced mixed results. Similar to school-based health promotion, the childcare setting is optimal for health promotion because it reaches many young children. APPLE Schools is an effective and comprehensive school-based health promotion intervention in Canada. We plan on adapting the APPLE Schools model to the childcare setting to improve health behaviours and health in young children.

The objectives of this planning grant are to: 1) Conduct an environmental scan of existing childcare resources that target health behaviours, 2) Hold a two-day planning meeting with research experts, trainees, and key knowledge users to adapt the main components of the APPLE Schools model to the childcare setting and formulate a grant application, 3) Hold pre-meeting and follow-up meetings with the planning grant team, and 4) Submit a CIHR project grant application.

For the environmental scan, we will conduct a grey literature search for Canadian information and materials targeted at childcare educators and directors to improve health behaviours in young children. The planning meeting will address eight main objectives through a series of presentations and small and large group discussions and activities related to the childcare setting and resources, APPLE Schools intervention components, study methods and procedures, and intervention applicability across Canada. Follow-up meetings will occur with the planning grant team up to the CIHR project grant submission. This planning grant is an important first step in our overall goal of determining how to best promote a healthy start for our youngest Canadians."

Recent advances in technology have resulted in the increased use of mobile screen devices (e.g., tablets, smartphones) during early childhood that didn't exist in previous generations. This exposure has intensified with COVID-19. Research has not kept pace with the technological and cultural changes. Therefore, we lack evidence about how young children's engagement with this new technology impacts their cognitive development. Furthermore, it is unclear if parents can moderate effects.

Utilizing a sample of preschoolers and their parents, this study will address these substantial evidence gaps by examining: 1) screen time patterns, 2) the association between screen time patterns and cognitive development overtime, 3) the differences in quality of parent-child interactions during three sedentary behaviour tasks (i.e., television viewing, game app, storybook reading), and 4) the influence of parent-child interaction quality on the association between screen time patterns and cognitive development.

A total of 360 preschool children at ages 3, 3.5, or 4 years will be recruited and data collection will occur at three time-points over 1 year (baseline, 6 months, 12 months). Screen time patterns (e.g., device, type, content, context) will be measured with an online diary completed by parents daily for 2 weeks. Cognitive development, including memory, impulse control, language, and self-control, will be measured virtually via Zoom. The quality of parent-child interactions will be determined by observing three tasks (i.e., television show, game app, storybook reading) virtually via Zoom. 

The novel findings from this study will help to inform guideline updates, health promotion initiatives, and future interventions targeting healthy development in our youngest Canadians."

Our previous work, in higher socioeconomic status families, found improvements in parental outcomes to promote children's physical literacy development or their ""capacity for a physically active lifestyle"". In partnership with knowledge users, we will examine if the PLAYshop program increases parental confidence, knowledge, and perceived availability of resources to support preschool-aged children's physical literacy development in families of lower socioeconomic status. We will also examine the PLAYshop program implementation. 

We will enroll 130 parents of preschool-aged children (3-5 years) among families classified as low income. The intervention group will receive a virtual workshop, a goody bag of resources/equipment, access to an online toolkit, and booster emails/texts. The waitlist control group will receive the same PLAYshop program at a later date. Parental variables will be measured with baseline and follow-up surveys. We will use statistical tests to determine if these variables are larger at follow-up in the intervention group compared to the control group, taking into account baseline values. We will explore implementation facilitators and barriers using telephone interviews with parents at 2-month follow-up and with workshop leaders at the end of the study. We will identify themes across these interviews.

The PLAYshop program has the potential for meaningful benefits during and post COVID-19. Study findings will be informative for our large network of knowledge users who are interested in supporting the expansion of the PLAYshop program. Additionally, findings will inform future collaborations regarding an adapted PLAYshop program in Indigenous communities."

Gender inequities influence infection and continue to impact women once they are infected, as women living with HIV (WLWH) experience worse HIV clinical outcomes and poorer quality HIV care. Despite a growing emphasis on the importance of women-centred HIV care (WCC) in addressing these inequities, little is known about the effectiveness of this model of care, even though in British Columbia (BC), there exist several examples of holistic HIV care models for women including Oak Tree Clinic, a pioneer in implementing WCC. Building on the foundation of the Canadian HIV Women's Sexual and Reproductive Health Cohort Study (CHIWOS), which has developed a new tool to measure patients' perceptions of WCC, this study aims to document the performance of HIV clinics across BC on the validated WCC tool, to measure the factors associated with use of higher-scoring WCC HIV clinics, and to investigate the longitudinal effect of accessing such clinics on HIV clinical (e.g., virological suppression), sexual (e.g., STI risk behaviours), reproductive (e.g., unplanned pregnancy), and women's health (e.g., pap tests) outcomes among WLWH in BC. We hypothesize that access to higher-scoring WCC HIV clinics will be lowest among Aboriginal women and women with injection drug use or sex work histories, and that women with poorer access to such clinics will have worse health outcomes. This community-collaborative study is enrolling 350 WLWH in BC. Participants complete a peer-administered survey at baseline and 18-months, supported by longitudinal linkage with HIV clinical data in the BC HIV Drug Treatment Program. Through strong community, academic, and policy-maker partnerships, findings will inform the development of evidence-based and gender-focused HIV care models to ameliorate gender inequities and improve health for WLWH across BC and Canada."

Sustaining and growing H4H is only possible if staff and volunteers' well-being and capacity to deliver high quality H/P/C is protected. However, many work-related stressors put these providers at risk for burnout - leading to exhaustion and compromised patient care. An innovative potential solution are mindfulness-informed practices; however, none have been tailored to the unique H4H context. 

As a national, not-for-profit enterprise, Saint Elizabeth (SE) Health Care and the Saint Elizabeth Foundation advocate for and provide equitable access to H/P/C through the H4H Journey Home Hospice in Toronto and Windsor, ON. As part of SE Health, the SE Research Centre was approached by Journey Home Hospice to explore ways of integrating mindfulness-informed practices to support their staff and volunteer well-being.

This project will involve planning for a future research study together with leaders, staff, and volunteers from three Canadian H4H organizations (2 in ON, 1 in NS), and clinician academics who have expertise in mindfulness. Specific objectives are: 1. Identify stressors, challenges, and existing well-being supports within H4H; 2. Identify the most promising mindfulness-based practices for the challenges facing H4Hs; and 3. Co-design a future research study that incorporates mindfulness-based practices to advance the well-being of H4H staff and volunteers across Canada. Project activities include a literature and environmental scan; a survey of H4H staff and volunteers about stressors and supports; and a two-day planning meeting with diverse H4H citizens to explore their lived experiences, and mindfulness-informed practices. The planning grant team will summarize learnings to produce a written report and future study funding outline. Lay summaries with key messages will also be shared with the public."

Since obesity is a multifactorial public health problem, it must be addressed in its biological (individual) context, as well as in its broader social (populational) context.  The ultimate goal of this research project is to determine, at the population level, the factors that are involved in weight change patterns in childhood (from age 5-11 years). Specifically, the research project will study the roles of the social environment and behaviours (diet and physical activity), and their interactions, on weight change and the development of overweight and obesity in Québec primary school children. These children (and their parents) have participated since their birth, and data collection is planned until age 14. Currently, a wealth of data is already available on this cohort including variables reflecting early life, and the pre-school and early primary school years. This research is critical because current weight reduction/maintenance interventions at both the individual and population level have, until now, proven ineffective. In addition, at the population level, data on patterns of body weight development, and physical activity and diet are lacking in children. Results from this project will provide this much needed information to policy and public health researchers and analysts, school administrators, etc., who can use it to effectively formulate and promote evidence-based policies to prevent childhood overweight and obesity."

Epidemiologists use ACES to identify disease outbreaks or other potential public health problems from patterns in hospital activity. While useful for tracking COVID-19, key weaknesses in how the system groups patients were found. This project proposes to improve the way the system groups patients by using state-of-the-art computational methods (machine learning and natural language processing) that do not rely on one rigid model only, and that can better classify key pieces of information from the chief complaint. Diverse experts in epidemiology, public health, medicine, and computer science will collaborate to determine how best to define new health conditions, based on these classifications and other available patient information. The ACES system will be updated so that it automatically uses and displays these new health condition groupings, which will compliment those that are already there. These new health condition definitions will make ACES more flexible and relevant, providing public health leaders with an effective tool to better detect and monitor public health threats like opioid consumption issues and new diseases like COVID-19."

Many people who are aging with physical impairments often experience additional chronic conditions. These chronic conditions or complications from their impairment can lead to increased health care use and unmet health care needs. The unmet health care needs can be due to several factors, including: lack of physician knowledge about their impairments, additional health problems, worsening health, and lack of a holistic, multidisciplinary approach to health care. As a result many people who are aging with long-term physical impairments have learned to adapt and manage their own health. My research uses a life course perspective to understand the way 18 people with permanent impairments have learned to self-manage their health and health care experiences. Data were gathered through in-depth, semi-structured interviews. 
Many of the participants wished they could have access to publically funded physiotherapy, massage therapy, and chiropractic services. These services are needed throughout their life because they often have complex needs resulting from additional chronic conditions or health problems as they age. Access to alternative health care was especially important for the participants who have work-related impairments. These types of services might improve the quality of life for people with work-related impairments as they age and may help them to continue working. 
I will conclude with offering suggestions for improvements in the health care system, health policies, and in Workers Compensation Boards that will better meet the needs of people aging with physical impairments. My research will also provide helpful tips for people who are aging with physical impairments as they age and navigate the health care system."

The ways the mind, body and spirit react to trauma have been linked to negative health outcomes for people who use drugs, but traditional resources are known to help manage these challenges. There is a shortage of research in Canada that looks at complex trauma in urban Indigenous young people who use drugs, and positive action interventions that are built with culture. My research will support a land-based positive action intervention that is connected to culture and focused on healing complex trauma experienced by urban Indigenous young people who use drugs.

Many have a mix of incomes and a mix of renters and owners (good ""social mix"") and these different types of residents interact with each other and keep the neighbourhood vibrant and friendly.   Some research shows that these qualities - - the physical environment and social mix -- can improve the mental health of residents, especially symptoms like anxiety and depression.  But no Canadian study has ever followed a neighbourhood through a redevelopment, and compared before and after measurements to explore how much and why the mental health of its residents may change.  By understanding this, we can ensure that future developments in our cities and towns are well-guided, cost-effective, and truly result in better neighbourhoods that are invigorated, inviting and healthy for Canadians.

This study will follow Toronto's largest inner city social housing development, Regent Park, through an intense renovation that will create a new physical structure, more accessible services and businesses, and for the first time, a mix of residential units (social housing, market rent, and owned).  Existing residents will move to temporary housing before returning once the redevelopment of their area is complete, and we will ask this group to complete questionnaires to assess their mental health once they move back in, and then again 12 months later.  At each time, their results will be compared against those of residents whose areas have not yet been redeveloped.  To study how ""social mix"" is occurring, we will use GIS and other tools to measure travel behaviours of residents in their new neighbourhood, and we will also measure how residents rate the new physical improvements to determine impact of different physical changes.  Finally, we will use statistical tools to look for the effect of age, gender and ethnicity in their responses as well."

This randomized control trial will 1) evaluate the efficacy of a brief (10 session) parent- and social-skills training intervention targeting two robust common risk factors shared amongst EDs - impulsivity and poor parenting - in the prevention of EDs, and 2) determine for whom interventions are most effective, how and through what mechanisms. For this, a subsample of 250 children aged 4 and 5 years from a large pregnancy study, the 3D study, will be recruited, with 125 of these randomized to receive an intervention. The subsample will be selected based on impulsivity scores at 2 years, and will be assessed 7 times: baseline (pre-test), 2 and 8 months post-intervention, and then every 6 months for 2 years. 3D study collected data across pregnancy and the first two years of the child's life of 1594 mothers and their children and offers a rich data on important gestational information, individual (temperament and behaviours), parental, demographic, and other environmental characteristics; variables that will be used to identify for whom the preventative intervention has beneficial effects and for whom it does not. This study provides a unique opportunity to determine whether a brief, cost-effective intervention delivered in pre-school targeting common risk factors can prevent a range of EDs and related problems, so costly to society. It could also provide a better understanding of how individual and environmental factors work together in the development of EDs across early childhood."

These associations may be impacted by aspects related to sexual and gender identity, including bullying and discrimination, community and social support, and access to services. As such, the association between cannabis use and mental health in SGDY is likely to be complex and requires careful examination to better understand the nature and directionality of association and how to better support this population. This research will use a mixed-methods (qualitative and quantitative) approach to explore these associations in SGDY and provide community-informed avenues for the examination of explanatory mechanisms in the link between cannabis use and mental health challenges, as well as key gaps in services and resources for SGDY."

This is worrying as some studies have shown that CU during adolescence is associated with higher risk for adult cannabis and other substance use disorders. However, it is still unclear whether starting CU earlier in adolescence puts youth at higher risk of developing later substance use problems after accounting for early risk factors or different patterns of substance use. We also don't know what individual and environmental factors place boys and girls who initiate cannabis use during adolescence at higher risk of developing later substance use problems. Thus, the present project aims to examine (1) whether the association between CU initiation and later substance use problems remain when considering important environmental and individual factors; (2) whether the association between early CU initiation and later substance use problems can be explained by CU profiles (how much one uses, how frequently, etc.) and individual and environmental characteristics, and (3) whether the effect between age of initiation and later substance use problems differ for different CU profiles, and individual and environmental factors. For this, we will build on two ongoing longitudinal studies, in which participants were followed from age 5 months to 18/19 years, and we will collect detailed information on their cannabis use and other substance use, mental health, and the youth's environment at 23 and 25 years. This study could provide much needed information about how individual and environmental factors work together to increase the risk of developing substance use problems, potentially helping guide policy and prevention for those more likely to develop substance use problems by early adulthood."

Early or heavy cannabis use (CU) has been linked to poorer brain functioning, which can persist beyond acute cannabis intoxication. In turn, this poorer brain functioning has been linked to worse outcomes including poorer academic performance and work capacity. However, previous studies are limited, with very few of these following participants repeatedly across development and taking important factors into account (e.g., different modes/profiles of CU, polysubstance use, key school and demographic factors). Thus, we still do not know whether youth with certain cognitive profiles are at increased risk of CU or whether youth CU leads to poorer brain function. Clarifying this developmental sequence will allow for the identification of youth most at risk of CU and neurocognitive problems, which will in turn help to better inform policy, treatment, and prevention programs. This study will benefit from 25+ years of data collected from two  birth cohorts of the Québec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (N=240 born in 1996/7 and N=1500 born 1997/8), to examine associations between CU and brain function across youth, a key population identified as a priority research area by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

Finally, the current study will also bridge gaps in knowledge translation by developing and disseminating engaging psychoeducational materials."

Scientific discoveries have been critical to understanding the onset and normative progression of puberty, its hormonal underpinnings, and its association with mental health (MH) in youth. However, despite this very promising research, puberty is recognized only very generally in public health and prevention programs, and is rarely considered in the identification of children most at risk and in program delivery. This may be due in part to the complexity of measuring pubertal development and all its components and the fact that certain aspects of pubertal development are still not well understood, especially in boys. 
To address this, we began to measure the puberty and social environment of children that had been followed since birth in the context of a large pregnancy cohort study (3D study). This new study aims to further measure these children's puberty, hormones, key psychosocial and social environment factors, and mental health into adolescence, a key period for the development of mental health. We can then use our data to identify which pubertal profiles and social environment characteristics are important to youth's mental health and test whether puberty and these psychosocial and social environment factors interact to increase or reduce MH problems. This will then guide how, when and for whom to aim prevention."

These policy documents guide our understanding of ethically responsible research. In essence, research without engaging Aboriginal peoples, their ontologies and epistemologies, simply will not improve the health of Aboriginal Canadians. At issue are the institutional barriers that exist, creating ethical tensions for scholars seeking to do community-based research 'in a good way'. As health researchers attempt to undertake respectful and relevant projects using community-based participatory methodologies, they and their Aboriginal community partners are experiencing the benefits associated with this approach; they are also experiencing the challenges. Debates about what constitutes 'ethically sound' Aboriginal health research in theory versus practice are now beginning to surface. We need to clarify and minimize the ethical tensions and institutional barriers that exist, which, on balance, detract researchers from engaging in Aboriginal health research 'in a good way'. We also need to align institutional ethics with community ethics, doing so will ultimately improve the health outcomes of Aboriginal Canadians. As such, the question guiding this research seeks to understand how health researchers currently navigate/compromise their academic/community environments when carrying out community-based participatory Aboriginal health research."

In the 1960s, amidst other resource extraction and industrial development initiatives, in an area characterized by economic disparities, a pulp and paper mill began dumping pollutants into Boat Harbour; it continues to do so today albeit with increasingly sophisticated treatment practices. Despite these pollution checks and controls, Boat Harbour has become a dumping ground for toxic waste, a place of fear and unrest, embroiled in political, legal and economic tension, and rife with environmental health concerns for members of the First Nation and for others living throughout Pictou County.

Despite decades of biomedical research, their health outcomes have seen little improvement, largely because researchers have focused on pathology and dysfunction, not on understanding the social determinants of health or Indigenous experiences. For example, only recently have we recognized that the health of their land is intimately tied to the health of Indigenous peoples. We also know that industry is degrading the environment and impacting human health to such an extent and at such a rate that there is cause for serious concern. Worse, disproportionate exposures to pollutants are impacting Indigenous peoples, especially given their close proximity to and interdependent relationship on the land around them. We have a reasonable understanding of the historical, cultural, and epidemiological perspectives concerning Indigenous health in Canada. But we do not have an adequate understanding of their health concerns, changes to their health status over time, or the factors that contribute to their health status from their perspectives. 

Community-based participatory research is a philosophical and methodological approach that characterizes the traits that CIHR's Institute of Aboriginal Peoples' Health espouses: ""to carry out sound and ethical research together in ways that respect community values and allow communities to stand as true partners in the research process"". By integrating Indigenous and Western scientific approaches in community-based participatory research - exemplified in the accompanying (funded) operating grant - this research program, unified by a number of interrelated and complementary projects, will offer recommendations for practice, program and policy domains that will ultimately reduce health disparities and work towards health equity by involving Indigenous peoples in Canada in the research enterprise."

The goal of this Dissemination Event (DE) Grant is to maximize the impact of our research activities by augmenting and expanding end-of-grant KT strategies and audiences to a national level. We aim to meet this goal by engaging in face-to-face cross-site (Alberta, Manitoba, and Nova Scotia) KT strategies. Specifically, we aim to undertake several activities, outlined as five key objectives: 1) Collectively compare and synthesize data from the three sites to identify similarities and differences in asthma and allergy support needs and innovation in intervention preferences between sites; 2) Identify key 'talking points' designed specifically for relevant government agencies, Aboriginal health organizations, and the research community; 3) Determine future research and intervention priorities concerning asthma and allergies involving Aboriginal peoples in Canada; 4) Create community-relevant KT products including a plain language summary report, poster, and YouTube story of the cross-site analysis for dissemination to community partners; 5) Prepare and submit open-access manuscripts based on cross-site comparative analyses. We anticipate that these DE activities will have a direct positive impact on personal and population health by improving community and individual-level support and education for Aboriginal families across Canada affected by asthma and allergies. Our proposed knowledge sharing strategy is also positioned to provide valuable guidance to policy makers working to improve health delivery systems (e.g. school boards, health centers, Aboriginal leaders)."

Our research goal is to bring to light new and restored understandings of integrative health.

Indigenous peoples have adapted to local environments for millennia. Place-based knowledge systems, embedded in and communicated through language (especially stories), situate Indigenous peoples in a deep understanding of the interconnectedness and interdependence with the natural world. While the link between a healthy natural world and healthy people is only beginning to be detailed and modeled in dominant (Western) scientific discourse, it has been known, embodied, and taught through stories in Indigenous contexts for hundreds of generations. We are created from four energies - Earth, Water, Fire, and Air - and without these, we cease to exist.

And now, the defining issue of our times is anthropogenic climate change. It is Mother Earth's response to our misguided attempts to colonize her. Climate change is a real-world 'wicked' problem that requires horizontal and vertical intersectoral and multi-jurisdictional responses from local to international scales. But these responses cannot come from the stories of Western science alone. We need to put them together with other stories to help us acknowledge, understand, and most importantly, reconcile the damage we have done.

Our research premise: Renewable energy development could be a platform for putting reconciliation at the heart of decision-making and implementation. We will examine how Indigenous knowledge systems - as applied to intersectoral partnerships for renewable energy development - have the potential to lead us towards new and restored understandings for integrative health by reconciling and healing our relations with each other as well as the land, air, and water around us."

This research program postulates that systemic inflammation may be prevented if adaptive self-regulation processes (i.e., self-protection and goal adjustment) foster effective life-style behaviors such as physical activity (PA). This process may occur because self-protection and goal adjustment can reduce distress and foster new and adpative behaviors. The first objective of this study is to examine whether PA reduces wide spread inflammation among BCS. Given PAs health benefits and low rates of activity among BCS, the studys second objective is to determine the role of adaptive self-regulation (e.g., finding something positive in otherwise negative situations or being able to disengage from unattainable goals and reengage in new ones) in enhancing PA and reducing inflammation over time. These objectives will be perused by using an existing ongoing database comprised of a large sample of BCS who were followed over 15 months. This novel and feasible research program provides a foundation for new integrated psychosocial health research to inform intervention programs aimed at reducing burden and decreased health problems among BCS."
Neurobiology of Social Affiliation and Aggressive Behaviour in Adolescence,"['Catherine, Nicole L']",['N/A'],"['Adolescent Development', 'Aggression', 'Gender', 'Intervention Programs', 'Longitudinal Data Modelling', 'Neuropeptides', 'Oxytocin', 'Risk And Resiliency', 'Salivary Biomarkers', 'Social Affiliation']",90000.0,203189,"How do relationships with friends and families influence adolescents who are at risk for violent and aggressive behaviours? What are the biological mechanisms by which social relationships 'get under the skin' to promote adolescent well-being? How do these mechanisms differ for boys and girls? These are just some of the questions that this research program will address. 
Youth displaying violent, aggressive behaviours are at risk for a multitude of social, emotional, and mental health problems that forecast criminal behaviours, and adjustment difficulties in adulthood. The high cost of mental health and forensic services associated with youth violence incites a call for an investment in research in effective intervention programs. Clearly, it is important that these programs be informed by research on risk and protective factors specific to girls and boys.
Research suggests that the majority of violence among girls occurs in the context of close relationships with romantic partners and family members. To explore this further, our first goal of this research is to follow a group of high-risk girls and boys from early adolescence to adulthood to explore further the significance of social relationships with friends, romantic partners, and parents in predicting health and well-being. 
Research in the biology of social relationships suggests that when youth experience positive social relationships, brain chemicals such as oxytocin are released that may lower stress and create feelings of trust, thus decreasing aggression. These brain chemicals may be different for girls and boys. Therefore, our second goal is to measure brain chemicals found in saliva in high-risk girls and boys participating in an intervention program designed to strengthen social relationships and decrease aggression. The empirical investigation of the interface between biology and social relationships will inform the development of interventions that will foster adolescent health and well-being.

Commercial Actors and Patient Group Influence on Health Policy Decisions Regarding the Public Funding of In Vitro Fertilization: A Cross Provincial Study,"['Cattapan, Alana R']",['N/A'],"['Assisted Human Reproduction', 'Economical And Political Impacts Of Innovations', 'Health Policy', 'Interest Groups And Lobbying', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reproduction And Infertility', 'Social']",90000.0,319312,"In 2014, Ontario and New Brunswick announced new public funding for in vitro fertilization (IVF) These new initiatives have been attributed, in part, to the work of highly mobilized interest groups advocating for the  establishment of public funding for IVF, and the highly successful lobbying and social media campaigns that they have mounted.

The efforts of these groups to make IVF more accessible are laudable, however, there are important conflicts of interest apparent in the  relationships between patient groups and commercial actors (fertility clinics and pharmaceutical firms) that will profit from expanded access to IVF. These relationships are not inherently problematic-there are clear benefits for patient groups in accepting industry funding-however, relevant scholarship suggests that the autonomy and integrity of patient groups may be compromised by financial relationships with commercial actors. 

My project draws on extensive documentary research and interviews with key actors to address the ways that patient groups advocating for the public funding of IVF are impacted by their financial relationships with commercial actors, as well as the consequences for health policy making on IVF funding in the provinces. By examining the ways that funding initiatives were developed in Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, and New Brunswick, as well as the ongoing advocacy to establish funding in other provinces, I will identify how the relationships with commercial actors have influenced the work of patient groups advocating for the public funding of IVF, as well as what the outcomes of that advocacy have been. Overall, I will identify the role of commercial actors in the advocacy of patient groups campaigning for the public funding of IVF, and the outcomes for provincial health policy."

We propose conducting research into COVID-19 misinformation from multiple angles, developing effective communication and education tools, countering misinformation strategically, and providing policy recommendations to deal with COVID-19 and future outbreaks.  Our interdisciplinary team of experts is led by Timothy Caulfield, Canada Research Chair and Health Law Institute Research Director, who has been studying health and science misinformation for over 20 years. Our team will conduct systematic content analyses of traditional and online social media and empirical psychological research on how individuals respond to COVID-19 information.  The objective is to assemble and execute a depth-of-analysis sufficient to enact positive outcomes for COVID-19 while establishing a blueprint for future misinformation events. The impact of this course of research will be significant, enabling the development of strategies to combat misinformation, stigma, and fear, to address their underlying drivers, and to improve public awareness, knowledge, and trust. We will meet the call's objectives of contributing to the global response to the COVID-19 outbreak, strengthening the understanding of its public impacts, and providing evidence to inform public health planning, decision making and response.

Due to close connections and dependence on the land, they often directly experience the negative health consequences caused by environmental contamination, unsustainable corporate practices, and corrupt and militarized control of resources. In Canada and Guatemala, a key concern has been that of inadequate consultation with  indigenous persons, or of a democratic process generally, in decisions regarding the use of resources for corporate extraction. Particularly among Ardoch Algonquin (Ontario, Canada) and Mayan Sipakapense (San Marcos, Guatemala) communities, lack of an adequate consultation process in establishing recent mining operations has endangered the health of these communities. In response, these communities have demonstrated a variety of strategies of resistance. Key to this resistance has been a belief in the right to self-determination. The purpose of this research is to understand the role of self-determination in promoting health among these indigenous communities. It is believed that further understanding of this community value in the context of undemocratic mining practices, will provide important implications for ethical public health policy and community-centred practice."

To date, much research has focused on describing and measuring the burden carried by family members caring for a relative with dementia. At the same time, efforts to reduce or relieve the burden of care are recognized to be inadequate. This project responds to this situation of increasing care needs, constrained resources and insufficient support for families by focusing attention on learning about the ways families make arrangements, mobilize resources and access formal supports to make life as good as it can be. The aim of this research is to 1) develop better understanding of how people are managing their lives so that we can know better how to help them and 2) compare the situation in Canada with practices in other countries so that we can learn from each other what works."

Universal health coverage and social inequalities in health: Understanding the impact of barriers and restrictions to health insurance coverage,"['Cerigo, Helen E']",['N/A'],"['Health Care Access', 'Health Inequality', 'Health Systems', 'International Comparison', 'Policy', 'Private Insurance', 'Social Determinants Of Health', 'Social Epidemiology', 'Universal Health Coverage', 'Unmet Needs']",105000.0,347966,"In Canada and elsewhere, the struggle to fund escalating public health costs has put pressure on governments to find alternatives to the current, predominantly public, financing structures. One such alternative has been to turn to private funding of health care through out-of-pocket spending by individuals and the development of private health insurance markets. For instance, in Canada between 1988 and 2004, private spending increased from 25% to 30% of total health expenditures and the proportion accounted for by private health insurance nearly doubled (from 7 to 13%). Both out-of-pocket spending and private health insurance may create barriers to health coverage and care. The shift to private funding has the potential to create or increase social inequalities in health. For example, those of lower socioeconomic status may be more likely to forgo needed care due to income related barriers (e.g., co-payments). However, there has been limited international comparative evidence on the effect of changing financing structures on social inequalities in health. 

The goal of my doctoral research is to determine the impact of health insurance coverage arrangements and regulations on social inequalities in health among developed countries with universal health coverage (Canada, Germany, France, United Kingdom and Australia) between 2001 and 2013. Across these countries there are large variations in the implementation of universal health coverage in terms of public financing, cost sharing, benefit packages and regulations on private spending. I will determine if these variations impact health status and health care access differentially across income groups. This research will inform and feed the current debate on the future of health care and the role of the private sector in these changes. Policy-makers will use this research to guide to the development of public spending restraint tools that do not have differential impacts across various social and economic groups."

The model will build on the current cultural continuity literature, be grounded in Indigenous knowledges of physical health and activity (e.g. ceremonial practices, land-based healing, harvesting of foods and resources) and engage Elders and knowledge keepers to pass on traditions that reflect the context and histories of Indigenous participants. Cultural activities will be offered on campus targeting ceremonial and land-based physical activity, food and health. Indigenous Elders and knowledge keepers will be invited to share teachings about traditional foods and physical health and activity to Indigenous participants.  We will use Indigenous methodologies including the conversation method to understand how connecting participants to cultural or ceremonial practices and teachings regarding physical activity, health and food impact the wellbeing of our Indigenous student population and their families. The results of this research will contribute new knowledge on the relationships between cultural continuity, physical activity, food and health among Indigenous Peoples.

Black and racialized migrant women and their children are at a heightened risk of GBV, and this is partly linked to their exposure to precarious employment (PE) opportunities available to them. PE is characterized by work that is poorly paid, lack protection, and insecure and associated with poor working conditions- amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. Although PE is receiving increased attention from researchers and policy makers, its complex relationships with GBV, as experienced by black and racialized migrant women, remains under-researched.  This study seeks to examine the complex relationship between GBV and PE, and its impacts on black and racialized migrant women and their children in Canada. This study will focus on experiences of black and racialized migrant women (and their children) in PE who may be exposed or at risk of GBV, and will also include the perspectives of health and non-health service providers who serve this population group. Understanding these connections is essential in policy and practice given that black and racialized migrant women and their children face multiple layers of discrimination compounded by intersecting social variables such as race, gender, immigration status and language which compromise their health and wellbeing. Policy development and implementation  that reject a ""one-size-fits all"" approach and adopts an intersectional lens in crafting intervention initiatives is key in improving the health and wellbeing of black and racialized migrant women and their children in Canada and globally."

We address this gap in knowledge by using machine learning methods including methods capable of learning from multiple data sources.
Methods: We will extend our development of machine learning approaches to identify predictors of vaping onset and dependence. Data will be included from multiple longitudinal cohort studies that assess vaping.  Person-level characteristics will be explored as candidate predictors. The purpose of this study is (1)To identify and rank the importance of characteristics that are predictive of vaping onset and dependence using a machine learning model within multiple datasets. Using this model, we will also assess the probability of effects that vary across subgroups (age, sex/gender, race);(2) To assess how differences in effects between surveys (population, geographies, measures) impact the predictors of vaping onset and dependence; (3) To implement and further develop integrative data analysis procedures to allow for machine learning across multiple studies with increased power.
Impact: Findings from this study will help inform current public health debates on e-cigarette use and guide policy and clinical interventions. This study will be an important endeavor and first of its kind in the application of machine learning and integrative data analysis to vaping, which will pave the way for future use of this analytical technique in this field."

Lebanese people constitute the largest sub-group of Arabic-speaking peoples, and as of 2001, they were the sixth-largest non-European ethnic group. The family is the central unit in Lebanese society and is therefore fundamental for creating social connectedness among Lebanese older adults in Canada. However, two decades of war, sporadic bouts of violence, and political and economic instability in Lebanon have instilled a sense of fear, anxiety, and insecurity in the Lebanese people, which shape their aging process both at home and in the diaspora. As such, unlike their Canadian-born counterparts, Lebanese immigrants grow old while navigating an intersecting web of cultural and psychosocial circumstances that impose various stressors on themselves and their family caregivers. I will investigate how universalized western ideas of ""healthy active aging"" suit the Lebanese Canadian community. I will draw attention to promising practices that can inform age-friendly initiatives to address meaning, belonging, and inclusiveness. I will explore the dynamic processes of immigration, aging, age-related cultural transitions, how social contexts shape aging, cultural meanings, and how time and place shape the aging process among Lebanese Canadian older adults.
Additionally, I will explicitly investigate how trauma connects to the aging process and influences the development of meaning and connectedness among Lebanese Canadian older adults. I will conduct interviews with older adults to gauge their conception of aging and how their traumatic experience influence their worldview and construction of meaning. Surveys of program staff, users and family caregivers will be conducted at Lebanese community organizations that provide social supports and services for older adults."
Improving Patient Care for Rare Diseases One Blood Spot at a Time: Chloe's Story,"['Chakraborty, Pranesh K']",['N/A'],"['Biochemistry', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Newborn Screening', 'Patient Care', 'Public Health', 'Tyrosinemia Type I']",750.0,395703,"Chloe was born with a rare, genetic condition called tyrosinemia type 1. This means that she cannot breakdown proteins from food, specifically the amino acid tyrosine, which causes a buildup of a chemical called succinylacetone (SUAC) in the body. High levels of SUAC can damage the liver and kidneys, so Chloe needs to take medication and eat a special diet to bring her SUAC level down to normal (close to zero).  With this treatment, Chloe will grow up to be as smart and healthy as other children her age. To make sure her medication and diet are working properly, doctors have to check her blood often. This means she would spend a lot of time going to the hospital for blood work. Researchers at Newborn Screening Ontario (NSO) wanted to find a way to make Chloe's life better. 

NSO is the provincial program that coordinates newborn screening for babies born in Ontario by collecting a small blood sample (a dried blood spot) after birth to screen for more than 25 rare, but treatable diseases. After screening, the samples are stored and can be used to improve the program and develop new tests, perform quality control measures, and generate new knowledge about rare diseases through research. If parents are not OK with their sample being used for these purposes, they can ask NSO to destroy their sample.  The stored dried blood spots helped researchers at NSO develop a test that can accurately measure SUAC levels from the dried blood spot. This means that Chloe can take a blood sample at home through a finger prick and send her sample in the mail to NSO for doctors to monitor her blood. Chloe is able to spend more of her childhood playing and exploring, and less time travelling to and waiting in hospitals."
The Health of Caregivers of Children with Behavior Problems: A Longitudinal Analysis,"['Chalifoux, Mathieu']",['N/A'],"['Caregiver Health', 'Growth Curve Modelling', 'Physical Health', 'Psychological Health', 'Survey', 'Systematic Review']",17500.0,253389,"Recent developments in research have proposed that caregivers of children with health problems tend to have more health problems themselves compared to caregivers of healthy children. This could be due to many things, such as: increase of costs associated with care, bigger time demands, stress associated with caregiving, etc. However, there is variability between studies and how caregivers cope. More work is needed to understand what causes this caregiver health effect. Evidence suggests that external behavior problems might affect caregivers more. There are two goals to this study. First, since results have demonstrated some variability, we will conduct a review of all the research to understand how caregiver health is affected under different circumstances and to generate hypotheses about what can cause the health effect. Second, we will look at three different types of children with health problems (physical, internal behavior problem, external behavior problem) and compare them to healthy children in order to determine the contribution of external behavioral problems to the health of the caregiver over time. The systematic review will have two main steps. First, to identify all studies containing the two outcomes that is of interest to us (physical health and mental health). Second, we will compare results on these outcomes across studies. This will permit us to determine which circumstances affect caregivers in which way. This step will be used to generate hypotheses. The analysis of the effect of external behavior over time will be done on a nationally representative survey provided by Statistics Canada. This is the first study to rigorously summarize literature on caregiver health. It is also the first study to examine the impact of various child behavior problems on caregiver physical and psychological health using population based longitudinal data."

It Doesn't Have to Hurt: A Science-Media Partnership to Mobilize Evidence about Children's Pain to Parents,"['Ehm, Erica', 'Chambers, Christine T']","['Barwick, Melanie A', 'Bender, Jacqueline L', 'Campbell-Yeo, Marsha L', 'Collier, George', 'Goldman, Ran D', 'Mogil, Jeffrey S', ""O'Hara, Kathryn E"", 'Stevens, Bonnie J', 'Stinson, Jennifer N', 'Taddio, Anna', 'Witteman, Holly M']","['Community Engagement', 'Evaluation', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Media', 'Pain', 'Parents', 'Pediatric Pain', 'Research Evidence Mobilization', 'Science-Media Partnership', 'Social Media']",200000.0,316539,"Background.Poorly managed pain in children is a serious and on-going health problem, resulting in unnecessary suffering and long-term negative effects. Knowledge to action gaps in managing children’s acute and chronic pain are well documented; yet knowledge translation (KT) efforts have primarily targeted health professionals, not parents. Parents are key knowledge users of evidence about children’s pain, and are increasingly turning to social media for information about child health.Objectives. The grant seeks to increase parent uptake and application of evidence-based knowledge on children’s pain via a science-media partnership between health researchers and an award-winning online publisher targeted primarily to Canadian mothers, the YummyMummyClub.ca (YMC). YMC has an online monthly reach of over 5 million people. The research team (led by C. Chambers) and YMC (led by E. Ehm) will develop, implement, and evaluate an integrated social media campaign called “It Doesn’t Have to Hurt”, to raise parents’ (primarily mothers’) awareness about children’s pain. The partnership will capitalize on YMC’s well-established reach and engagement via their website, social media (e.g., Facebook, Twitter), and community network of bloggers, as well as the expertise of the research team. Specific objectives are to: 1) document the reach of the campaign (e.g., number of content views); 2) evaluate the impact of the campaign on parent knowledge and behaviour to prevent and minimize children’s pain via online surveys and interviews; 3) track posts (e.g., number, content) about children’s pain over social media using “social listening” before, during, and after the campaign; and 4) evaluate the effectiveness of the science-media partnership in meeting stakeholder (i.e., parent, researcher, YMC, community organization, funding partner) goals and needs.Methods.The “It Doesn’t Have to Hurt” campaign will span a 12-month period of targeted dissemination and discussion of content about children’s pain via blogs, videos, Twitter parties, Facebook polls, and social media images, all posted and promoted on the YMC website and social media.Evaluation.A mixed methods utilization-focused evaluation approach will be used.Expected Results.It is expected that the campaign will generate: 1) a very high reach (~17 million content views based on YMC benchmarks); 2) improved parent pain-related knowledge and behaviour; 3) an increase in number of social media posts about children’s pain with improved evidence-based content; and 4) effectiveness of the science-media partnership in meeting stakeholder goals and needs.Team & Stakeholders. Internationally known researchers with extensive expertise in pain, children’s health, KT, e-health, and communications will partner with YMC, a parent panel, community organizations (Canadian Association of Pediatric Health Centres of Canada; CAPHC; Canadian Pain Coalition; CPC), and funding partners (Nova Scotia Health Research Foundation; NSHRF).KT.Both integrated (e.g., co-development, launch event) and end-of-grant (e.g., presentations, publications) strategies are proposed.Significance. This work will bridge a critical knowledge to action gap in children’s pain. It also will increase our understanding of KT via a novel science-media partnership. This partnership has strong potential as an approach for mobilizing evidence to the public, and could be applied to other areas of children’s health and health more generally."

Tess was in the hospital for 82 days and had to go through numerous intrusive, and sometimes painful, procedures-up to 10 a day. During her hospital stay, the nurses and doctors taught Jack 3 evidence-based techniques (breastfeeding, sucrose, skin-to-skin) to reduce her baby's pain, which Jack shares in this video to inspire parents to use these strategies with all babies, not just those who were born prematurely. The video is highly relevant to IHDCYH's mandate to improve knowledge translation and help demonstrate the value of reproductive, child and youth health research in Canada."

Validation of instruments for use in clinical trials assessing the impact of modified textured food in long term and complex continuing care.,"['Chambers, Larry W', 'Keller, Heather H']","['Caissie, Danielle', 'Carreau, Louise J', 'Duizer, Lisa M', 'Fergusson, Dean A', 'Lemire, Nicole', 'Trainor, Andrea']","['Food Satisfaction', 'Instrument', 'Modified-Texture Food', 'Nutrition', 'Older Adults', 'Validation']",50000.0,191601,"Many diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or conditions such as dementia and stroke, can lead to swallowing difficulties. Often people with swallowing disorders must eat pureed or minced textured foods to eat safely. However, the process of pureeing or mincing greatly reduces the food's appeal and often degrades its nutritional quality. This can lead to reduced food satisfaction, decreased food intake and weight loss.  New modified-texture food products are being developed for people with swallowing disorders. These foods are not only safe and easy to swallow but also, the production processes aim to maintain flavour and nutritional quality. Planning for a clinical trial that will assess the impact of modified-texture food products on older adults requiring pureed or minced diets living in continuing care facilities is underway. We propose this validation study to assess if the measures used will accurately measure the impact of different modified-texture food products. Study participants will be cognitively well patients/residents on oral diets at Saint-Vincent Hospital in Ottawa, Ontario who are experiencing declining health as indicated by an InterRAI Minimum Dataset - Changes in Health, End-stage disease and Symptoms and Signs (CHESS) score of two to four. A 33-item Mealtime Satisfaction Questionnaire will be assessed at two points in time, three months apart. A 5-point Sensory Preference Scale will also be assessed for its ability to discriminate between liked and disliked foods, and response to change over time. The validation study will also develop a photographic method of food intake assessment using the Comstock Visual Method of measuring food waste. Results from this validation study will provide important information to help in questionnaire and scale refinement, sample size calculations and identify any methodology issues in preparation for clinical trials of modified-texture foods."

The proposed forums will disseminate and exchange knowledge deriving from the Because She Cares study, which used culturally-integrated performance narrative methods to gather, interpret and share ACB women's narratives of HIV-related employment as caring work. While HIV-related employment can offer care benefits - realize rights of HIV engagement, address HIV stigma/discrimination, foster social inclusion, connect PHAs to health services, and engender altruistic health benefits - it can also be deleterious to self-care. Concerns about HIV disclosure through one's employment, intersectional stigma and discrimination, employment precarity or under-employment, balancing other local and transnational working roles, and its emotional toll can negatively impact the quality of life of ACB women living with HIV. Given the multifaceted issues that can impact the well-being of ACB women living with HIV - as women, racialized people, immigrants, and people living with HIV - AASO employers and the ACB community desire evidenced-based discussions around the unique needs of ACB immigrant women that shape their employment experiences in AASOs. KT aims are to disseminated and exchange findings from the Because She Cares study, promote culturally-integrated performance-based KT (i.e., spoken word performance, a poetry anthology, post-performance ""kitchen talks""), and generate discussions about HIV-related employment and self-care amongst key stakeholders to better assure it is meaningful, healthful, and care-full work for ACB women living with HIV."

World-renowned cancer research organizations have reported that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption or cigarette smoking that does not increase the risk of developing cancer. Gender minority (GM) people- people that have a gender identity that is different from their sex assigned at birth such as transgender men or transgender women- have a higher risk of developing cancer because studies outside of Canada have demonstrated that this community has higher rates of substance use. Data on Canadian GMs is limited as many surveys do not include a question that asks participants about their gender identity. In my research, I will be using two Canadian datasets that have recently collected information regarding the gender identity of their participants, and I will use this information to explore the rates of alcohol consumption, tobacco use and related-cancers in GM people. I will also use this data to determine how the rates of alcohol consumption and tobacco use has changed in GM communities since the COVID-19 pandemic.  
I will help explain the results of this data by learning from GM people themselves, through the use of focus groups. This research will uncover the rates of alcohol and tobacco use in the Canadian GM community and help researchers understand what factors contribute to the use of these two substances in this community for policy development."

The infiltration of fat (adipose tissue) into skeletal muscle is a reason for muscle weakness and poor functional mobility. The objective of this study is to determine the relationship between changes over 2 years in the amount of fat within muscle in older adults with and without type 2 diabetes, and determine if changes in the amount of fat within the muscle is related to changes in mobility and strength. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans will be used to analyze the amount of fat within the lower leg muscles at baseline and follow-up (2 years). We hypothesize that women with diabetes will experience more fat infiltration compared to controls, and that more fat accumulation will be related to declines in strength and functional mobility."

Building land-based resilience in Fraser Valley First Nations Youth 
This project develops a team and an Indigenous research approach to explore youth suicide prevention in First Nations youth. In order to develop the team and our approach, we will forefront Indigenous ideas as we create our processes and train the team.  The project will build from the work completed in Component 1: a youth resiliency strategy with Seabird Island Band with their Youth Council, Elders, and a Guiding Group. Building youth resiliency will be protective against suicide. The goal is to build from the lessons learned through the project so that the resiliency strategy can be adapted for four other First Nations communities: Scowlitz, Sumas, Mission and Bella Coola. The project draws on Indigenous ways of knowing as they are lived in Seabird Island community. We will be engaging youth; elders; community agencies working with children, youth and families; health agencies; and prevention programs, to ensure that we have a full and broad perspective on suicide prevention. There will be ongoing collaboration, knowledge seeking, and knowledge exchange."

We will work closely with local environmental agencies and local communities (Fort McKay First Nation) and collect indoor dust from resident homes and outdoor ash samples. We will measure the concentration of known toxic compounds in environmental dust that can be compared to safety guidelines. Using advanced lung models, we will also assess the overall toxicity of environmental dust in the lungs, and how the toxicity changes under environmental conditions.

"HYBRID MINDS:  Experiential, Ethical and Legal Exploration of Intelligent Neuroprostheses","['Chandler, Jennifer A']",['N/A'],"['Artificial Intelligence', 'Law', 'Neuroethics', 'Neuroprostheses', 'User Centered Design']",205701.0,426721,"Intelligent neuroprostheses represent the next phase in the evolution of devices integrated with the nervous system to assist, replace or alter human sensory, motor, cognitive, and affective functions. These devices include ""read out"" or output systems that detect, interpret and translate neural signals for various applications such as to allow a paralyzed person to move a robotic arm or cursor.  They also include ""write in"" or input systems that deliver signals or stimulation to the brain, to alter thinking, emotions, and the ability to move, among other things.  The technology is increasingly incorporating Artificial Intelligence (AI) to create neuroprostheses that adapt automatically without voluntary user input. The current rate of development of AI-based neurotechnology systems is outpacing ethical reflections and is challenging regulatory systems. The current technological departure lies in the complexity, unpredictability, and psychological impact of the integration of AI with human brains and minds. Such hybrid minds are characterized by mutual adaptation, in which both user and self-learning algorithm change over time to optimize system output. Such interactions become even more intricate when ""write-into"" devices generate stimuli that directly influence mental contents and cognitive processes of users. Our project attempts to lay the foundations for a unified theoretical approach to the ethical-legal assessment of intelligent neuroprostheses, informed by the experiences and perspectives of users, and in dialogue with the neuroengineering community and other key stakeholders, culminating in the central questions: Which AI-elements should future neuroprostheses incorporate, or rather leave out? What technical design choices or legal/regulatory measures are required? How can we support patients in clinical decision-making to avoid overblown hopes and to know, to borrow Thomas Nagel's famous phrase, ""what it's like to have a hybrid mind""?"

While this research has been aimed at addressing disorders or deficits, the same interventions (e.g. externally applied electrical or magnetic stimulation of the brain)  can often be turned toward enhancement uses in people without disorders or deficits, as they are currently conceived.  These brain-based interventions may alter our perceptions of the agency and capacity of patients, and accordingly of their responsibility.  People may be reproached for untreated problematic behaviours that could be avoided through treatment, or for the unintended behavioural consequences of therapeutic or enhancement uses of brain-interventions where they are applied.  At the same time, a complex web of potential responsibility draws together the individual who chooses (or refuses) to use these interventions, the maker, marketer and medical personnel who provide the interventions, third parties who may be benefited or harmed by the use or non-use of the interventions, and the broader society that stands to be affected in more diffuse ways.  The Canadian part of this interdisciplinary biomedical ethics project will provide a comprehensive analysis of the complexity of ethical and legal responsibility in relation to brain-based interventions intended to modify human capacities but that may also pose some risks of harm to the individual and to others.  In particular, this project will provide patients, clinicians, and health policy-makers (e.g. drug and device licensing authorities) with the careful analysis necessary to understand the potential legal ramifications of these treatment decisions.  These issues will form an important part of the context within which clinicians and patients will have to navigate as they consider whether to use the fruits of this neuroscientific research."
Disease Discourse and the Social Structural Context of Peer Outreach Programs in HIV/AIDS Prevention,"['Chang, Christine S']",['N/A'],"['Community-Based Outreach', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Participatory Action Research', 'Peer Support And Outreach']",17500.0,234705,"Studies of the efficacy of HIV/AIDS prevention programs within a community of injection drug users (IDUs) have demonstrated that community-based outreach models such as peer-run education and support programs have been effective in reducing HIV transmission as well as HIV risk behaviours.  However, the impact of these programs on existing social networks - critical in the diffusion of prevention information within drug-using communities - among drug users has been overlooked.  Also, more focus has been placed on the outcomes of these programs rather than the processes through which these programs are successful.  To address these gaps, the proposed thesis will explore how peer (current and former drug users who either access or provide outreach services) relations are forged in, and affected by peer-run outreach in the HIV risk environment.  Specific objectives include: (1) to examine the power dynamics and other relations between peers; (2) to investigate how peers' beliefs and attitudes towards HIV/AIDS and drug-use are affected by these programs; and (3) to explore the extent to which empowerment is facilitated or hindered through this particular approach to harm reduction.

Working in collaboration with Vancouver Coastal Health's Peer 2 Peer program, the proposed research will take place in the Commercial Drive and Grandview Woodlands area.  To provide an anthropological perspective on the structural and environmental context of peer-run outreach, participatory action and qualitative (one-on-one, open-ended) interviews will be conducted with peers providing services.  This project will contribute to existing research on cultural models of peer-run outreach by identifying processes by which peers utilize their social networks to distribute information, materials, support, and advice."

While the potential impacts of climate change on northern food security has been highlighted for several years, limited research has sought to explicitly link environmental change with nutrition implications for Inuit. Working with the community of Qikiqtarjuaq, this project aims to co-construct innovative methodologies and adaptation strategies to address the impact of climate change on food security in the Canadian North.
 The main research questions are:
O1. How can local oceanographic and marine ecosystem and diet/health data be integrated to address key questions regarding climate change and food security?
O2. What strategies can be used to proactively respond to climate change to support food security at different levels? 
This two-year project will deliver feasibility adaptation plans for the community of Qikiqtarjuaq and models and frameworks that can be used by a follow-up Research Team to translate the knowledge to other Inuit regions and communities."

High Interindividual Cellular Heterogeneity in Pediatric Saliva: A Deep Dive into Its Contributing Factors and Significance in DNA Methylation Analyses,"['Chan, Meingold']",['N/A'],"['Bioinformatics', 'Biomarker', 'Cellular Deconvolution', 'Cellular Heterogeneity', 'Dna Methylation', 'Epigenomics', 'Intrinsic & Extrinsic Factors', 'Methodology', 'Pediatric Health', 'Salivary Bioscience']",90000.0,492707,"Epigenetics holds promise in understanding how genes and environment together affect children's health. DNA methylation (DNAm) is a commonly studied epigenetic marker. Saliva, an easily accessible biological sample, is commonly used in studying DNAm in children. However, the diverse cell types present in saliva can complicate DNAm analysis, potentially leading to inaccurate results. Another layer to this challenge is that salivary cell composition is distinct between children and adults. Currently, the same tool is used to predict salivary cell composition in both children and adults but this may not be appropriate. Further, the source of these cellular differences is underexplored. Researchers need to gain a better understanding of these factors to analyze children's salivary epigenetic data appropriately. 

This study aims to address this challenge by comparing different tools used for predicting cell composition in children's saliva and investigating the factors influencing these cell compositions using saliva samples of 533 7-year-olds from a large pediatric cohort, the Family Life Project. The project hypothesizes that different prediction tools as well as intrinsic and extrinsic factors like oral inflammation and socio-economic status, respectively, can contribute to predicted cell compositions. This study also delves into how this cellular diversity affects results from DNAm analyses. For example, will DNAm signals significantly differ across children with very high and very lower percentage of blood cell even after accounting for cell type compositions in statistical model? By understanding these complexities, researchers hope to improve future epigenetic research involving pediatric saliva and use more appropriate epigenetic analyses to better study how genes and environment can influence children's health."

Emerging evidence suggests that adolescents who experience peer victimization are at increased risk for substance use (e.g., cigarette and alcohol use). A better understanding of this peer victimization-substance use relationship over time and the specific role of cyber victimization is needed and can inform interventions to reduce adolescent substance use.  The proposed research includes two studies that will address important research gaps.  Study 1 will examine whether peer victimization experiences (including cyber victimization) lead to increases in adolescent cigarette and alcohol use over time. Participants are 1170 high school students who completed various measures at three time points.  This study will also examine how gender, social support, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms may potentially affect the relationship between peer victimization and substance use.  Study 2 will examine whether a school-based preventive intervention for peer victimized youth, that addresses cyber victimization, will lead to reductions in adolescent substance use. Specifically, an Open Trial will first test the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a 12-session PEERS intervention. A pilot randomized-controlled trial of the PEERS intervention will then be conducted with 48 adolescents. The proposed studies hold significant implications for adolescent health, as they will elucidate the relationships between types of peer victimization (including cyber victimization) and youth's substance use and also examine the potential impact of a peer victimization-related intervention on youth's substance use."

The Dementia Population Risk Tool (DemPoRT) was developed to help inform adults of their risk of developing dementia in the next five years based on self-reportable measures such as sociodemographic, lifestyle, behavioural, and health condition factors. With the discovery of new risk factors that are associated with dementia (such as hearing impairment, environmental factors, and genetic risk factors), the goal of this research project is to improve on the existing DemPoRT model based on recent findings, as adding these emerging risk factors may improve the algorithm's performance in predicting the risk of developing dementia. Using national-level data from Baseline and Follow-up 1 of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, my first aim is to understand how prevalent each of these newly identified predictors are amongst older Canadians who have dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The second goal is to develop and internally validate a new prediction model that includes the emerging risk factors and predicts an older Canadian's risk of developing MCI or dementia. Building an improved model will not only help clinicians and patients in assessing their risk for dementia, but it will also help policy makers better predict the number of Canadians who will be affected by MCI or dementia in the future and allow for them to make more informed decisions for healthcare planning."

On average, MetS effects 25% of women aged 30-79 years in North American communities. This disease is defined by six main factors including; obesity, high levels of LDL and VLDL cholesterol (""bad"" cholesterol),low levels of HDL cholesterol (""good"" cholesterol), high blood pressure, high blood sugar levels, insulin resistance and high levels of inflammatory hormones in the body including C-reactive protein (CRP),plasma plasminogen activator inhibitor(PAI)-1 and fibrinogen.  Most importantly, MetS is a warning sign for the future development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD), which are the leading causes of death in North America.  Research has shown that physical activity, stress reduction, and healthy diet changes can prevent and help treat chronic diseases like MetS, CVD and diabetes. To-date, little is known about the therapeutic potential of yoga for MetS in new mothers.  The purpose of this study is to examine the risk for MetS in women 12-24 weeks following childbirth.  In addition, we will examine the effect of a yoga intervention on risk of MetS. To our knowledge, this study is the first to focus on MetS prevention and treatment through yoga in new mothers. One hundred women will be recruited and randomly selected to participate in either a 12 week yoga exercise group or a normal care group.  The yoga group will meet for 1 hour twice per week to practice physical postures, breathing and meditation techniques. Metabolic Syndrome, quality of life and health literacy status will be tested before and after the yoga program in both groups.  At the end of the study, the normal treatment group will also be given a chance to take part in the yoga program.  This study has important implications for improving quality of life, as well as decreasing the risk for MetS and related chronic disease in mothers following childbirth."
Effects of Active Video Games on Energy Balance: A Randomized Crossover Study in Adolescents,"['Chaput, Jean-Philippe']","['Doucet, Eric', 'Tremblay, Mark S']","['Active Video Games', 'Adolescents', 'Appetite Control', 'Energy Balance']",100000.0,259486,"In terms of children's health, active video games would appear to be advantageous over sedentary video games as the video activity burns more calories. However, significant increases in physical activity as a result of active video game play might be of little importance to prevent weight gain if one compensates by increasing food intake and/or decreasing physical activity subsequent to the intervention. This issue is supported by recent results from our group showing that sedentary video game playing increases food intake in adolescents. Thus, a careful examination of the effects of active video games on both sides of the energy balance equation (i.e. eating and activity) is needed in order to determine whether active video games may play a role in decreasing risk of obesity. To answer this question, 30 normal-weight and 30 obese adolescents (13-17 years) will be engaged in each of the 3 following conditions: (1) resting in a sitting, relaxing position on a comfortable chair (control condition); (2) playing Xbox 360 (sedentary video game condition); and (3) playing Kinect (active video game condition). Each participant will do the activity for 1 hour. Food intake and physical activity will be measured for a 3-day period. Additionally, we will gather information on indicators of stress, appetite and key appetite hormones. The present study is innovative and likely to result in a number of new and important findings that can inform future recommendations. If we confirm our hypothesis, the clinical implication will be to rethink the strategy of promoting active video games as an intervention tool for the prevention of overweight and obesity in youth."

A total of 141 articles, including 592,215 participants from 40 different countries, met inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Overall, longer sleep duration was associated with lower adiposity indicators, better emotional regulation, better academic achievement, and better quality of life/well-being. The evidence was mixed and/or limited for the association between sleep duration and cognition, harms/injuries, and cardiometabolic biomarkers. The quality of evidence ranged from very low to high across study designs and health indicators. In conclusion, we confirmed previous investigations showing that shorter sleep duration is associated with adverse physical and mental health outcomes. In order to better inform contemporary sleep recommendations, there is a need for sleep restriction/extension interventions that examine the changes in different outcome measures against various amounts of sleep to have a better sense of dose-response relationships."

Thus, the objective of this study is to examine the effect of lengthening sleep in habitually short-sleeping adolescents presenting with risk factors for T2D on markers of blood sugar. A total of 74 obese adolescents between 14 and 17 years of age with abnormal blood sugar levels and who habitually sleep less than 8 hours on school nights will participate in this sleep manipulation protocol. Participants will sleep their typical amount at home for 1 week and will then be assigned to two experimental conditions lasting two weeks each: prescribed habitual sleep (sleep time set to match baseline) and sleep extension (1.5-hour increase in time in bed from habitual sleep). Sleep will be obtained at home and will be directly measured using a device worn on the wrist. We will then compare blood measures between both sleep conditions at the end. If we confirm our hypothesis that increased sleep duration results in better insulin function, the implication will be to include ""sleep"" in the list of preventative measures aimed at preventing T2D in youth."

We will conduct a study using accurate biological tests to detect cannabis in blood samples from early and late pregnancy in 1950 participants from a representative pregnancy cohort study, and examine how it is associated with measures of infant and child development and mental health up to age 13. We will also conduct brain MRI scans and detailed psychological assessments to measure I.Q, executive functioning and mental health in a subset of children in the study. Our study will have a highly accurate measure of cannabis use in pregnancy and be able to detangle the influence of other substances on child development, addressing the weaknesses in evidence published to date. It will provide important new evidence around the safety of cannabis use in pregnancy. It will also identify the risks of prenatal cannabis exposure to child cognitive development, social-emotional development and mental health in the long term, ensuring that children with prenatal cannabis exposure can receive the supports they need most to thrive."

Disruptive behaviours are highly distressing for both child and family. Family experiences that reflect variation in income, neighbourhood quality, and family functioning are associated with disruptive behaviours. Likewise, child health behaviours (such as too little physical activity or sleep, too much screen time, or poor eating behaviours) are also associated with disruptive behaviours. However, it is unclear how different family experiences and child health behaviours combine to impact child disruptive behaviours in later childhood. This project will determine how family experiences and child health behaviours (screen use, drinking sugar sweetened beverages, physical activity, sleep duration) at 3-5 years of age combine to potentially impact later disruptive behaviour at 5-9 years of age. This study will use data already collected on 1,600 children and new data collected on 1,000 children at 3-5 years of age and at 5-9 years of age during visits to their primary care provider. We will use machine learning to find the family experiences and child health behaviours that are most strongly associated with child disruptive behaviour. Then, we will identify patterns in family experiences and child health behaviours to see how different combinations and patterns of these variables are associated with variation in disruptive behaviour. Understanding the specific patterns of family experiences and child health behaviours that are associated with disruptive behaviours is a key step to identify new treatment targets and extend innovative prevention and interventions that recognise different family experiences."

As an Applied Public Health Chair applicant, I am well situated to support high-quality research that is relevant to promoting mental health of children, youth and their families in a manner that engages service providers, decision makers, researchers and graduate students.  The Healthy Child Manitoba Office, which works with 10 government departments, has agreed to collaborate with me in achieving the following objectives: 1) learning more about how children and their families develop mental disorders 2) learning more about what works to improve the mental well-being of children, youth and families and also what works in closing the gap in the mental health of children living in poverty and those who are not, 3) ensuring that people overseeing the mental health field are involved with the research and keep the findings in mind when planning programs and developing policies and 4) mentoring graduate students and new researchers to prepare the next generation of mental health researchers. The lessons learned in mental health promotion of young people will be useful to other Canadian provinces. Over the next five years, we will be in a better position to understand what works and for whom as well as how and why it works in promoting good mental health for Canadian young people and their families."

In adolescent research comparing different types of deliberate self-harm (DSH), NSSI was associated with borderline personality features, while major depression and posttraumatic stress disorder were associated with suicide attempts (SA). In addition, NSSI was associated with higher incidents of DSH during treatment and childhood abuse and neglect. The study of NSSI, however, has been widely neglected in adults. The current research aims to investigate the relationship between different types of DSH (i.e., SA only, NSSI only, both SA and NSSI, and no DSH) among adults and risk factors, mental disorders, and treatment outcomes in three separate studies. Study 1 will determine which mental disorders are associated with each DSH group and whether different DSH groups are associated with different risk factors. Study 2 will investigate these relationships longitudinally, to determine the course of different types of DSH. Study 3 will compare treatment outcomes in the different groups of DSH. Participants will be selected from Suicide Assessment Form in Emergency Psychiatry (SAFE) database. The SAFE database is comprised of all consecutive adults who are assessed by psychiatric services at two Manitoba hospitals. Data collection is ongoing, with a sample size of 6,918 as of December, 2011.  The SAFE database will also be linked to the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy (MCHP) databases which will enable examination of the relationship between DSH groups and suicide outcome measures, psychiatric diagnoses, medication prescription and treatment utilization. This research will play a crucial role in understanding the prevalence, course and treatment of DSH and help to prevent suicide among North American adults."

For my Masters research, I will look at the role of social support on the development of other mental and physical disorders, suicidality and quality of life in those who suffer from PTSD. I predict that social support will have a buffering effect on the relationship between PTSD and the development of other mental and physical disorders, suicidality and quality of life, where higher levels of perceived social support will protect against the development of subsequent physical and mental disorders, poor quality of life and suicidality. The data will come from the Canadian Community Health Survey Cycle 1.2 (N = 36,984; response rate 77%). Among respondents diagnosed with PTSD, I will perform multiple logistic regressions to compare those with high levels of perceived social support, to those with low levels of perceived social support. Dependent variables to be examined include: quality of life, suicidality, mood and anxiety disorders, alcohol and drug dependence, chronic physical health conditions, and disability.

However, it's major limitation is that it does not incorporate features and aspects of the physical environment of the care setting. Inclusion of this important dimension of the care environment by development of a physical environmental evaluation component (DCM-ENV) as part of DCM will strengthen the tool on several aspects. Conceptually, it would make DCM more grounded in the whole care environment that could support a person-centred care approach. From care evaluaion perspective, the identification of the effect of physical environmental features on the quality of care practices will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the multiple dimensions that effect care practice. This understanding would identify aspects of the physical environment in a care setting that can be modified for creation of a more person-centred care environment."

However, the benefits to immigrants' health and wellbeing are unknown when smaller cities are unprepared to meet their needs in the context of financial cuts to essential services and immigrant settlement services. Therefore, this study seeks to understand: 1) What are the roles of settlement experiences in shaping recent visible ethnic minority immigrants' health and wellbeing in the social-geographic context of smaller cities?  2) How do recent ethnic minority immigrants conceptualize an understanding of their health and wellbeing in their social-geographical context?  3) What are the strategies that recent visible ethnic minority immigrants develop and use to maintain their health and wellbeing in smaller cities?  The study seeks to illuminate the experience of immigrants in small cities by making their existence and life conditions visible by using Photovoice, a Participatory Action Research (PAR) method.  A sample of 72 eligible participants ages 24 to 44 will be drawn from Kelowna, British Columbia, Red Deer, Alberta, and Brandon, Manitoba.

While housing status (e.g., homelessness) has previously been identified as a factor that influence the health of PWUD living with HIV and other vulnerable populations, little is known about the health consequences of residential displacement. Residential displacement is defined as the involuntary move of households from residence, such as when eviction or rent increase forces tenants out of housing. The ongoing affordable housing crisis alongside social distancing orders (e.g., no-guest policies in low-income housing) and a looming eviction crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to further displace low-income, marginalized groups across North America. The proposed study based in Vancouver, Canada will be among the first to examine how residential displacement influences health. Using innovative research methods that involve interviews, observations, and mapping, this study will follow 40 PWUD living with HIV for a period of one year to explore the impact of residential displacement on health among this population.

"The impact of health insurance vs. unconditional cash transfer on socio-economic and neurobiological welfare measures of the poor: evidence from randomized experiments in the slums of Nairobi, undertaken by an international collaboration between a ""Jua kali"" community, Kenyan health insurance providers, economists, neuroscientists, and Kenyan policy decision makers","['Chemin, Matthieu']","['Fehr, Ernst', 'Haushofer, Johannes']","['Depression', 'Health Insurance', 'Neurobiological Well-Being Measures', 'Poverty Reduction', 'Stress', 'Unconditional Cash Transfer']",331195.0,254550,"The lack of health insurance and the persistence of poverty are intricately related. According to the 2001 World Development Report, ""reducing vulnerability to economic shocks, ill health, disability, and personal violence, is an intrinsic part of enhancing well-being of the poor and encourages investment in human capital and in higher-risk, higher-return activities"". In this way, health insurance may mitigate the risks faced by poor individuals.

Health insurance schemes generally improve health care access, but not always for the very poor, if, for example, transport costs to the hospital are in fact the largest expenses. An unconditional cash transfer of the same amount may actually be more beneficial as the poor are better placed to know their needs and if they do not squander their money on unnecessary non-durables.

The relative merit of health insurance over UCT is thus an open empirical question, and has never been studied before. This project will address this gap in the literature by providing the first randomized experiment on the relative merits of health insurance vs UCT, by comparing a group of poor households offered free health insurance to a control group offered the cash equivalent. The survey will include questions regarding the economic situation of the member and his/her family. Moreover, to assess health and psychological well-being, saliva and blood samples will be collected to measure biomarkers of stress, in particular cortisol and cytokine levels. An important question concerns the willingness to pay for insurance. The partnership will thus implement six different interventions aimed at increasing take-up of health insurance. 

These randomized experiments will thus directly inform insurance providers and policy makers about the scale-up of health insurance vs UCT provision, not only in Kenya but also elsewhere in the world, and have the potential to benefit the lives of millions of people currently out of reach of these products."

There are effective programs to prevent the development of mental health problems.  If we can identify the children at risk at an early age, we can target interventions at these children and minimize the impact of mental health problems.  The objective of this proposed project is to link existing clinical and administrative databases in British Columbia (BC) in order to study the association between the developmental status of children in kindergarten and their use of mental health services for significant mental health problems in later childhood.  These databases include the (1) EDI ¿ results of an instrument that assesses children¿s social, emotional and cognitive development and that is administered to all kindergarten children in BC; and (2) the CARIS and BCFPI ¿ electronic systems which track the children and youth referred to community mental health services in BC and also assess their symptoms and functioning.  In this project, we will negotiate agreements with data holders to access these databases, arrange for linkage to be performed, and assess the outcome of the linkage.  Once linkage is successfully completed, we can conduct further research to investigate whether the dimensions of early child development in the EDI predict the emergence of mental health problems and use of mental health services in later childhood.  Such knowledge will increase our understanding of the risk factors for mental disorders in children, facilitate the early identification of children at risk and greatly benefit the development of policies and programs to prevent mental health problems."
Leaving the Familiar Behind: Predictors of Friendship Formation and Social Integration in New Communities,"['Chen, Frances']",['N/A'],"['Molecular Genetics', 'Neuroendocrinology', 'Social Comparison', 'Social Relationships', 'Social Support', 'Stress']",300000.0,340704,"Social connections and social support networks are essential for physical and mental health. In fact, how long people live is better predicted by the quality of their social relationships and how well they are integrated in their community, than it is by how much they smoke and drink, or whether they are obese. Loneliness, on the other hand, is strongly associated with negative health outcomes including depression, poor sleep quality, more hospital and doctor visits, and compromised immune system functioning.

My research investigates the processes involved in successful social interactions with strangers, friendship formation, and social integration. I focus on questions including: What motivates people to seek social contact, and why do some people have a harder time making friends than others? How do people cope successfully with social stress and social setbacks? How do people develop a larger sense of belonging when they move to a new community? These are timely topics, given that North American cultures are characterized by high rates of immigration and residential mobility.

Specifically, I will examine whether and how genetic variants, psychological beliefs about oneself and others, and specific behaviours such as eye contact and mimicry, influence the outcome of social interactions. I will also investigate the long-term consequences of neurobiology, beliefs, and behaviour on the social integration outcomes of people moving to a new community. Moving to a new community can be highly stressful, and successfully establishing a new social support network during this transition has substantial long-term effects on health. Indeed, social support is one of the most important buffers against the detrimental effects of stress. In the long term, I plan to use the findings of this research to identify people who are likely to experience difficulty transitioning into new environments and to develop strategies for promoting healthy coping and socialization."
"The gender difference in vascular risk factors, early cognitive impairment and progression to dementia","['Chen, Guanmin', 'Hachinski, Vladimir', 'Quan, Hude']","['Faris, Peter D']","['Gender Difference In Vascular Risk Factors And Aging', 'Vascular Risk Factors Control And Cognitive Impariment']",69856.0,353014,"Over the past decade, much literature has focused on vascular risk factors that contribute to dementia, especially concerning early cognitive impairment. Most cases of early cognitive impairment - the presence of memory complaints, detectable memory impairment, and the absence of functional impairment - will develop into dementia. Thus in recent years, early cognitive impairment has become an interest area for interventions that seek to prevent or slow its progress. It has been hypothesized that vascular risk factors have deleterious effects on cognition, and that controlling these risk factors will prevent dementia within the population.

The effects of hypertension treatment on cognitive impairment is limited, and debate remains as to whether controlling hypertension leads to better cognitive outcomes, especially for overt dementia. Using data from the Canadian Study in Health and Aging, our team found that hypertension is associated with executive dysfunction, which contributes to the progression of dementia, but not memory dysfunction or overall cognitive impairment. We are currently working on two manuscripts for publication that show this pattern. One reason for this association may be that executive dysfunction is characteristic of cerebrovascular disease, and that vascular risk factors significantly affect this domain but other much less. Some studies have indicated that women have a higher risk incidence rate of dementia or Alzheimer's disease than men, while others have not shown a difference. It is unclear whether women have a higher vascular risk than men and develop cognitive impairment, as well as progression to dementia. Therefore our goal for this study is to explore gender difference in vascular risk factors, treatment, and their association with cognitive impairment using data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging."
Cardiovascular incidence from exposure to outdoor air pollution,"['Chen, Hong']","['Brook, Jeffrey R', 'Burnett, Richard T', 'Copes, Raymond A', 'Goldberg, Mark S', 'Kwong, Jeffrey C', 'Tu, Jack V', 'Villeneuve, Paul J']","['Air Pollution', 'Cardiovascular Disease', 'Cohort Study', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Etiology', 'Spatial Random Effect Cox Proportional Hazards Model']",193947.0,292149,"Exposure to some level of outdoor air pollution is essentially universal throughout life. The ubiquity of this exposure, albeit at varying levels, underlies the public health importance of air pollution and its plausibility as a risk factor for the development of common chronic diseases. Health Canada estimated that air pollution was responsible for 5,900 deaths among Canadians annually. More recently, the Global Burden of Disease Study estimated that in 2010 alone air pollution caused 3.2 million deaths worldwide, making it the 7th leading cause of death globally and the 8th in Canada. 

Mounting evidence now links millions of cardiovascular deaths worldwide to air pollution. There is also a growing body of evidence supporting a possible relationship between the development of coronary heart disease and air pollution. However, whether air pollution contributes to the incidence of other cardiovascular diseases is less clear. Particularly, there is little information on the effects of air pollution on atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and stroke, three major cardiovascular conditions with serious and potentially fatal consequences. 

To determine the relationship between air pollution and the incidence of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and stroke, we will conduct a large population study by following up about 110,000 adults in Ontario. We will use provincial health administrative databases to identify incident cases. State-of-the-art methods will be used to estimate air pollution exposure. 

This study will address a critical gap in knowledge regarding the development of these three diseases. This evidence is highly relevant to environmental and public health policy given the magnitude of the population exposed to air pollution and the substantial public health impact associated with these three cardiovascular conditions. Ultimately, the findings from this study will contribute to an improved understanding of the global burden of cardiovascular disease."
Do cardiovascular medications mitigate the adverse effects of air pollution on increasing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality?,"['Chen, Hong', 'Kwong, Jeffrey C']","['Brook, Jeffrey R', 'Burnett, Richard T', 'Copes, Raymond A', 'Jerrett, Michael L', 'Martin, Randall V', 'Tu, Jack V', 'Villeneuve, Paul J']","['Air Pollution', 'Cardiovascular Disease', 'Interventions', 'Medications', 'Population-Based']",100000.0,351849,"Exposure to ambient air pollution, even at very low levels, is known to worsen the long-term outcomes of people with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recent research shows that common cardiovascular (CV) medications with anti-inflammatory and vascular-regulating properties are very effective in modifying pathological responses induced by air pollution. In light of growing evidence on CV medications in relation to air pollution, an American Heart Association scientific panel called for exploring research on medical management as a potential strategy to reduce the harmful effects of air pollution on CV patients. To date, however, no study has examined the potential role of CV medications in modifying pollution-related morbidity and mortality.

To remedy this research gap, we propose to conduct a study to investigate which routinely-used medications modify the impact of air pollution on CV morbidity and mortality. We also aim to assess to what extent these impacts differ by dosing/potency, duration, indication of use, and adherence. Our study population will include the entire elderly Ontario residents (~3 million). We will use state-of-the-art methods (e.g., satellite-based remote sensing) to derive estimates of air pollution exposures. We will examine the potential impacts of five common classes of CV medications. 

This will be the first study to perform these evaluations. By being driven by research needs of healthcare providers, our study will have direct, measurable impact and can lead to immediate interventions. Patients and clinicians will be able to use our findings to develop proactive actions to reduce risks. Policy makers can likewise gain insights into whether the continuous decline in air pollution and the increasing use of CV medications in Canada together yield more health benefits than either alone - key information needed in setting public health policies. Ultimately, this may translate to improved outcomes in CVD patients in Canada."

Problematic alcohol consumption among first-year students, particularly those living in student residences, is highly influenced by the campus culture of heavy drinking and the students' desire to fit in. However, it remains unclear how universities can effectively address problematic drinking. 

This study aims to understand how alcohol culture affects alcohol use in first-year students' residences. This study will be conducted in the first-year residences at five Canadian universities in three provinces-University of Alberta, University of Calgary, University of Waterloo, Queen's University, and Dalhousie University. We will use a qualitative research method (Institutional ethnography) to explore the structure of students' everyday lives, specifically by looking at students' social interactions and understanding how those interactions influence their alcohol consumption. In Stage 1, we will interview students and residence service staff to understand their everyday experiences in the residences and how campus alcohol policies shape student behaviours. In Stage 2, six student peer-researchers on each campus will observe and photograph alcohol-related activities. They will work together to develop a description of the way students' alcohol use is organized and connected in the dormitory environment. We will also collect and analyze campus alcohol policies and alcohol-marketing materials. 

Through an understanding of the drinking culture, this study's results will reveal how campus alcohol-related intervention and health promotion can be better designed to reflect students' actual needs, and, in turn, inform campus alcohol policies and interventions. Final deliverables include specific recommendations for alcohol-related policy and practice at local and provincial levels."

Studies show that non-citizens in Canada are vulnerable to ill health, and multiple factors likely contribute to this. Theorists have posited that non-citizens' compromised national belonging may be one of the factors leading to their health vulnerability. Building on this premise, this project undertakes a series of planning and dissemination activities aiming at preparing the research team for a future study on the relationship between non-citizen residents' belonging in Canada and their health. Findings from this study would enable policymakers and service providers to better understand non-citizens' health and wellbeing, and to identify appropriate health interventions for them.

Three sets of preparatory activities are planned. First, a literature review will be conducted to canvass current knowledge on the link between national belonging and health, as well as on how systemic factors affect one's sense of national belonging.

Second, a pilot study will be carried out to compare and contrast the national belonging of stateless persons and that of long-term permanent residents. It will allow us to test our hypothesized connection between social inclusion/exclusion, sense of national belonging, and health. It will also give us an opportunity to evaluate the reliability and effectiveness of our research instruments and to make changes for the future study if necessary.

Third, a knowledge exchange and partnership building event will be organized in Spring 2018. It will give us an opportunity to share our research findings and to receive feedback from stakeholders. The event will also facilitate our networking with potential partners, with the goal of galvanizing their participation in our future study as collaborators."

Children can have high blood pressure and be overweight in early life, which can get carried into adult stages and make them more likely to get heart-related diseases. Therefore, it is important to study lifestyle aspects that influence early childhood growth. Adult studies have found that eating low amounts of vegetables and lots of high-energy ultra-processed foods (UPFs) is related to a higher chance of getting heart-related diseases. However, there are not many Canadian child studies on this topic. Also, starting puberty earlier is another life component that increases your chance of having heart-related diseases in adulthood. Currently, children around the world are entering puberty sooner than in the past. Lastly, UPFs are becoming more common in retail, where males are eating more UPFs than females. There needs to be more studies that look at the relationship between unhealthy, energy-dense diets in Canadian children and heart-related disease risks, and how puberty influences this. 

My work will fill this gap using information from the CHILD Cohort Study, the largest ongoing pregnancy cohort in Canada. I will describe dietary patterns and UPF intake at different childhood time periods, look for sex-specific associations between early life dietary patterns and UPF intake with high blood pressure and overweight status in later childhood, and find out if starting puberty earlier or on time influences the relationship. This work will inform both clinical and public health settings on the impact of early-life nutrition on heart-related diseases and puberty influences, which can further lead to informing community actions for reducing the amount of heart-related diseases in Canada."

The recent advent of free online classified advertisement websites (e.g. Craigslist, Facebook, Perb.ca) coupled with a decline in costs and restrictions associated with mobile phones in Canada have resulted in a dramatic rise in online and mobile phone/texting communication technologies between sex workers and buyers (clients) in both the street and off-street sex industry. However, despite global research demonstrating the critical role mobile phones may play in enhancing patient access to HIV prevention and treatment in resource-poor settings [1], there remains surprisingly limited information on the role of these communication strategies in reaching marginalized populations in high resource settings.

This research project proposes to describe the mobile phone and online communication strategies of female sex workers in Metropolitan Vancouver, and how use of these strategies may be associated with risk of HIV/STI infection and rates of violence.  We also propose to examine possible links between the increased use of mobile phone/online communication strategies and risk reduction practices with clients (e.g. condom use, types of sexual services provided, amount charged for sexual services).  Additionally, we will be exploring associations between these communication strategies and positive health outcomes, such as increased access to or use of health services and HIV/STI prevention tools, testing and treatment."
Knowledge Translation Theory and Practice in Addressing Protective Factors to Prevent Suicide among Males in Post-Secondary Education Settings,"['Cheung, Iva']",['N/A'],"['Focus Groups', 'Key Informant Interviews', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Males', 'Mental Health', 'Post-Secondary Education Settings', 'Sources Of Strength Program', 'Suicide Prevention']",105000.0,307789,"This project will focus on the problem of suicide among male students in post-secondary education settings. In Canada, the suicide rate among males is 3 to 4 times the rate of suicide among females, and male undergraduates are at higher risk for suicide because men (i) are more likely to take risks, (ii) are more likely to engage in hazardous patterns of drug and alcohol use, and (iii) are less likely to seek help for health-related problems, including mental health issues such as depression. These behaviours may result from traditional gender roles and ideas of masculine identity, including expectations of toughness, competitiveness, assertiveness, autonomy, and stoicism.

In response to the pervasive problem of suicide, particularly of males, on university campuses, there has been a rush to find effective ways to prevent suicide. A critical component of any suicide-prevention effort involves translating the findings of mental health researchers into effective programs and policies that can be implemented by post-secondary institutions and adopted by students and their families. This project involves developing and testing the effectiveness of different knowledge translation (KT) approaches on the students and health service and suicide-prevention providers at Simon Fraser University, the University of Calgary, and the University of Manitoba. This research will take an interdisciplinary approach to KT, drawing from not only established KT theory and practice but also clear communication principles from other sources, including the plain language and technical communication communities. These KT activities will contribute to a set of principles and guidelines for effective and efficient communication of mental health research information to those who can act on it for better health literacy and, ultimately, better health outcomes in the general population."

In 2017, over 10 million adults in the United States reported misusing prescription opioids and close to 2 million met the diagnostic criteria for an opioid use disorder. Patients with cancer represent a particularly vulnerable population that may be at high risk for chronic opioid use because of distress from their illness, multiple invasive procedures, pain from their underlying cancer or treatment, and poor coordination in prescribing due to the large number of healthcare providers involved in their care. Patients with no prior opioid use are at risk of becoming chronic opioid users, and chronic opioid users are at risk of misusing opioids, both of which can result in substantial morbidity and mortality. Little is known about the patterns of chronic opioid use in the cancer setting. There is also a lack of information on the experiences and attitudes of patients and prescribers about the risks of opioids. Policies have been proposed to guide safer prescribing of opioids to cancer patients, but little evidence is available to support the implementation of these policies. Our aim is to better understand the risk of chronic opioid use in the cancer population, its associated outcomes, physicians' decision-making process when prescribing, and specific patient factors. We will conduct a retrospective cohort study of non-metastatic cancer patients undergoing cancer therapy in Alberta. We aim to describe the burden of chronic opioid use, identify patients who are at high risk of chronic opioid use, and estimate the effects of preventing chronic opioid use on hospitalizations and survival. We will also explore prescribers' and patients' views and experiences with opioids. This information can be used to inform safer opioid prescribing practices."
Uncovering the immunological landscape of HIV antibody responses,"['Cheung, Yin Kiu']",['N/A'],"['Antibody Responses', 'Genetics', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Infectious Disease', 'Statistics', 'Vaccine Development']",150000.0,302297,"Significance, Hypothesis
HIV/AIDs is a major disease infecting 34 million individuals worldwide, and the number of infected people continue to rise in Canada, leading to a serious burden in high-risk populations. The development of a HIV vaccine requires global effort and is important to the control of spread of the virus. However, vaccination efforts are complicated by the fact that the human immune system is unable to trigger an protective response against HIV, because viruses mutate rapidly during an infection, allowing them to escape antibody neutralization. Broadly neutralizing antibodies (BNAbs) are more robust to viral mutation and neutralization escape. Therefore, promoting the immune system to produce BNAbs is a key strategy to developing an effective HIV vaccine.

Research Plan
As a CIHR fellow, I plan to develop statistical methods that are necessary to gain better understanding of the potency and breadth of BNAbs to neutralize HIV strains. The study will be based on HIV neutralization profiles generated from extensive wet-lab experiments by collaborators at the HIV Vaccine Trials Network based at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

To appropriately analyze this complex high-dimensional data, we propose to use 'antigenic cartography' to model neutralization of virus-antibody pairs, which has already proved exceptionally useful to understanding cross-protective relationships among influenza strains. By providing a rigorous statistical foundation to the analysis of the HIV data, we can quantify neutralization ability of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) to suggesting optimal targets for vaccine research and identify the additional benefit of using a combination of MAbs. While our project focuses on HIV/AIDs, these statistical methods can also be used to help improve the selection of vaccine strain in numerous other antigenically variable pathogens, including influenza and dengue viruses."

On ne peut plus nier l'importance du contexte socioéconomique et culturel dans la répartition de la TB.  En particulier,  l'importance des différences d'accès aux soins et de résultats au traitement selon que l'ont soit un hommes ou une femme femmes est certaine. Ainsi, on relève des risques accrus pour les femmes de progression de la maladie si leur état de santé global est moins élevé ainsi que des réactions à l'égard de la maladie qui diffèrent selon le sexe. De plus, les obstacles à une détection précoce et au traitement de la tuberculose varient et sont probablement plus grands chez les femmes et que l'ostracisme social associé à la tuberculose a un impact plus important sur les femmes.

A total of 88 countries currently conduct Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS), the annual use of insecticides on the interior walls of residences to control malaria.  Although recognized effective in curbing malaria, IRS exposes 120 million people to high levels of insecticides with poorly understood health consequences.  Evidence from animal studies strongly suggests that exposure to insecticides commonly used for IRS, such as DDT (dichlorodiphenyl trichloroethane) and pyrethroids, may adversely impact the immune system.  However, no studies have examined the potential effect of these insecticides on immune function in populations in which IRS is conducted.  These populations are likely to be particularly susceptible to the toxic effects of insecticides due to poverty, malnutrition and poor health.  Due to their limited detoxifying capabilities, children are believed to be most at risk.  We propose to extend an existing U.S. National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)-funded birth cohort study of 752 mother-child pairs taking place in South Africa to assess associations between prenatal exposure to IRS insecticides and 1) immune function and 2) allergic airway disease in children aged 3.5 and 5 years.  This study will provide data to help define least-toxic strategies to malaria control.  It will generate unique data on a question with global implications at limited costs due to a substantial investment ($US 3.6M) by NIEHS to initiate this study.

Factors such as inadequate sanitation, difficult access to clean water, deficient health care systems and incomplete vaccine coverage are important determinants of infectious disease occurrence, accumulating evidence suggests that exposure to environmental immunotoxicants may play a role. DDT and pyrethroid insecticides are commonly used as part of Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) programs, resulting in high exposure to children. Residents of IRS areas often use solid fuels such as wood and other biomass, which causes high exposure to household air pollution (HAP). Experimental in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that postnatal exposure to DDT, pyrethroids and HAP may inhibit immune response to vaccines and trigger allergic airway diseases. However, few human studies have investigated the question and no study has evaluated the combined effect of insecticides and HAP. 
The objective of this proposal is to characterize postnatal exposure to DDT, pyrethroid insecticides and PM2.5, and to determine whether exposure to these contaminants impact the immune system among highly-exposed South African children.

Pathways to healthier and inclusive campus food: Engaging diverse students and leadership to guide the design of healthy eating interventions,"['Chiavaroli, Laura']","['Anderson, Gerald H', 'Chen, Victoria', 'Classens, Michael M', 'Cohen, Tamara R', ""L'Abbe, Mary R"", 'Lee, Jennifer J', 'Malik, Vasanti', 'Panahi, Shirin', 'Vallis, Micheal T']","['Diverse Young Adults', 'Environmental Impact Of Foods', 'Food Insecurity', 'Food Systems', 'Nutrition Literacy', 'Postsecondary Institutions', 'Sustainability', 'Translating National Dietary Guidelines', 'Youth Climate Action']",20000.0,499889,"Our youth are wrestling climate anxiety, while facing a global population and planetary health crisis. Rising rates of obesity and diabetes are now significantly affecting young adults. An added layer to these challenges is the rise in food insecurity, which is linked to poor diet, health, and academic success in young adults. Our food systems are significant contributors to these interconnected challenges.  Many young adults live or spend significant time in universities or colleges, which represent tight communities with the potential to provide a healthy food environment and education to support food choices for personal and planetary health. 

To understand the barriers and needs of students to make, and food service teams to provide, healthier food choices, 3 meetings will be held at institutions across Canada over the year (June 2024 to May 2025). Students from diverse backgrounds and food service teams from a variety of institutions will join these meetings alongside scientists in nutrition, health, environment, and food insecurity, and organizations that can support change. Discussions will focus on identifying: 1. values and barriers in making healthy food choices and interests in information (health and environmental) to guide choices of diverse students, and 2. the challenges and needs of food service teams in changing menus to meet Canada's Food Guide, increase sustainability, and meet student needs.

This work will also support the creation of a diverse student advisory committee and strengthen partnerships with food service teams and collaborators to support changes. Together, these groups will meet 5 times to discuss identified research priorities and develop future studies of interventions to support healthier food environments and food choices. They will plan activities to expand reach, supporting equal access to healthy foods on more campuses to improve the health of young Canadian adults and future families."

Healthy diets can help manage blood sugar and improve many important risk factors for diabetes and heart disease. Low glycemic index, or low GI, diets encourage the consumption of carbohydrate-containing foods that result in a lower rise in blood sugar compared to higher GI foods. Low GI diets are recommended in guidelines globally to prevent and manage diabetes. Resources to support healthcare providers and communities in learning about how to follow low GI diets are lacking in Canada. With most Canadians having internet access, technology, such as mobile health apps, can help bridge this gap. 
To understand the needs of communities most affected by diabetes and other key individuals who support diabetes prevention and management guidance, 3 meetings will be held in various locations across the Peel region over the year (June 2024 to May 2025). Community health service partners will join these meetings and advertise for community members to join too. Discussions will focus on identifying preferred features in mobile health apps to help guide food choices, preferred ways to learn about low GI diets, and what outcomes in diabetes prevention studies are most meaningful to address. This study will also support the creation of an advisory committee of community members and strengthen partnerships between national health organizations and decision makers. Together, these partners will meet 5 times to develop future studies to co-design a mobile health app to help communities learn about low GI foods and support diet changes, and plan mobilization activities most important to communities at greatest risk of diabetes.

Leading causes of death in Canada and globally (heart disease, diabetes, obesity) all pose a greater risk to women and underrepresented groups. These differences underscore an urgent need for evidence to inform recommendations relevant to everyone. The realm of nutrition is of notable interest as modifiable dietary risk factors are the largest contributor globally to early death. Little is known about how sex and gender-related factors impact nutrition, but they may affect adherence. The Portfolio and low glycemic index (GI) diets are both widely recognized in clinical practice guidelines for heart disease and diabetes. Whether sex and gender-related factors alter the effect of these diets on risk of heart disease and diabetes has not been looked at. This may be due to lack of ability in any one study. 

This project will pool data on nearly 3,000 individual participants from 16 past trials on Portfolio and low GI diets. We will evaluate if the effects of these diets on risk factors for heart disease and diabetes vary by sex and gender-related factors (e.g., race/ethnicity, education, income, work, stress). A gender score will be calculated to assess differences across diverse groups and intersectional analyses will evaluate how having multiple social identities influences diet effects. Analyses will also determine predictors of diet adherence.

This work will show a new way to use existing data to understand how diet effects differ by measures of health inequities and will directly shape future recommendations for the Portfolio and low GI diets to increase societal relevance. This will directly inform patient-physician discussions on effective strategies to optimize approaches to prevent and manage heart disease and diabetes in all Canadians, as well as guide future research."

The risks are not equal across all groups of pregnant women, with important differences seen based on income, ethnicity, and where someone lives. Current tools used to predict the risk of negative outcomes in pregnancy only include medical factors, neglecting the social and environmental factors that may contribute to this risk. The creation of a tool that considers both medical and social-environmental factors will significantly enhance healthcare delivery and improve health outcomes for mothers and their infants.  

This research aims to: 1) Describe the prevalence of negative outcomes in pregnancy in Canada and identify key factors relating to an individual's social status, health, and environment that contribute to an increased risk of these outcomes, and 2) Develop and validate a novel tool, the Adverse Pregnancy Outcomes Population Risk Tool (PregPoRT) for mothers (PregPoRT-M) and developing fetuses (PregPoRT-F) to predict this risk.   

I will create a cohort using administrative health databases, combining data from the Canadian Community Health Survey and the Discharge Abstract Database. Environmental factors will also be included from various sources. Using statistical methods, I will identify key factors that increase the risk of negative outcomes in pregnancy and create tools, PregPoRT-M and PregPoRT-F, to predict the risk for mothers and their babies.  

PregPoRT will be used to predict future negative pregnancy outcomes, analyze the impact of specific risk factors, and determine groups at higher risk. This vital information will help health experts and policymakers create targeted programs to improve maternal and infant health, reducing health disparities across communities. As the first tool of its kind, this research stands to make a significant contribution to pregnancy research in Canada."

"Mental health of working seniors in Canada: prevalence, determinants and lived experiences","['Chireh, Batholomew']",['N/A'],['The Working Senior And Mental Health'],6000.0,485636,"This study investigates how work stress, age, work status, and mental health are related to seniors aged 65 or older who are still employed in Canada. The study aims to explore how working in later life affects mental health and to learn from the experiences of seniors with a history of mental health issues. The study uses data from the Canadian Community Health Surveys and includes a sample of 9,170 working seniors and conducted qualitative interviews concerning their lived experiences with mental health while working. The results show that post-retirement work is a protective factor against mental disorders and that older age and full-time work are protective factors for depression and anxiety. However, extreme work stress is a significant determinant of both mental disorders. In addition, our qualitative interviews observed instances of discrimination and stigmatization directed toward individuals with a history of mental health issues. The study highlights several other factors that increase the risk of mental disorders, including being female, single, a smoker, and having multiple health issues. The research suggests that older individuals should be encouraged to work even after retiring, but it is important to ensure that their skills match with less physically demanding job roles. Additionally, it is crucial to implement measures to combat the negative attitudes and unfair treatment that older workers with a history of mental health problems may face in the workplace. The study's findings have implications for policies and interventions aimed at improving the mental health and well-being of seniors in the workforce."

Through interviews with physical activity service providers and people with disabilities, information will be collected about this group's activity experiences and opportunities. The project will focus on identifying physical activity facilitators and barriers. Facilitators are understood to support taking part in physical activity. Barriers are thought to prevent participation in physical activity.

Within the study, of the total 328 participants recruited in BC 236 (72%) reported being food insecure - a level approximately seven times greater than in the general Canadian population. These findings point to the need to move research to action. Because the policy and service contexts are so different within each of the three provinces involved in the study, the dissemination strategies of Nourishing Communities will focus on knowledge translation activities in BC, while sharing the products and learnings with the teams in Ontario and Quebec. Nourishing Communities will implement a strategic approach to bring findings back to communities that participated in the study, including people living with HIV/AIDS, policy makers and community-based organizations, as well as disseminating to academic audiences. This will be achieved through the creation of dissemination products (such as postcards and fact sheets), regionally specific presentations, and articles and presentations for academic audiences. Additionally, we will host a half-day Community Dialogue, where participants will develop a BC Action Plan on HIV/AIDS Food Security.

I will also examine whether there are interactions between ethnicity, immigration status, and the built environment in determining CVD prevalence. I hypothesize that there will be a significant association between the built environment and CVD prevalence even after controlling for individual risk factors. The study population will include approximately 160,000 individuals who participated in the Ontario components of Statistics Canada's National Population Health Surveys (1996) and Canadian Community Health Surveys (2001-2007). Prevalence of CVD will be defined as self-reported heart disease or stroke obtained from survey data. Community-level factors will include area-based socioeconomic status, and three measures of the built environment: neighbourhood-level physical activity friendliness; access to healthy resources (e.g. grocery store, park, or public recreational space); and exposure to healthy vs. unhealthy foods (e.g. grocery stores vs. convenience stores or fast food restaurants). These community-level factors have been developed and validated for discrete neighborhoods in Ontario. The mandate of CIHR is the creation and translation of new knowledge to improve the health of Canadians. The results of this study will be of great value in identifying high-risk communities, informing public health policy, and designing effective population-level prevention strategies in an effort to reduce the significant burden of CVD among Canadians.

CNCP is poorly managed, with medications such as opioids being one of few tools available to family doctors who do not have easy access to multidisciplinary teams. Nonetheless, little good quality data exist on who benefits from opioid therapy or is at risk of opioid abuse. In parallel, the ongoing opioid crisis referring to waves of opioid overdoses in North America has led clinicians and governmental instances to adopt an increasingly conservative approach to the use of opioids. This however is not without consequence for CNCP patients. These elements have led this research team to propose in depth examination of opioid therapy in CNCP patients using a unique methodology that combines Quebec health administrative data banks with an existing registry of 8,650 patients with CNCP (Quebec Pain Registry). While individually none of these data banks can adequately answer certain questions about the impact of opioid crisis on CNCP patients, their combination will provide rich and unique data. Most notably, this pairing will provide accurate and precise information on opioid prescriptions, pain diagnosis, pain severity, quality of life, and mood. We will use advanced statistical methods to (a) identify different patient subgroups who are most and least likely to benefit from opioid therapy and identify predictors of treatment response, (b) examine the frequency and risk factors of opioid doctor shopping behaviors (one form of opioid abuse), and (c) examine the impact of the opioid crisis on opioid prescriptions and related serious adverse events in Quebec. Identifying factors associated with opioid treatment response and risk of abuse can lead to significant improvements in pain management practices and in the condition of CNCP patients while providing a safe and responsible framework for the use of opioids as a therapeutic tool."

Fortunately, the benefits of self-compassion on the mental-health are well-established. The current study will examine the effectiveness of a self-compassion intervention in the hope of reducing the deleterious effects of identity-based bullying (e.g., racial and homophobic bullying) on mental health in a sample of 200 adolescents across high schools in Quebec. 

The study will shed light on the effects of their day-to-day experience with discrimination and the unique challenges they confront due to the interacting systems of oppression (i.e., racism and homophobia). Utilizing an intersectionality approach, this study aims to implement an intervention program that will promote social-emotional well-being and reduce the harmful effects of identity-based bullying among Canadian students. Thus, this research will produce knowledge that promotes action regarding the factors contributing to the mental health disparities among marginalized youth in schools.

Current treatments for dementia provide only limited benefits for people affected by dementia. There is growing interest in evaluating the potential use of medications currently approved by Health Canada to treat conditions other than dementia as potential treatments to prevent or delay the onset of dementia. The concept of using currently available medications for new health conditions has been referred to as drug repurposing. Several types of medications used to treat other health conditions may also slow the progress of Alzheimer's disease or dementia. Early evidence suggests these medications could be ""repurposed"" as treatments to prevent or treat dementia. Given that these medications are frequently prescribed to individuals at risk of developing dementia, there is an opportunity to examine the ""real-world evidence"" for these non-dementia medications as potential dementia treatments using routinely collected health data. Potential medication classes that may be target for drug repurposing include different types of medications used to treat depression and epilepsy. Information on how different patterns of medication use may be related to changes in the risk of dementia may provide new information about the causes of dementia and identify potential treatments that could be evaluated in clinical trials. Our project will use population-based administrative healthcare databases in Alberta to develop a dementia risk index based on known risk factors for dementia. We will then examine how different medications used in the treatment of depression are associated with differences in the rates of dementia development as an example of drug repurposing. This dementia risk index will make it easier to find new ways to treat dementia in the future. This will be done by looking at how exposure to commonly prescribed medications might change the predicted risk of dementia."

To achieve the goal of building healthy cities, it is imperative to empower these diverse communities for enabling them to be their own champions for improvement of health and wellness. Enabling the immigrant communities to build their health data cooperatives has the potential to promote health equity by empowering community members.
Health data cooperative is an emerging concept that provides a digital platform to gather individual health data in one secure place under the ownership of the data-providers. Health data platforms, if organized as cooperatives, will be solely owned and controlled by their respective members to safely store, manage, and share their health-related data with other stakeholders (e.g. research communities, commercial entities, government bodies), and can be more effective in the active participation of the community members.

Through our community-engaged initiatives to identify community-prioritized issues to work on, health literacy is an issue that the community members identified as a priority to work further on. Focusing on health literacy of immigrants in Canada is particularly important, as many immigrants are from countries with languages and/or cultures which are different from Canada. During our informal stakeholder consultations, we identified the possibility of engaging the International Medical Graduates (IMG) from the immigrant communities in the work around health literacy. IMGs are immigrants who have completed their medical education and/or training outside of Canada. Majority of the immigrant communities in Canada includes IMGs and they can provide tremendous value through the possible roles they can play towards improved community health literacy. We are proposing to build further on our budding collaboration and develop capacity by undertaking a project focusing on community based health literacy improvement initiatives through IMGs."

Equitable involvement includes people with lived experience and knowledge users as part of research process. While community-based participatory research approach outlines this path, there are shortcomings in its application, especially for research with the racialized / immigrant communities. Much of the research in the racialized / immigrant populations take place where community members are not strongly involved in decision making capacities for establishing goals, identifying research questions, and determining the research process and outcomes. Building on Social Justice Theory and Community-engaged Scholarship, we plan to work toward optimal, ethical, systemic, and replicable strategies and practices towards equitable and empowered involvement of racialized immigrant communities in research. Through this planning grant, we will build on existing community relationships, SPOs, and our cross-sectoral partners with synthesized knowledge on how equitable and empowered research with racialized immigrant communities has been being done to date.

Contributions of household income on the longitudinal associations between the built environment and walking,"['Christie, Chelsea D']",['N/A'],"['Built Environment', 'Neighbourhood Design', 'Physical Activity', 'Population Health']",150000.0,396336,"Background: The design of modern cities may be leading to decreases in population levels of physical activity. Cross-sectional studies suggest that neighbourhood built environment characteristics, including street design patterns, types of destinations nearby, and overall walkability are associated with physical activity. However, these studies may be biased by self-selection (individuals choosing a neighbourhood matched to their physical activity preferences). One way to address this limitation is to use residential relocation studies, which measure people's physical activity before and after they move neighbourhoods. Most of this research has examined people from high income backgrounds; therefore, very little is known about the effects for lower income people.  
Research aim: To examine whether changes in neighbourhood walkability impact walking and whether this relationship differs according to household income. 
Method: Study 1 will be a literature review of built environment and physical activity residential relocation studies that consider income. Study 2 will be a residential relocation study of people with diverse incomes from a longitudinal study. Study 3 will focus on a low income population by following people as they move into affordable housing. Both Study 2 & 3 will have questionnaire items measuring walking, demographic, and health characteristics. Using spatial data, we will create walkability scores for participants' postal codes to group participants by relocation status (i.e., increased walkability, decreased walkability, no change, or no relocation). Statistical models will test if changes in walkability resulted in changes in walking and how income affects this relationship.
Implications: These studies will provide novel and rigorous evidence regarding the role of income in the relationship between built characteristics and physical activity. These results could influence urban design policy to positively impact population health."

However, the exact nature of the relationship between ultra fine particles (UFP) and its impact on development of lung function and asthma in children is still not fully understood.

In this paper we aim to use the Toronto cohort from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study combined with ultra fine particle data of Toronto over the period of 2008-2014 to identify and describe both acute and longitudinal effects of UFP on children. The outcomes measured are the development of lung functions over time and asthma. Bayesian modeling is applied to particle data to simulate spread and time trend and validated with reference data at key time points. The resulting particulate measurement is then applied to regression models to estimate the effects of UFP on PFT measurements. Logistic regression model is used to estimate the impact of UFP on development of childhood asthma."

However, concerns about ethical, societal, and legal implications arise as these technologies transform private homes into surveillance and health monitoring systems. Additionally, digital ageism, the age-related bias in technology development, can exacerbate health disparities for OAs. To address these concerns, a planning grant proposes to bring together experts from different fields, including policymakers, researchers, and OAs, to identify research priorities on the impact of smart home technologies and digital ageism on OAs' lives.

However, LGB suicidal risk and quality of care is under-researched in Canada and worldwide. Current studies typically use convenience samples and solely rely on self-reported data, which leads to limited generalizability and survival bias (i.e. only survivors can participate in surveys). As a result, we currently lack population-based estimates of the SRB disparity by sexual orientation based on clinical & mortality data. Our project will fill this evidentiary gap using a large population-based retrospective cohort study with validated clinical and mortality measures (through linked health administrative datasets), providing the strong evidence that are vitally important for prioritising the funding of programs to reduce LGB suicidal behaviours. Our project will also address the lack of research on the quality of care of LGB people who suffer from SRB, which is an important factor in preventing further suicidal behaviours. 
The LGB population suffers from unique mental health challenges due to discrimination and uneven distribution of LGB-specific stressors/resources, which the dominant biomedical research paradigm does not adequately address. Our proposed study addresses these gaps by generating and testing hypotheses on the socio-environmental determinants of LGB SRB risk and care. Using longitudinal clinical, mortality, and geospatial data, our project will answer the following research questions: 1) Are there differences in the prevalence of SRB by sexual orientation in the Canadian context? And if so, do socio-environmental factors influence the SRB disparity by sexual orientation? 2)Does the quality of care for those at risk of SRB differ by sexual orientation? And if so, are there geographical variations in the disparities?"

In 2022 alone, over 300 anti-trans bills targeting gender identity and expression, and restrictions on trans human rights, were introduced in the United States, along with rising transphobic public sentiment in Canada. Prior research indicate that trans individuals suffer from greater risk of self-harm (i.e. self-injury, self-poisoning, and suicide attempts), and exposure to discrimination and stigma may worsen psychosocial stress and increase the risk of self-harm.  The proposed project aims to 1) study the disparity in self-harm related deaths and acute-care use among different gender identities (cis women, cis men, transmasculine, transfeminine, and non-binary); 2) investigate the effect of trans-specific policies and access to gender-affirming healthcare on self-harm among transgender individuals, as well as differences in follow-up care after a crisis event (such as a suicide attempt); and 3) gather the perspectives of trans and non-binary individuals to inform public and health policies. 

Our project will provide Canadian social service providers and community organizations with the strong evidence on self-harm disparity by gender identity, which is vitally important for prioritising the funding of programs to reduce self-harm events. As our project  was formulated based on the needs of our community partners, which includes LGBTQ2S+ healthcare and advocacy organisations, we will collaborate with them to integrate the research  findings into their core activities and strategies to reduce trans self-harm especially among trans people at the intersections of multiple disadvantages. By providing evidence on the impact of trans-targeted public policies and gender-affirming healthcare on self-harm, the research will also contribute to the wider social and political debates on the need to promote trans-human rights in Canada and internationally."

Norway House Cree Nation is a remote, northern community with a strong interest in returning birthing services to the community. This research will explore the social, cultural and clinical feasibility of birth repatriation in First Nations communities, with a specific focus on Norway House. This will be done by exploring the attitudes of primary care staff and the community, the experiences of Norway House women who have left the community to birth as well as the experiences of women who have given birth in the community since prior to 1970 and in recent years, and the clinical feasibility of supporting low risk mothers and their neonates in the community and the subsequent costs of evacuation."

Food sovereignty, while a separate concept from food security, is certainly aligned. In an Indigenous setting, Indigenous food sovereignty (IFS) is often contextualized in remote, rural communities. However, elements of food sovereignty also exist for urban Indigenous communities. Food and culture are inextricably linked. Cultural food, from growing and harvesting to preparing requires a connection to traditional culture. For inner city youth, it can be challenging to access cultural food, but also to access the skills and knowledge around the practice of acquiring and processing it. This paper will explore how prolonged participation in a variety of land based and urban activities centered around traditional food skills and grounded in principles of Indigenous food sovereignty impacts the self-esteem and cultural identity of Indigenous youth living in Winnipeg's inner city. Specifically, we will be exploring: the relationship that Indigenous youth in Winnipeg's inner city have with their cultural food; how participation in cultural activities centered around cultural food impacts their identity and how they value themselves as Indigenous youth in the city; and the ways organizations and schools can use principles of Indigenous food sovereignty as a basis for cultural identity development and subsequently positive personal development for youth."

However, the effectiveness of school-based population health interventions on addressing the health inequities faced by LGBTQ youth is a largely underdeveloped area of research. The objective of this investigation is to compare the effectiveness of arts-involved and non-arts-involved strategies in reducing homophobia and increasing school connectedness, and to learn from youth perspectives about attributes that make specific interventions more effective or less effective. 

This study will be conducted in secondary schools where interventions are implemented to address homophobia and school connectedness.

Among trans youth, it was found that only 15% were 'very comfortable' discussing their trans status with their doctor and nearly half (47%) of older youth had forgone needed physical care in previous year. A third (33%) of younger youth had forgone needed physical care and two thirds (68%) had forgone necessary mental health care in the previous year. Reasons for not accessing care included not wanting parents to know, thinking or hoping the problem would go away, being afraid of what the doctor might say or do, previous negative experiences, and not knowing where to go. 

Findings indicate that trans youth in Canada experience barriers in accessing not only trans-specific care (e.g. puberty suppression, hormone therapy), but also basic physical and mental health care. Connections between health care access and health outcomes, as well as implications for improving personal and population health through improvements to Canadian health care systems will be discussed."

Proposed activities will focus on the planning and development of an Indigenous-led, community-based project using the methodological framework of Steseptekwle-Secwepemc storytelling and Red Intersectionality (Clark, 2016). The grant will support relationship building and knowledge sharing within two Indigenous communities (Urban Secwepemc in Vancouver, BC and Secwepmec in Chase, BC), connecting community members, knowledge keepers, and elders.  The project will create space for dialogue and demonstrate the ways in which we are reinstating our Secwepemc wellbeing and healing praxis through everyday acts of decolonial love, relationship and kinship. Previous research (Clark, 2018; Jules, 2016; Michel, 2012; Billy, 2009) demonstrated that family and community structures were and continue to be taught through Indigenous story, mentorship/apprenticeship, and ceremony, thus the current project would further explore these as ways to share concepts of gender and wellness. For example, within Secwepemc communities, gender, puberty and relationships are introduced and discussed through the Story of Sockeye Salmon, first by teaching of the life cycle, then for preparing to become parents, and the role of the parents and taking care of each other to support the healthy development of children. Embedded within this story and other stories are teachings that discuss gender and family roles, as well as roles within the larger environment. Concepts include respect for each other, sharing, and giving back.  Through this planning grant there is an opportunity to  focus on Secwepemc concepts of gender and wellness through an intergenerational approach that supports healthy transitions across the lifespan."

Comparing healthy public policies: Active transportation policies in Montreal and Toronto,"['Clavier, Carole', 'Gagnon, France']","['Gower, Stephanie', 'Macfarlane, Ronald', 'Paquin, Sophie', 'Vaillancourt, Normand', 'Bilodeau, Angèle', 'Divay, Gérard', 'Poland, Blake D', 'Savan, Beth I']","['Active Transportation', 'Comparison', 'Healthy Public Policy', 'Implementation Study', 'Intersectoral Action', 'Policy Process', 'Population Health Intervention', 'Qualitative Research', 'Urban Policy']",,302641,"This project will study the on-going implementation of the active transportation policies of the cities of Montreal and Toronto. Walking or cycling to work, the grocery store or the medical clinic are examples of active transportation. It is a trend in urban mobility that major Canadian cities have sought to encourage over the last decade because of its many potentially positive impacts on urban populations. For instance, active transportation can help reduce traffic congestion, mitigate the impact of climate change, improve social cohesion and, not least, improve the health of urban populations. It increases rates of physical activity and thus contributes to reducing risks of obesity and related cancers, heart and lungs diseases, diabetes, high pressure and depression. The cities of Montreal and Toronto have been developing active transportation policies since the early 2000s. The current revision of their development and transportation plans shows that there is an increased interest for active transportation in these cities today. However, just like other cities around the world, Montreal and Toronto are faced with considerable challenges at the implementation stage of their policies. Our goal is to understand the conditions and processes that support the implementation of active transportation policies so as to be able to support the creation and implementation of these and other urban policies that can have a positive impact on health. Based on political science knowledge on public policies and the policy process, we shall study the role of the actors (public, private, NGOs, citizens, municipal councillors) from several policy areas (transportation, public health, sustainable development or urban planning) who contributed to the agenda setting and implementation of the policies. Our hypothesis is that changes among these actors -who defend specific interests and ideas- between the agenda setting and implementation stages might explain implementation challenges."

Understanding urban policies for health as the interconnection between several policy subsystems,"['Clavier, Carole']",['N/A'],"['Health In All Policies', 'Public Policy Studies', 'Qualitative Research', 'Walking And Cycling']",2500.0,337279,"Public health officials and academics around the world are promoting the use of municipal healthy public policies to improve population health. Building and implementing such policies is a challenging endeavour involving the horizontal management of intersectoral units; the layering of several orders of government whose jurisdictions meet on the urban space; asserting the legitimacy of integrating health into policies concerned with other areas of action. To better support population health interventions at the municipal level, we need research that deepens our understanding of urban governance processes that involve a variety of policy sectors (e.g., urban planning, transportation and public health) and actors (e.g., NGOs, activist, public, private and politicians). In this paper, we contend that urban policies for health develop at the conjunction of several policy subsystems in that they cut across several areas of municipal responsibilities. A key to developing urban policies for health would therefore be to strengthen the links between all the subsystems concerned. 
Our argument is based on the study of policies that promote walking and cycling as means of transportation within the cities of Montreal and Toronto. Active transportation policy develops at the junction of transportation, public transit, urban development, sports and leisure, and public health. The ability to involve actors from all these policy subsystems is key to the success of urban policies for health."
From languishing to flourishing: a mixed-methods approach to operationalizing maternal and child complete mental health and associated risk and resiliency factors,"['Clayborne, Zahra']",['N/A'],"['Adolescence', 'Child Development', 'Flourishing', 'Maternal-Child Health', 'Mental Health', 'Psychiatry', 'Resilience', 'Wellbeing']",135000.0,471966,"Mental health lies on a spectrum from languishing, which involves feelings of low mood, emptiness, and low wellbeing, to flourishing or complete mental health, which involves the absence of mental illness and the presence of high wellbeing. Flourishing mental health is linked to lower risk of several mental and physical illnesses, and importantly, can be improved even in the presence of mental illness through methods including psychological treatments. Targeting flourishing mental health early in life is important, as approximately half of all mental illnesses begin before 18 years of age. Research also suggests that children of mothers dealing with mental illness are more likely to experience mental illness themselves, further demonstrating the need for prevention and intervention approaches that address mental health across the lifespan. Most mental health research involves the study of mental illness or languishing, and its associated risk and protective factors. Given limited research focus on flourishing, there are few tools that exist to examine the complete spectrum of mental health among mothers and children. The aim of this research project is to define flourishing and languishing mental health and examine the factors that predict flourishing and languishing using innovative statistical methods and existing data from the All Our Families (AOF) study, as well as through the collection of data using focus group research on select AOF participants. By measuring flourishing and languishing outcomes and their potential predictors in mothers and their children, this research will identify how those at-risk are able to flourish throughout life, including during periods of substantial life stress, such as the COVID-19 pandemic."

Most people in Zambia are poor, but the country is developing which is seeing some Zambians becoming prosperous. Among Zambians, those with disabilities are among the poorest because of the lack of opportunities that they face.

Rehabilitation is a strategy that aims to equalize opportunities for persons with disabilities. Rehabilitation could help Zambians with disabilities improve their quality of life, but there currently very little rehabilitation in the country. 

We think that rehabilitation should be developed in Zambia, but want to ensure that this happens in ways that meet the needs of Zambians with disabilities. In order to do this, we will do research to find out exactly what the needs of Zambians with disabilities are. We will work together with partners in Zambia, especially persons with disabilities, to learn about how Zambians understand disability, to find out what Zambians know about rehabilitation and to see how Zambians decide what is most important to them.

The results of this research will be shared both in Zambia and internationally. This research can help Zambia develop a stronger rehabilitation system and also help us understand disability and rehabilitation better everywhere."
Early Life Exposures to Wildfire Smoke and Respiratory Health Outcomes During Childhood,"['Cleland, Stephanie E', 'Henderson, Sarah']","['Brigham, Emily P', 'Lavigne, Éric', 'Nicol, Anne-Marie', 'To, Teresa']","['Acute And Chronic Respiratory Outcomes', 'Administrative Health Data', 'Air Pollution', 'Childhood Respiratory Health', 'Climate Change', 'Early Life Exposures', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Population-Based Study', 'Prenatal Exposures', 'Wildfire Smoke']",294526.0,502452,"Wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense across Canada, in part due to climate change. Inhaling wildfire smoke (WFS) can damage the lungs, cause respiratory infections, and trigger asthma symptoms. Studies suggest that exposure to WFS during early life (i.e., exposure in the womb, as infants, and as young children) may lead to more respiratory problems in childhood. The goal of our study is to better understand how both occasional and prolonged exposure to WFS throughout early life affects respiratory outcomes in the first 8 years of life. We will evaluate whether the timing and amount of WFS exposure experienced matters and if there are certain children who are more at risk. Because British Columbia (BC) has wildfires every summer in different parts of the province, children in BC experience varying amounts of WFS exposure during childhood depending on where they live and when they were born. This variability makes BC the ideal location to study the childhood respiratory impacts of early life WFS exposure. Our study will extend follow-up of an existing cohort of ~160,000 BC children, born between 2016-2019, by 7 years. These children were exposed to four of the most severe wildfire seasons in BC's recorded history (2017, 2018, 2021, 2023). We will use data from health administrative databases to assess whether, when, and how much WFS exposure in early life is related to having more lung infections and asthma attacks by age 8. We anticipate that early life exposure to WFS will lead to poorer lung health in childhood and that the children who experienced more frequent and higher exposure will have worse outcomes. We also expect that WFS will have a larger impact during certain periods of early life and that children's vulnerability to WFS will depend on personal characteristics such as sex and socioeconomic status. We will use these findings to inform public health messaging, decision-making, and strategies to better protect children during future WFS events."

Health is affected by genetics, personal behaviour, medical treatment, and - most of all - the environment in which people live and work. As a result of social policies that affect factors influencing health, such as income and employment, people burdened by lower education, poorer food quality, inadequate housing and other disadvantages live less healthy and shorter lives.

In Canada, provinces and territories are responsible for the management and delivery of health services, including public health, the part of the health system that promotes health and prevents disease. Public health has leadership to ensure health of whole communities. Because of this, provincial and territorial public health decision-makers have central roles to help the  Government of Canada achieve a pledge it made in 2012 to reduce the gap between the least and most healthy. 

The proposed event, to be held May 29-30, 2014, will help provincial and territorial public health decision makers take a more pivotal role in improving policies and practices, and indirectly impact the activities of local and regional health authorities. The planned event will bring together public health leaders with researchers who specialize in learning about ways that public health systems can help narrow the gap in health status, and improve the overall health of the Canadian population. 

The meeting will be made up of three segments: 1) education about research findings that will help provincial and territorial public health decision-makers better set priorities, use policy levers and assign resources; 2) sharing among public health leaders about promising and proven mechanisms being tested in different provinces and territories; and 3) identifying knowledge gaps and planning next steps to continue networking and support for policy, program and practice improvements to advance health equity."
De la perte de contrôle alimentaire au trouble d'accès hyperphagique : trajectoires évolutives et facteurs de risque.,"['Clermont, Camille']",['N/A'],"['Comportements Alimentaires', 'Dysfonctionnement Exécutif', 'Sensibilité À La Récompense', ""Trouble D'Accès Hyperphagique"", 'Émotions Négatives']",105000.0,496688,"Le trouble d'accès hyperphagique (TAH) est le trouble des conduites alimentaires le plus répandu, sa prévalence à vie s'estimant à 2,42% chez les femmes et à 1,17% chez les hommes (Qian et al., 2021). Le TAH se caractérise principalement par la présence d'épisodes récurrents de surconsommation alimentaire incontrôlée, communément appelées les accès hyperphagiques. Il tend à se manifester principalement à l'adolescence ou au seuil de l'âge adulte, généralement entre 16 et 20 ans (Stice et al., 2013). Des études récentes suggèrent qu'un aspect central du TAH, soit la sensation de perdre le contrôle en mangeant, serait identifiable dès l'enfance ou l'adolescence (Tanofsky-Kraff et al., 2020). Toutefois, les mécanismes sous-jacents menant de la perte de contrôle vers le TAH demeurent largement méconnus. Dans ce contexte, des chercheurs proposent un modèle théorique qui lie le développement du TAH chez les adultes à la perte de contrôle alimentaire à l'enfance et à l'adolescence (Tanofsky-Kraff et al., 2020). Cependant, à ce jour, la validation prospective et empirique du modèle n'a pas encore été réalisée. Ainsi, le but principal du projet est d'examiner l'évolution de la perte de contrôle alimentaire chez les jeunes, en se basant sur le modèle de Tanofsky-Kraff et son équipe (2020). Au terme de cette étude, il est attendu que des indicateurs plus clairs pour identifier les jeunes à risque de développer un TAH soient disponibles pour les intervenants. De plus, des recommandations préliminaires sur les services à offrir seront émises. Des webinaires seront également organisés pour présenter les résultats de recherche, lesquels seront ensuite disponibles sur les sites web de plusieurs partenaires communautaires et du réseau de la santé. Enfin, ce projet jettera les bases pour le développement futur d'un programme d'autosoins visant à prévenir le TAH. D'ailleurs, une intervention préventive sera proposée via un site web éducatif existant (www.compulsionalimentaire.ca)."

Dementia is a global public health issue that has a major impact on social, economic and health care systems, and on people and their families in all countries. It is estimated that by 2040 almost three-quarters of all people with dementia will be living in developing countries, a situation that has so far been neglected by international funding agencies. Most Canadian provinces have developed a plan and/or a strategy to guide interventions for dementia. In the Caribbean, initiatives and information regarding ARD are scarce. Therefore collaboration between researchers from Canada and the Caribbean would ultimately benefit the health of populations and health care services for older people in both regions since: 1) the participating Caribbean institutions would develop their dementia agenda and care and research capabilities whilst the Canadian; 2) there are important migration flows from the Caribbean to Canada especially Quebec and Ontario provinces; and 3) research conducted in the Caribbean could improve knowledge about the complexity of dementia in aging as well as informing Canadian researchers, health and social professionals and policy makers on special care needs of older Canadian immigrants with dementia."
Examining the role of sexual relationship power inequity on multi-levelled drivers of HIV vulnerability for young women in an HIV hyper-endemic setting of South Africa,"['Closson, Kalysha']",['N/A'],"['Adolescent And Young Adults', 'Gender Equity', 'Gender-Transformative', 'Global Health', 'Hiv Prevention', 'Interdisciplinary', 'Relationship Power', 'Social Determinants Of Health', 'South Africa', 'Young Women']",150000.0,376207,"On average 2,000 young women (YW) in South Africa acquire HIV every week, representing the highest new infection rates globally. Emerging research has begun to examine and act upon the multiple-intersecting factors that place YW at increased risk for HIV. High-levels of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and immature vaginal lining make YW more biologically susceptible to HIV. HIV risk for YW is also elevated due to social factors. Our previous work has found that YW experience high-levels of sexual relationship power inequity (SRPI), which compromises their agency to negotiate safe sex, impacts mental health, and heightens their risk of STIs/HIV. Evidence is needed to examine how socio-relational factors intersect with biological risk. As such, this proposed research seeks to examine and explore measures of SRPI and how SRPI influences biological, relational, and structural HIV vulnerabilities for YW growing-up within HIV hyper-endemic settings. Using prospective data from a youth-centered sexual reproductive health study conducted among South African youth aged 16-24 over an 18-month period, the objectives of this proposal are to 1) examine how SRPI influences STI treatment uptake, partner notification and STI incidence, 2) explore the pathway from SRPI to heightened biological susceptibility through it's influence on markers of stress and inflammation and 3) explore how SRPI is measured, conceived and influences the sexual decision-making practices and health-seeking behaviours of young men and women. As international targets aim to achieve an AIDS-free generation by 2030, this research merging biological and socio-behavioural data to examine the factors impacting heightened HIV-risk for YW living at the epicentre of the HIV epidemic is extremely timely. Moreover, the proposed research is in line with and can be used to inform the Canadian governments new feminist approach to international aid that prioritizes advancing and promoting equal rights for women."

As such, in rural areas, young girls are often removed from school to get married at a young age or enter into sex work. Those from scheduled tribes and castes, such as the Devadasi caste, are particularly affected. Less education, early child marriage and early entry into sex work all result in an increased risk of acquiring HIV and other negative sexual and reproductive health outcomes. Another effect of under-valuing young girls is 'eve-teasing' -harassment in schools by young boys. As a result, young women are more likely to drop out of school. This proposed research supplements an existing intervention that aims to shift individual and community-level gender roles and norms among young girls, young boys and their families, with the goal of reducing school drop-out and helping young girls gain equal access to quality education. Using mixed methods, including previously-collected survey data at baseline and follow-up, as well as qualitative focus groups, this proposed research will examine how shifts in gender norms over the intervention period will help reduce school drop out. This research will also focus on the success of the intervention in shifting harmful gender norms among young men and the impact this has on eve-teasing and school drop out. This aligns with Canada's commitment to feminizing international efforts to create gender equality and empower women and girls. Working with an international team of adolescent, sexual and reproductive health experts will ensure results from this research help to inform local, national and international efforts to reduce HIV transmission, improve gender equity and the health and well being of vulnerable young girls in India."

Despite these advances, some priority populations living with HIV continue to face disproportionate health outcomes and shortened life expectancies. The number of WLHIV in Canada is increasing. Previous research has demonstrated that intimate partner violence (IPV) is a driver of HIV acquisition and poor HIV outcomes among women globally. Few studies have examined the multiple interacting effect of IPV on the overall wellbeing and survival of WLHIV in a setting where HIV treatment is available at no cost. Using data from a longitudinal cohort of people living with HIV in the province of British Columbia, we examined the prevalence and cofactors of multiple forms of IPV (emotional, physical, and sexual). Among 251 WLHIV included in the study, we found 150 (60%) had experienced any lifetime IPV, while 63 (25%) had experienced both physical and sexual IPV in their life. Lifetime experiences of any IPV and both sexual and physical IPV was associated with a history of potentially problematic drinking as well as a diagnosis of depression. Although multivariable models found no association between any IPV or sexual and physical IPV and mortality, the proportion of WLHIV who experienced any IPV and both sexual and physical IPV was higher than WLHIV who did not experience IPV. During the study period a history of a depression diagnosis was associated with shortened survival among WLHIV. This study highlights a potential pathway between IPV, depression and mortality among a highly marginalized cohort of WLHIV. In order to reduce disproportionately high proportion of deaths experienced by WLHIV, future efforts should seek to prevent IPV and ensure trauma and violence aware care is provided for WLHIV."

Much of the work centred on improving gender equity and health has been geared towards adults, or early adolescents (aged 10-14), has focused on either women or men, but not both, is not intersectional, and has been conducted through a deficit-based lens measuring gender inequitable attitudes, with few studies focused on measuring positive norm change among youth. As such, efforts to improve gender equity need to address data gaps so to better understand, monitor, and improve sexual and relationship norms using participatory and strength-based approaches that can have positive implications for young women and men across the life course. The objectives of this program of research are: 1) To create a youth participatory method for gender equity measurement development via a youth advisory committee; 2) To identify current measures of youth sexual and relationship norms via a systematic review and critique of the literature in collaboration with the youth advisory committee; and 3) To develop and test new strength-based measures of youth sexual and relationship norms using the participatory approach. This participatory approach to gender equity measurement development will use multiple methods including qualitative cognitive interviewing, item development, pilot testing, and psychometric analyses and scale item refinement tested within ongoing quantitative youth sexual and reproductive health surveys. All methods will aim to ensure the newly developed scale is modified to reflect the living realities of diverse youth in Canada, India, South Africa, and the United States. Ultimately, this study will inform best practice for measuring gender equity to advance the sexual and reproductive health and rights of youth globally."

It represented almost 2000 fatalities and 10 000 serious injuries in Canada in 2014, with an annual social cost measured in tens of billions of dollars. Combined with a recent noticeable rise in urban road casualties (especially vulnerable road users), Canada's road safety strategy 2025 entitled ""Towards Zero: the Safest Roads in the World"" led to a Vision Zero movement in most major Canadian cities. Edmonton, Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto and Montreal all adopted this approach in 2016 while other major cities are considering its adoption.
Within the Vision Zero approach, no loss of life is acceptable. This approach, first introduced almost 20 year ago in Sweden, was a turning point in the way countries and cities view road safety. In short, the idea is to intervene upstream, at the level of the road design and to do so by including key players from many expertise related to road safety. As Canadian cities position themselves in line with the Vision Zero approach, the need to evaluate both the process and the outcomes in the upcoming years has become apparent. Therefore, this planning grant has two objectives: 1) To better understand the Vision Zero strategy around the world through a systematic literature review; 2) To document operations and dynamics of Vision Zero approaches in Canada through interviews with key stakeholders in participating cities.
Expected outcomes from this grant are twofold. First, it will be the opportunity for key players to share their knowledge regarding the implementation and the evaluation of the Vision Zero approach, therefore helping to bridge practice and research expectations for future collaborations. Secondly, the information gathered will be the basis of a full grant application on the assessment of the Vision Zero approach as a promising intersectoral action for population health improvement."

Along with the tracking of the implementation process and the assessment of how and where interventions are implemented, we will examine multiple outcomes of speed reduction including injuries prevented, increases in active transportation and livable neighbourhoods. This work will encompass different urban contexts with an equity lens across ages and deprivation.

Effects of Self-Knowledge on Self-Regulation and Healthy Eating,"['Clowater, Sarah L']",['N/A'],"['Health Behaviours', 'Healthy Eating', 'Obesity', 'Psychology Of Health']",17500.0,201067,"Many people in Canada today suffer from diseases of lifestyle (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, obesity) and participate in activities that are known to be detrimental to one's health (e.g., smoking, eating fried foods). This project investigates the psychological factors that can affect one's ability to self-regulate, or monitor and control their health-related behaviours (e.g., healthy eating). Understanding psychological factors that influence self-regulation can help develop behaviour change implementations with clients one-on-one in a clinical setting and also population health interventions so more people can practice healthy eating, which would reduce rates of obesity, type II diabetes and so on."

If the world of science is having trouble understanding the terms, then is it surprising that the general public is confused? So what is there to be confused about? ""Sex"" refers to biological differences between men and women. ""Gender"" refers to the socially constructed roles and behaviours, activities that society considers acceptable for men and women. While these may seem like straightforward definitions, it starts to get messy again when we try to understand why sex and gender matter. This presentation will provide a relaxed and interactive opportunity for the general public to hear leaders in the field of sex, gender and health explain, using non-scientific language, why both matter for our health and wellbeing."

They are not in a position to negotiate condom use due to poverty, lack of education, and experiences of gender violence and this increases the likelihood of HIV transmission. We are carrying out an intervention to improve young women's access to government support programs that will help alleviate poverty, and allow young women to make choices to protect themselves. We are developing a new way of reaching out to them that makes use of their social networks to identify vulnerable young women and spread information to them. The proposed work for this grant will bring together young women, decision makers, and members of our research team to discuss the results of our work to date with regards to reaching young women effectively, and also to co-design more effective ways of reaching out to this vulnerable population."

Adolescent sexual and reproductive health (ASRH) indicators are worse in the north of the country, including in Bauchi State, where the cultural context limits open discussion of the issues.

Over the last five years, a partnership of CIET/PRAM from McGill University, a Nigerian NGO (Federation of Muslim Women Association of Nigeria) in Bauchi State, and the Bauchi State Primary Health Care Development Agency implemented and demonstrated impact of a program of universal home visits for improving health of mothers and children. The partnership also explored the sensitive issue of child-spacing and co-designed with stakeholders culturally safe interventions to support child-spacing. This work has built trust between researchers and local leadership and communities.

This ASRH project uses a participatory approach involving stakeholders throughout. Stakeholders (including adolescents, parents, service providers and planners) will map their concepts of adolescent sexual and reproductive health risks. This will inform an instrument to collect information from adolescents and parents in households, and local service delivery institutions. Working with adolescents, we will create materials such as video dramas to share findings with stakeholders in communities and services. Local researchers will support stakeholders to plan and to implement local culturally acceptable actions to improve ASRH. We will measure the short-term impact of these actions qualitatively, through stories from stakeholders, and quantitatively in a repeat survey.

In a final phase, the research partnership will disseminate the findings more widely, and support Bauchi state planners and policy makers to develop evidence-based policies and strategies to improve ASRH."
A longitudinal investigation of cannabis use for symptom management among people living with HIV in Canada: Examining changes in the correlates of medical cannabis authorization from pre- to post-legalization of nonmedical cannabis and the role of self-medication processes in risk for cannabis-related harms,"['Coelho, Sophie']",['N/A'],"['Cannabis Legalization', 'Cannabis Use', 'Ecological Momentary Assessment', 'Hiv', 'Longitudinal Research', 'Medical Cannabis Authorization', 'Self-Medication']",105000.0,497158,"Cannabis use is markedly elevated among people living with HIV (PLWH), reflecting widespread use of cannabis to manage physical and mental health symptoms in this population. Although many PLWH who use cannabis to manage symptoms do so with medical cannabis authorization (MCA), the 2018 legalization of nonmedical cannabis in Canada has ostensibly diverted some PLWH toward nonmedical cannabis sources given barriers to accessing MCA. Thus, the correlates of MCA may have changed from pre- to post-legalization. The self-medication hypothesis posits that using cannabis to manage symptoms with limited medical supervision could lead to riskier cannabis use patterns, and in turn, greater cannabis-related harms. However, no research has longitudinally examined pre- and post-legalization correlates of MCA, nor the role of self-medication processes in cannabis outcomes among PLWH in a post-legalization context. My doctoral research will help to fill these critical knowledge gaps. Using more than 20 years of longitudinal data from the Ontario HIV Treatment Network Cohort Study, Study 1 will examine the within- and between-person clinical, cannabis-use-related, and sociodemographic correlates of MCA among PLWH who use cannabis to manage symptoms, both pre- and post-legalization. Study 2 will use ecological momentary assessment to collect real-time data on cannabis use in the daily lives of PLWH, from which self-medication processes characterizing cannabis use without MCA among PLWH in the post-legalization environment will be examined. The proposed research will identify how the clinical correlates of using cannabis to manage symptoms with versus without MCA among PLWH have shifted amid a dynamic legal landscape, informing medical cannabis policy. Further, in elucidating the role of self-medication processes in risk for cannabis-related harms, this work can inform interventions that reduce barriers to accessing cannabis-related medical guidance for PLWH."
Barriers and Facilitators of Physical Activity: Investigating the Role of Gender in Gym Environments,"['Coen, Stephanie']",['N/A'],"['Exercise Behaviour', 'Gender And Health', 'Health Behaviour', 'Health Geography', 'Physical Activity', 'Qualitative Health Research', 'Social Context Of Health']",105000.0,307823,"Physical inactivity is estimated to account for 9% of all premature deaths in Canada and cost the Canadian health care system approximately $6.8 billion per year. If more Canadians engaged in regular physical activity, the benefits to Canadian society would be enormous. Yet, increasing participation in physical activity requires more than a one-size-fits-all solution: Canadian men are more active than women, more likely to be moderately active in their leisure time, and fare better than women in all categories of fitness, except flexibility. When women and men pursue leisure-time physical activities, types of activity differ by gender. Understanding the unique barriers to physical activity faced by women and men is essential for developing effective strategies to promote and support all Canadians in being more active. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the relationships between gendered factors and physical activity in a common, everyday exercise context: the gym. While gyms present opportunities for exercise, they can also reinforce gender differences and stereotypes. Routine training areas, namely free-weight and cardiovascular rooms, are known to be respectively perceived as masculine and feminine spaces for their seeming correspondence with types of workouts required to produce idealized muscular and thin physiques. This study uses in-depth qualitative techniques, including observation, interviews, and focus groups, to examine gym environments and the experiences of gym users. Findings will support the identification of gender-sensitive ways to support regular physical activity engagement."

Given that gender disparities in physical activity begin early in life, intervening in environmental factors that can help level the gender playing field among youth is important for physical activity equity across the life course. Research shows that boys and girls use and perceive spaces differently for physical activity, but stops short of asking youth directly about how gender matters for their physical activity participation in everyday environments (i.e., home, neighbourhoods, schools, parks). The aim of this study is to centre youth perspectives to identify environmental contributors to inequities in physical activity participation among boys and girls. This study involves an in-depth participatory project with children in the London-Middlesex region of Ontario. Over the course of a school year, a series of activity-based focus groups from contrasting urban and rural areas will meet at least 5 times to allow an iterative process for youth to reflect on and interrogate study findings in each subsequent meeting. Focus groups will be centred on creative activities, such as co-creating illustrated short stories or comic strips, to facilitate youth engagement and collaboration. A key outcome is a summative creative product co-created with youth that will be used to share findings with members of the community (e.g., local recreation programmers, city planners, school officials, parents). Understanding how environments may differentially ""afford"" children opportunities for physical activity is key to providing high-quality, supportive environments for activities that can compete with more sedentary options. By centring youth experiences, this study will identify environmental features implicated in gendered inequities in physical activity, which can inform interventions to set up more equitable opportunities into adulthood."

The Ontario Ministry of Health Promotion, through the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, assembled a Scientific Advisory Committee (SAC) in 2009 to synthesize the evidence and make recommendations for a renewed tobacco strategy to improve the health of the population. The SAC delivered its report in April, 2010.  The Ontario Ministry of Health Promotion is now developing a comprehensive tobacco control strategy expected to begin its rollout in 2011.

The SAC report recommended that the new tobacco strategy address the problem of widespread availability of tobacco products in the retail environment.  However, the committee recognized that additional research is required to determine the best way to implement this intervention.  The proposed research addresses this need by systematically and in a timely manner analyzing and evaluating options for reducing the number of tobacco retail outlets.  A series of policy option papers will examine the advantages, expected impacts and possible unintended consequences of three interventions for reducing the number of tobacco retail outlets (licensing system, zoning law, and designated tobacco retail outlets).  These policy papers will feed into the deliberations of an Expert Panel which will produce evidence-informed recommendations for how the Ontario government should reduce tobacco retail outlets.  We will also design a system that can measure and locate the number of tobacco retailers, allowing for the evaluation of future interventions to reduce the number of these retailers.  

The need for this research is most immediate in Ontario, but it will also be highly relevant to jurisdictions across the country, which also recognize the importance of reducing the physical availability of tobacco products."

Tracking the food you eat (diet self-monitoring) can help to make and maintain dietary changes. Current diet tracking tools are usually complex and time consuming and can lead to people stopping soon after starting. Typically, these tools require individuals to itemize foods, which is difficult for people of lower health literacy. They also do not reflect the new Canada's Food Guide (CFG) that differs from its predecessors by showing how food should be proportioned on a plate, rather than providing a list of serving measures per food group. A self-monitoring tool that will facilitate adherence to the new CFG and its new visual approach is urgently needed. Our goal is to translate the CFG from an educational tool to a diet self-monitoring application called iCANPlate for all Canadians to facilitate dietary behaviour change. 

We will:
(1)Explore how people of different health literacy levels use iCANPlate.  
(2)Determine whether iCANPlate is a usable and acceptable app.
(3)Test the effects of iCANPlate for making dietary changes and adhering to diet tracking. 

Interviews will be conducted with people of different health literacy levels to explore how they use iCANPlate. Data from this study will be used to refine iCANPlate and to create inclusive educational resources on how to use the app and the CFG. A trial will be launched to explore the usability and acceptability of the app. Then, a pilot study will be conducted to compare changes in diet quality and adherence to self-monitoring when using iCANPlate compared to receiving nutrition education only."

For example, pressure on girls to be thin in sports has resulted in unnecessary food restriction whereas pressure on boys to gain muscle has resulted in excessive consumption of protein rich foods. These trends exist across gender groups regardless of sport or level of performance (e.g., for high school all the way to collegiate sports) and may be rooted in youths desire to fit in with peers. Right now, there are no resources in place for schools to support student athletes in developing healthy food habits. 

To understand the needs of young athletes (13-18 years) and other key individuals like coaches and athletic program personnel who are involved in high school sport settings, two separate advisory panels will be created and meet 6 times over the course of one year (October 2023 to September 2024). Panel discussions will focus on identifying the type of resources that adolescent athletes and coaches could use to empower athletes to make informed, and healthy dietary choices (i.e., delivery route); and identify behavioural targets (e.g., changes in dietary habits and awareness of gender pressures in food choices) that are meaningful to address. This study will also strengthen collaboration between health researchers affiliated with the University of British Columbia (UBC, Canada), University of Newcastle (Australia), University of Galway (Ireland) to develop an outreach plan to inform knowledge mobilization activities that are most important to youth."

Lyme disease offers a cautionary tale for the next vector-borne disease in Canada: early cases went untreated by physicians unaware of its presence or unfamiliar with symptoms. Even today, uncertainty about test accuracy and availability, diagnostic symptoms, and sequelae lead to highly variable health outcomes. Learning from this history, we have developed a convergence research programme on tick-borne diseases (myLyme.ca). As part of this initiative, we here propose to develop and apply modern genomic tools for unbiased detection and surveillance of endemic and emerging tick-borne pathogens in ticks collected from across Canada. This includes development of laboratory protocols, bioinformatic standards, and data visualisations to improve surveillance and diagnosis. In contrast to current 'targeted' methods, the untargeted methods we propose can identify novel pathogens and variants of concern. Bioinformatics pipelines linked to a visualization tool for health care workers will map known variants and help identify emerging pathogens, while a new partnership south of the border will help to identify future ticks and pathogens likely to invade Canada over the next decade."

Although there is some research evidence for a link between youth vaping and cigarette smoking, less is known about the characteristics of youth that start using, keep using, and stop using vapes. Additionally, we know that the school environment can impact many youth health behaviours.

Because of the novelty of vapes, there are few school-based programs targeting vaping. This study will investigate whether a vaping prevention curriculum called 'CATCH My Breath' (CMB) prevents high school students from starting to vape. We will recruit 28 schools in Ontario into the intervention group, and students at these schools will be presented with the CMB curriculum by Public Health Unit staff. CMB is an evidence-based program that includes two 70-minute lessons that provide students with information about social norms related to vaping, health risks of vaping, media literacy, and in-class activities to practice refusal skills. Students will complete an online survey before being exposed to the curriculum, 3-months later, and 12-months later. The vaping behaviours of these students will be compared to students in the COMPASS study who are not given the curriculum. The COMPASS study is an ongoing cohort study of youth health behaviours, including vaping. Evidence from this project will identify whether students exposed to CMB are less likely to start and continue vaping. If effective, CMB can be easily delivered in high schools across Canada in order to reduce the number of students who vape."

This study will (1) identify the association between vape retailer proximity/density and youth lifetime vaping, current (past month) vaping, and purchasing vapes from a retail store, and (2) evaluate the impact of changes in vape retailer proximity/density on youth lifetime vaping, current vaping, and purchasing vapes from a retail store. We will also examine how associations differ by gender, race, and area-level socioeconomic status. Data for this research come from two existing datasets: the COMPASS Study, a 15-year study (2012-2027) that tracks the health behaviours of over 80,000 students from more than 180 schools in five Canadian provinces over time, and vape retailer data from 2019, 2021, and 2023 available through the Ontario Ministry of Health. We will link the datasets together to identify changes in vape retailer proximity/density between 2019 and 2023 and cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between vape retailer proximity/density and youth vaping. This research will provide the first evidence of the impact of changes in vape retailer proximity/density around schools on youth vaping, which will inform the development of policies that restrict vape retailers around schools."
Health Research Capacity Development Evaluation: A Realist Review,"['Cole, Donald C', 'Aslanyan, Garry', 'Bates, Imelda', 'Kakuma, Ritsuko']",['N/A'],"['Capacity Development', 'Evaluation', 'Health Research', 'Realist Review']",90127.0,215753,"Investments in Health Research Capacity Development (HRCD) continue to be an important component of both health research funding and capacity development funding globally. Yet evidence on HRCD impacts and the differential effectiveness of approaches to HRCD and its evaluation is limited, partly because evaluations have not been explicitly incorporated as an output of HRCD program implementation and monitoring. 

We recently completed a scoping review of peer-reviewed publications which examine the longer term (years) impact of HRCD initiatives and found only ten studies: seven from high income countries and four from low income countries. Many funding agencies mandate evaluations of HRCD, either by their own program officers or external evaluators in conjunction with HRCD program implementers, but these don't become public. Members of Enhancing Support for Strengthening the Effectiveness of National Capacity Efforts (ESSENCE) for Health Research want to harmonize their monitoring and evaluation practices so they have drafted a framework to assist ESSENCE members develop their own guidelines for monitoring and evaluation. 

Given the minimal empirical evidence, the complexity of HRCD and its evaluation, and the keen interest of policy makers, we propose a realist review to answer the broad research question: ""What HRCD evaluation works for whom, in what contexts, and in what ways?"".  In dialogue between the review team and ESSENCE members, we will follow these steps:  1) clarify the scope; 2) search for evidence primarily in the grey literature held by funders over the last ten years; 3) appraise reports and extract data in relation to both the ESSENCE M&E framework and other relevant indicators; and 4) synthesize our findings. We will discuss our findings iteratively with ESSENCE members, set out the existing knowledge and resource gaps for appropriate HRCD evaluation, and mutually generate a set of recommendations to guide evaluation of future HRCD initiatives."

Unfortunately, following a heart diagnosis women are less likely to be referred to participate and complete a cardiac rehabilitation program.

This project will ask people with lived experience (i.e., women with lived experience of heart disease; family, friends, and caregivers of women who have experienced heart disease) and health professionals to develop research questions for women's heart health and cardiac rehabilitation using a technique called priority setting partnership founded by the James Lind Alliance. A steering committee (people with lived experience and health professionals managing the project) will bring Canadians with the lived experience of heart disease and health professionals involved in their care together to participate in three phases of the project. First, a survey will collect their questions about women's heart health and cardiac rehabilitation; these responses will be reviewed by the steering committee and checked against existing evidence. Second, a survey will ask the group to rank the questions for discussion at an in-person workshop event. Third, the team will further discuss at the in-person meeting to identify the 10 most important questions for women's heart health and cardiac rehabilitation.

The Women's Heart Health and Cardiac Rehabilitation Priority Setting Partnership will identify 10 research questions from individuals with different viewpoints. The study will help focus future research and potential funding opportunities for women's heart health and cardiac rehabilitation."

An increasing number of healthcare facilities are requiring employees to either be vaccinated or wear a medical mask when providing care to patients during the influenza season. Studies of split virus vaccines in healthy adults (the most common vaccine used in Canadian adults) have detected an increase in systemic (whole body) adverse events compared to placebo in one-time studies. Whether these reactions recur with subsequent vaccinations is unknown. However, there is a small population of healthcare workers who report repeated systemic symptoms after vaccination. These reactions may be a result of a psychological reaction; however, they may also occur because they have true physical reactions to components of the vaccines. If the latter is true, then alternatives such as the use of other types of vaccines might be better tolerated by these people. A survey of healthcare workers will find out how many have systemic reactions and whether these reactions caused them to refuse subsequent vaccines. The findings of this research will inform policy-makers of the need to accommodate people with reactions to split virus vaccine."

Adults who meet this level are considered seroprotected and the percentage of vaccinated people who achieve this level of seroprotection is one of the standards that need to be met for annual licensure of inactivated influenza vaccines. However, how well these measures of seroprotection are linked with actual protection against influenza has limited scientific support. Further to this, most of the available research lacks information about exposure to people who are ill, which is critical to the interpretation of the results; influenza is spread from person-to-person and people who are not exposed to others with influenza are not at risk of contracting it.
 
We have blood samples from a large 4-year cohort study recently completed in Canada that collected pre- and post-season blood samples from 1740 adults, of whom 107 had nasal swabs that tested positive for influenza, along with demographic and exposure information for all participants. Once the final season's blood samples are tested, the information can be used to estimate the level of antibodies that were protective against influenza in this population. We will also be able to assess whether adjusting for the level of exposure to influenza, both at the community and individual levels, affects the level of antibody required to protect them. This information will be useful in determining whether changes are required for annual licensure of influenza vaccines and whether there are groups of people who need vaccines that induce higher levels of antibodies to confer protection."

HIV prevention strategies, including testing and medical treatments, have changed enormously in the past decade. These changes include the greater availability of point-of-care testing, and recent increases in the GBTMSM using Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP). Further, information that is relevant to GBTMSM living outside of larger metropolitan cities is often not available, creating problems when designing health prevention and promotion campaigns that are not based on lived experiences of those being targeted. This represents one of the few research projects to obtain large amounts of information from GBTMSM that reflects life outside of a large metropolitan area and that will have direct impact on local programs and services, and potentially beyond.
The OutLook Study is a community-based research (CBR) project started by local communities and allies that gathered survey information from local lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) people in the Region of Waterloo, Ontario. The survey asked questions about social support, and community connections, and asked more detailed questions to GBTMSM about sexual behaviours, access to sexual health services, and opinions and knowledge about issues that are important and relevant to GBTMSM (HIV disclosure, for example). OutLook collected surveys from 269 GBTMSM who live, work, or go to school in the Region. Analyses explored HIV & STI testing practices; sexual behaviour; access to community sexual health and HIV services; HIV criminalization and disclosure knowledge; and use of and access to PrEP in local GBTMSM.

Over the past 60 years, Canada has made progress recognizing rights of SDCs, such as legalizing same-sex marriage and introducing specific protections. However, discrimination and hate crimes, especially against transgender people, are increasing. For example, regionally, in Oxford and Elgin Counties, Norwich Township Council recently passed a motion against flying Pride flags, and the Counties and other regions reporting cases of stealing flags and damaging rainbow crosswalks.

Studies show SDCs often face more health issues, like mood disorders, anxiety, suicide, and higher risk of sexually transmitted infections. Adding to this, these problems can be worsened because of avoiding healthcare due to feeling uncomfortable with providers or facing discrimination. SDCs also face challenges at different stages of their lives, such as figuring out their identities, dealing with relationships, facing ongoing discrimination, and aging.

Our research project, involving partnerships across Oxford and Elgin Counties, Ontario, aims to better understand and improve health and healthcare for SDCs in these areas. We plan to:
1) Compare health and healthcare in Oxford and Elgin Counties, using data to see differences for SDCs. We will consider various factors like race, sexual orientation, gender identity, and different abilities;
2) Look closely at how life experiences affect SDCs' health and access to healthcare. We will speak with people and hold group discussions to hear their stories and see how age, income, and cultural background play a role;
3) Share findings with local communities, healthcare workers, and policymakers to help everyone understand these issues, working together to come up with strategies and plans based on the community's needs."
Children's Perceptions of the Ontario Student Nutrition Program's Farm-to-School Initiative in Southwestern Ontario,"['Colley, Paige']",['N/A'],"['Child Health', 'Ics Travel Awards', 'Qualitative Research', 'School Nutrition']",1500.0,400570,"Poor nutrition is a principle contributor to the rising rates of obesity, type-2 diabetes, and other diet-related diseases among Canadian children. Identifying effective strategies for promoting healthy eating can aid in reversing declining nutrition levels and ultimately improve the overall health of children. 

The Ontario Student Nutrition Program's (OSNP) Farm-to-School initiative delivers locally-sourced fruit, vegetable, and supplementary food group snacks to elementary schools. This approach offers consistent, high-nutrient-quality snacks that follow Ministry nutrition guidelines, a change from traditional school food models, where nutritional quality and sources of food vary greatly by school. With increased access to healthy food, the program aims to support children's nutrition and prevent diet-related diseases.    

The purpose of my research is to assess children's perceptions of OSNP's Farm-to-School program through focus groups. Group discussions with child participants will assess influences of the program on their dietary behaviours, preferences, intake, willingness to try, and nutritional knowledge. A total of 37 child focus groups were conducted at 21 elementary schools in Southwestern Ontario. 

Preliminary results suggest that the program was positively received by the students. Some students indicated that the snacks helped them to feel full. Most of the children liked the foods offered, with few items that were disliked. The program also influenced many of the children to eat healthier at school and home. It was recommended by some of the students that they receive more and a greater variety of foods.   

The farm-to-school program had a positive impact on children's diets. Using the findings from this study, the program can be further improved and streamlined across all 480+ schools involved with OSNP. It is anticipated that this initiative will have a considerable influence on children's nutrition in Southwestern Ontario."

However, due to a lack of affordable housing in cities, single room accommodation (SRAs) housing has long been 'housing of the last resort' for people who use drugs. Previous research has highlighted the negative impacts of SRA housing on health outcomes, with women facing additional harms (e.g. increased violence, adverse mental health outcomes). In Vancouver, British Columbia (BC) SRA units are among the only housing options available to people who use drugs amid a housing crisis, despite these known health-related risks, and the majority of SRAs are concentrated in the Downtown Eastside neighbourhood - the site of Canada's largest drug scene. Currently, Vancouver's housing crisis overlaps with a province-wide opioid overdose crisis, the centre of which is also the Downtown Eastside. Approximately 30% of fatal overdoses in 2017 took place in SRA housing or shelters. Indigenous women have been unduly impacted by these overlapping crises compared to non-Indigenous women. This highlights the need to understand the specific ways in which women, especially Indigenous women, are at risk of overdose. While previous research has highlighted how social, physical, political, and economic factors influence drug-related risks (e.g. syringe sharing, drug use environments), no research has examined how SRA housing creates overdose risks for women who use drugs. This project addresses this research gap by examining the unique ways in which women who use drugs experience and manage overdose risk within SRA housing."
The structural and everyday violence of evictions among women who use drugs in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside,"['Collins, Alexandra B']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1125.0,364252,"Single room occupancy hotels (SROs) exist as a last resort housing option for vulnerable urban populations, including women who use drugs. Largely unregulated, SROs are impacted by gendered power relations and have the potential to increase violence towards women and exacerbate housing vulnerability and likelihood of evictions. While poor health and drug-related harms are associated with living in SROs, including HIV risks, there is a need to understand how dwelling in an SRO may increase vulnerability for women who use drugs. As part of a community-based research project, we examined risk of, and harms stemming from, evictions from SROs in Vancouver, Canada. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 19 women who use drugs (trans-inclusive) who had been recently evicted in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside neighbourhood. Participants were interviewed at baseline and again three to six months later. 

Our findings suggest that many women in our study repeatedly cycle through evictions due to policies, practices (e.g. building policy infractions), and social factors (e.g. no control over physical space) in SROs. Various forms of violence (e.g. lack of tenancy rights, intimidation) were enacted within SROs to restrict women's abilities to contest evictions. Post-eviction, women faced additional vulnerabilities within a drug scene setting (e.g. increased drug use, sexual assault, risk of HIV), and often had to rely on others for support, highlighting complex survival strategies (e.g. short-term partnering with violent partners) participants undertake due to their vulnerability. 

Experiences of evictions amongst women who use drugs were linked with increased vulnerabilities to physical and sexual harm, drug-related risks, and cycles of eviction. The guaranteeing of adequate housing and consideration of gendered experiences of housing by national and provincial governments has potential to minimize health and social inequalities, including HIV risk, for this population."

Because prior studies on depression and mortality were based on fairly short follow-up times, the existing evidence derives from depression's short-term effects. The current application proposes to investigate the association between depression and death with a long focus: six decades. We will do so in one of the longest running studies of psychiatric disorders - the Stirling County Study - that dates back to the early 1950s and consists of three successive samples (1952, 1970, and 1992) involving 4,140 subjects. We propose to link these survey responses to Statistics Canada data up to 2011, thereby providing 59 years of follow-up data on mortality for the 1952 sample, 41 years of follow-up data on the 1970 sample, and 19 years of follow-up data on the 1992 sample. The proposed research has three specific aims. The first aim is to investigate premature death associated with depression in the three Stirling County Study Samples, and to determine whether mortality rates differ by gender and socioeconomic status. The second aim is to determine which types of depression are most strongly associated with mortality, by investigating clinically identified sub-types of depression thought to be most severe, and scientifically identified sub-types based on results of statistical analyses of depressive symptoms recorded among participants in 1992. The third aim is to investigate the role of other risk factors for disease in the association between depression and mortality, focusing on alcoholism, obesity, cigarette smoking, and heart problems. The successful completion of these aims will yield new insights into the consequences of depressive illness and will contribute to reducing the public health burden of depression."
The effect of parenting practices during childhood on adolescent mental health and behaviour,"['Colman, Ian R']","['Gilman, Stephen E', 'Kingsbury, Mila', 'Manion, Ian G', 'Swanson, Sonja A']","['Depression', 'Epidemiology', 'Parenting', 'Suicidality']",74943.0,363376,"Depression and suicidal thought are common among youth. Many potentially modifiable factors have been proposed as risk factors for adolescent depression and suicidal thought, including poor parenting practices in childhood. However, parenting practices are linked to numerous other factors that predict poor adolescent mental health, such as poverty, stressful life events, and family breakdown. Advanced statistical methods can allow epidemiologists to account for complex relationships between factors and identify which relationships are causal in nature. The proposed research will use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY) to 1) identify whether parenting practices in childhood can cause adolescent depression and suicidal thought; 2) identify whether increasing positive parenting or decreasing negative parenting would have a bigger effect on adolescent depression and suicidal thought; and, 3) identify whether there are specific times during childhood when intervention is most effective.

The NLSCY followed a group of Canadian children from 1994/95 to 2008/09, including more than 5,000 children who entered the study before the age of 5. Measures of positive and negative parenting practices were collected every two years until the child was 11. Beginning at age 12, children answered questions about symptoms of depression and suicidal thoughts. Additionally, the NLSCY collected data throughout childhood and adolescence on many other factors relevant to parenting and adolescent mental health. The use of previously collected longitudinal data makes this project highly resource and time efficient.

Overall impact of this project: This project will provide evidence that will help public health policy makers and planners to prioritize intervention targets to reduce adolescent depression and suicidality."

The primary goal of the proposed project is to use Canadian data to investigate childhood and adolescent predictors of NEET status in early adulthood, and to identify potentially protective factors that might help reduce the likelihood of becoming NEET. This study will use data from more than 6,000 participants in the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY), a longitudinal study of Canadian children followed every two years from 1994/95 to 2008/09, and collected data on numerous aspects of their lives, including information about their families, their mental health, and major stressors. The NLSCY has recently been linked by Statistics Canada to income tax data, which allows us to identify NEET status at age 24. Results of this investigation will identify potentially modifiable factors on the pathway towards marginalization in young adulthood."

Research shows that the prevalence of mental disorders is higher in TGD individuals compared others, and this may be explained by negative social experiences, such as discrimination and harassment. Furthermore, TGD individuals may be more likely to experience discrimination from health professionals and face other barriers to mental health care. On the other hand, positive social experiences, including support from family and friends, have been shown to be associated with better mental health among TGD populations. Despite increased attention on mental health among transgender adolescents, there are few studies that investigate aspects of positive mental health and these studies are rarely drawn from large-sample population surveys.

The proposed research aims to answer the following questions:

1) How does the mental health of TGD youth differ in comparison to their cisgender peers?
2) Are positive social experiences (from peers, family, the school environment, the neighbourhood) associated with fewer negative mental health outcomes in TGD youth?
3) Do negative social experiences explain the mental health disparities between TGD and cisgender youth, and can positive social experiences buffer TGD youth from the deleterious effects of negative social experiences?
4) Does optimism for the future differ between TGD youth compared to cisgender peers?
5) Does mental-health-related help seeking differ between TGD youth compared to cisgender peers?
6) Do the above associations differ across other lines of intersectionality, including race/ethnicity?

These questions will first be answered using large survey data from thousands of high school students across Canada, and then later explored with one-on-one interviews with TGD youth."
COVID-19 Vaccine Confidence Among At-Risk and Under-Vaccinated Groups Within HIV and Rheumatic diseases (CONFIDENCE),"['Colmegna, Ines', 'Costiniuk, Cecilia T', 'Pelaez, Sandra']","['Legare, Jean', 'Merry, Lisa A', 'Ruppenthal, Luciana']","['Covid Vaccines', 'Hiv', 'Language Barriers', 'Migrants', 'Systemic Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases', 'Transnationalism', 'Vaccine Acceptance', 'Vaccine Hesitancy', 'Women']",199000.0,451256,"People living with human immunodeficiency virus (PL-HIV) as well as people living with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (PL-SARDs) are more likely to have severe COVID-19 and to die of it compared to individuals in the general population. Vaccination against COVID-19 is key to reducing these risks. However, ~20% of the eligible Canadian population is not yet vaccinated. Moreover, recent data suggest that vaccine rates and acceptance are lower in migrants, women, and people with physical disabilities. These 'especially vulnerable subgroups' are frequent among PL-HIV and PL-SARDs. Previous literature reported that vulnerable subgroups of PL-HIV and PL-SARDs share common reasons that lead to reduced COVID-19 vaccine uptake. We propose to work along with members of these subgroups to uncover those reasons and to empower trusted members of these communities so they can communicate with their peers in ways that motivate behavior change (i.e., vaccine acceptance). In order to understand the reasons that could enhance COVID-19 vaccine confidence in the aforementioned vulnerable groups, we will conduct virtual group meetings (i.e., focus groups) and individual phone interviews with those not willing to join the group discussions. The information gathered from these activities will then be used to design a training program for community members to promote vaccine confidence through motivational interviewing and storytelling techniques. The feasibility of training community members in motivational interviewing and an initial feedback on the impact of the intervention promoting behavioral change in their communities will be evaluated. Our team, composed of community members, health care providers and researchers, has the required expertise to accomplish the work proposed in a timely fashion, to disseminate the study results and to advocate for implementation measures to address other aspects to promote vaccine acceptance identified during the course of the study."

While the transmission of H. pylori has decreased in developed countries, evidence suggests that northern Aboriginal populations have a disproportionately high prevalence of H. pylori infection, and relatively low success from treatment aimed at eliminating the bacteria. Although identified by northern public health providers and communities as a health care concern, limited data are available about H. pylori occurrence in northern Canada. A collaborative initiative is in progress that aims to describe the burden of disease and risk factors associated with H. pylori infection, and seeks to identify effective public health strategies for control of this infection; this research links community representatives, faculty from various disciplines at the University of Alberta, as well as Northwest Territories and Yukon health care practitioners and health authorities. An important component of this research is the movement of knowledge created through research into implementation by users such as community members and healthcare providers, a process known as knowledge translation. Because of differences in knowledge structures and world views between Aboriginal communities, researchers and health officials, the development of tools to strengthen this process is essential. The current research seeks to identify appropriate knowledge translation strategies and to evaluate their effectiveness; this work will aid the research program currently underway and will also broaden our understanding of best practices in knowledge translation within participatory research in northern Aboriginal communities and across Canada."
"Dispensation of drug regimens to treat Helicobacter pylori infection in First Nations and Inuit peoples in Alberta, Canada","['Colquhoun, Amy']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal Peoples', 'Epidemiology', 'Helicobacter Pylori', 'Ics Travel Awards', 'Stomach Cancer']",2637.0,347136,"Introduction
Helicobacter pylori is a type of bacteria that is a known risk factor for peptic ulcer disease and stomach cancer. Because little data are available on H. pylori infection and treatment in Aboriginal peoples in Canada, we aimed to describe the patterns of drugs given out to treat the infection in First Nations (FN) and Inuit peoples living in Alberta, Canada.

Methods
Using pharmacy data, we identified individuals dispensed drugs used to treat H. pylori infection during 2009 through 2014. We estimated average annual rates of H. pylori treatment by FN/Inuit status, sex, year, and geographic health zone. We also compared rates across FN/Inuit and non-FN/Inuit populations.

Results
Less than 1% of the FN/Inuit population was given at least one set of drugs for the treatment of H. pylori infection: the majority of drugs were given to females (64%) and to those 35-59 years of age (58%). Among females, the rate of a first drug treatment in FN/Inuit was about double the rate in non-FN/Inuit. For a second treatment in females, the rate in FN/Inuit was almost three times the rate in non-FN/Inuit. FN/Inuit rates were highest in the northern healthcare zone, with the number of drugs given out to treat the infection in this area accounting for almost half of those dispensed to FN/Inuit across Alberta (46%).

Conclusions
These results suggest a higher burden of H. pylori infection in the FN/Inuit population compared to non-FN/Inuit living in Alberta, Canada, particularly among females and those living in northern areas of the province."

Understanding social equity for health: international comparisons of social conditions and their impact on individual health and wellbeing,"['Conklin, Annalijn']",['N/A'],"['Gender', 'Global Health', 'International Comparisons', 'Multilevel Modelling', 'Social Determinants', 'Wellbeing']",150000.0,300873,"Good health is critical for nations to flourish and develop. Yet, large systematic disparities in health exist between, and within, countries, and these differences are strongly linked to degrees of social disadvantage. Thus, tackling social disparities is a key policy objective, and development interest, of governments worldwide. Inequalities in health are known to be driven by multiple political, social and economic forces at social and individual levels.  Understanding the role of these factors at a policy level in determining living conditions needed for equitable health and wellbeing is an important step in designing appropriate public health strategies and supporting government actions to reduce health inequities.

To date, most research has examined intermediary social determinants of health, particularly behaviours. But, there are many fundamental causes of health inequities that are not yet fully understood and thus have been identified as a priority for research. These include policies on education, economic resources and discrimination, especially gender-based. The real research question therefore is what role do social policies play in determining health, and how might they interact with one another and with intermediary determinants. The project will use advanced methods to examine three identified policy areas in relation to key health outcomes recommended by WHO for monitoring health equity. It will compare different countries since rich and poor countries need to solve the same health issues and health inequities are not necessarily smaller in countries with generous policies. It draws on a unique and rich source of globally-comparative data on diverse policies/legislations linked to household health surveys in nearly 100 countries; 14 countries with biomarker data will be prioritised. Ultimately, the project aims to inform evidence-based strategies for Canada and other states to promote equitable health for all citizens in each nation."
Exploring the link and inter-relations between social relationships and objectively measured cardiometabolic risk factors in older adult women and men in Canada   Committee,"['Conklin, Annalijn']","['Khan, Nadia A', 'Veenstra, Gerry D']","['Body Weight', 'Gender', 'Hypertension', 'Obesity', 'Social Ties', 'Socioeconomic Position']",69972.0,389875,"Social relationships can protect against a wide range of chronic conditions and facilitate recovery from disease. The quantity and quality of a person's social ties matter for their overall physical and mental health. Women and men differ in the number and size of different types of social relationships and in their health impacts. How social ties influence health and longevity is not fully understood. In addition, although Canada's vision for healthy aging includes a focus on social connections among seniors, Canadian research on social ties in relation to obesity or hypertension is limited and nearly two decades old. The general literature also has many unanswered questions, such as which aspects of different social ties show the strongest variation in biological markers for longevity in older adult women and men. And since lack of social ties of one type might be mitigated by having another type of social tie, more work is needed to understand how different social ties interact to produce combined effects on the health of older adult women and men. The current study aims to fill this knowledge gap by examining multiple aspects of quantity and quality of social ties in relation to waist circumference, body mass index and blood pressure. The project brings together an interdisciplinary and complementary team of clinical, sociological and epidemiological scholars with extensive experience researching the broader social determinants of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. The results will have public health implications for supporting healthy ageing since over-50s are more likely to experience transitions in the structure and function of their social relationships, moving from multiple to more limited or no ties."

We know that the numbers of Indigenous women dying from heart diseases are 76% higher than non-Indigenous women in Canada, and the numbers are going up. But, two thirds of what we know about heart health is based on studies of men only and we know even less about the specific needs of Indigenous women. This project aims to fill this large gap by taking the next steps for preventive action that were suggested during out pre-research community consultations. 

This grant proposal is a collaboration with Coast Salish Peoples, specifically Squamish Nation, to co-develop a program of 'foraging walks' as a new way to promote heart health among Indigenous women. It will first seek permission for land use from Squamish Tribal Council and then build relations with the recommended community groups to co-develop a foraging walks program. This development stage will lay the foundation for a future feasibility study to test the acceptability, practicality and potential health value for Indigenous women from the local urban area of Vancouver.

We will use talking/drumming circles as the main tool for engaging communities and building new relationships. Our team is strongly inter-disciplinary as it comprises experts in Indigenous wisdom and traditional knowledges, women's heart patient experiences, health promotion and public health, evaluation, and implementation science.

In particular, measures of social connectedness such as marital status are linked to greater survival and less chronic disease. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has really highlighted the importance of social ties, older people are especially at high risk of transitioning from multiple to few or no social ties, and this can threaten health differently in women versus men. However, there is very little research examining whether and how changes in different social ties influence the biological indicators of aging, or how their effects vary for women and men. Our preliminary work suggests that marital status, social participation, social networks and living arrangement are more strongly linked to linked to obesity and hypertension in women than men in Canada. Far less is known about whether economic circumstances alter the importance of social connectedness for cardiovascular risk. To fill these critical knowledge gaps, the current project will build on our initial work to (1) assess changes in obesity and hypertension over time in women and men by types of social tie transitions; (2) quantify how changes in different social ties impact these healthy aging indicators; and (3) explore the role of financial autonomy in social connectedness and cardiovascular risk. Using established techniques, we take a unique approach of looking at sex/gender, which is typically given less attention in cardiovascular research. The results will have implications for decision-makers who shape tailored, evidence-driven policies, services and programs that promote social connections and engagement among Canadians in order to advance our national healthy aging strategy."

The applicants previously demonstrated that cognitive behavioural interventions targeting common neurocognitive risk factors for psychiatric and substance use disorders were highly effective in reducing concurrent substance use/misuse and internalising and externalising problems in high risk youth.  Using this same strategy, the current project aims to apply our recent findings from neurocognitive and qualitative research on children with PPLEs to the development of a new, targeted cannabis and psychosis prevention strategy. Using a multi-method research approach, this one year project has three aims. First, we aim to collect qualitative information from high-risk youth on the internal and external triggers for cannabis use.  The new, targeted intervention will incorporate findings from our neurocognitive studies on PPLEs and our these qualitative findings.  Second, in a proof-of-concept study with 30 youth reporting PPLEs and regular cannabis use, we will examine whether the new intervention is associated with a reduction in cannabis use and other mediators of use.  Finally, we aim to explore how this brief manual-based intervention can be delivered by clinicians within the school or pediatric setting by conducting focus groups with key stakeholders in order to develop a feasible and sustainable implementation strategy."

Psychosocial Wellness and Obesity: An Evaluation of an Immersion-Based Youth Weight Loss Program,"['Conron, Chelsea L']",['N/A'],"['Body Mass Index (Bmi)', 'Body-Esteem', 'Depression', 'Immersion-Based Weight Loss Program', 'Obesity', 'Psychosocial Wellbeing', 'Self-Esteem', 'Social And Academic Perceptions Of The Self']",17500.0,201602,"The proposed research seeks to understand the effects of an immersion-based weight loss program on the psychological and social health of obese adolescents. It is estimated that 15% of Canadian children meet the criteria for being overweight, and 30-40% may be at risk for obesity in their adult years. This rapidly increasing statistic is of grave concern to parents and children, public health and to all levels of our economy. Not only is obesity a physical health risk, it is a threat to psychological wellness. The link between physical and mental health is compelling, complex, and crucial to understand in order to fight pediatric obesity. The proposed research intends to assess an ethnically diverse sample of youth for depression, self and body esteem, and body mass index at several time points over the course of a holistic, immersion treatment program, in order to understand the effects of weight loss on youth's views of themselves and their mental health. This will be compared to an outpatient community weight loss program to further determine the effective elements of treatment. It is expected that as an individual experiences weight loss, their self and body esteem and their perceived social acceptance will improve, and levels of depression will diminish due to increased belief in themselves and the positive social connections within the immersion environment. It is expected that a full immersion approach will be more effective than a community support group. Understanding the complex relationship between mental and physical health, and comparing available treatment options is vital to the further development of effective treatment programs and to spreading public awareness about the effects of obesity on mental health. This research is a key step in getting to the bottom of pediatric obesity before it takes a greater toll on the next generation, the individual, public health and wellness."
Physical Activity and Breast Cancer Etiology: the Underlying Biological Mechanisms,"['Conroy, Shannon']",['N/A'],"['Biological Mechanisms', 'Body Weight', 'Breast Cancer', 'Exercise', 'Immunity', 'Inflammation', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Structural Equation Modeling']",90000.0,252365,"Physical activity reduces breast cancer risk and, thereby, is an excellent means for primary prevention. An improved understanding of how physical activity reduces breast cancer development is needed in designing optimal lifestyle interventions. To date, research has focused on individual biologic pathways, such as changes in body fat, hormone levels, insulin resistance or inflammation. The aim of this project is to evaluate a biologic model relating multiple inter-related pathways for breast cancer using data from the Alberta Physical Activity and Breast Cancer Prevention (ALPHA) Trial. The ALPHA Trial was a randomized controlled trial of 320 inactive postmenopausal women that examined the effects of a year-long moderate-to-vigorous aerobic exercise intervention on biomarkers for breast cancer. As part of the present project, a supplementary study will collect data on biologic endpoints not previously examined in the ALPHA Trial. The project will simultaneously estimate the exercise-induced change on sex hormones, body fat, insulin resistance, inflammation, immunity and oxidative stress. Analyses will be performed using advanced statistical modeling methods to quantify the direct and indirect effects of the exercise intervention on different pathways and, therefore, identify the predominant pathways affected by the exercise intervention. This project is one of the first to examine the simultaneous effects of an exercise intervention on multiple inter-related endpoints within a randomized controlled design. The findings from this project will contribute to an understanding of the beneficial biological effects for a given dose of exercise and help guide future healthy lifestyle recommendations to obtain the desired preventive effects for reducing breast cancer risk."
"Reproductive health, metabolic-related disease, and aging: exploring reproductive health and chronic disease across the lifecourse among postmenopausal females","['Cook, Claire E']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Chronic Disease Prevention', 'Diabetes', 'Menarche/Menopause', 'Metabolic-Related Disease', 'Obesity', 'Population Health', 'Public Health', 'Reproductive Health', ""Women'S Health""]",150000.0,495726,"Women experience many reproductive health events throughout their lives, such as menstruation, pregnancy, and menopause. However, we do not yet know how these reproductive health experiences might impact a woman's overall health over time. Reproductive health also changes significantly as women age. These reproductive changes throughout life may influence whether or not a woman develops a chronic disease as they get older. The goal of the proposed research project is to learn more about how reproductive health and chronic disease are related throughout a woman's lifetime. To achieve this goal, I will describe how reproductive health events are related to each other over a woman's life and will examine how different reproductive health events (such as age at first period) will impact the possibility of being diagnosed with a chronic disease (such as obesity and Type II diabetes) as women age. Understanding how reproductive health may impact women's health over time is incredibly important as Canada's population ages and the number of people with chronic diseases increases. Improving our understanding of women's health will help us learn how to better screen for and prevent chronic diseases. Recognizing the importance of women's health over the life course is critical to improve reproductive health care among women of all ages and to prevent chronic disease and promote healthy aging among older women."

An important concern is protecting young people from potential harms of cannabis use. Cannabis use by Canadian youth is among the highest in the world, although recent trends have been downwards. It is critical to monitor how these patterns change after legalization. These effects of legalization might also differ between provinces, which will be able to set different ages for legal purchase and different rules for retail sales and distribution. 

This project will contribute to understanding the impact of legalization on cannabis use by youth. First, we will use existing survey data to identify recent trends in cannabis use by age and sex/gender, for each province and for subgroups of youth (official language minorities, youth in low income households, rural and urban youth, recent immigrants). Although we have information about national trends, we do not know how these vary by province, or for these subgroups. This analysis will help us see how patterns of cannabis use by youth change after legalization, as new data become available. 

Second, we will create a new survey to collect information on cannabis use among youth. National and provincial surveys currently ask whether young people have used cannabis but do not capture other important aspects of use such as whether they obtained cannabis from illegal sources, forms of cannabis used, and the price paid, among others. We will identify aspects that are most important to capture and pilot test questions with focus groups of youth to produce a survey questionnaire to be used in future data collections. 

This work will be conducted by the team that collects the Canadian Student Tobacco Alcohol and Drugs Survey, a national survey of youth conducted for Health Canada, and additional experts. Health Canada and the Canadian Centre for Substance Use and Addictions are Knowledge Users for the project"
Consistent Collection and Reporting of Diagnostic Data Related to Children's NeuroDevelopmental Disorders,"['Cook, Jocelynn L']","['Green, Courtney R']","['Database', 'Dataform', 'Neurodevelopmental Disabilities']",11295.0,308178,"Children's neurodevelopmental disorders are a significant issue in Canada, affecting a large percentage of families.  The majority of neurodevelopmental disorders are defined by their common functional elements (i.e. attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder by a combination of behaviours that include hyperactivity, inattention and impulsivity, autism spectrum disorder by a combination of social communication deficits, cerebral palsy by motor abnormalities). Yet individuals with these conditions often have larger patterns of abnormality with considerable overlap in specific education and therapeutic needs. Recently, the Canada Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder Research Network developed and piloted a model for capturing this data from the FASD population, which can now be capitalized for broader use.  The ""dataform tool"" that was used is now ready to be expanded and adapted for collection of standardized data on children with other neurodevelopmental disorders.  The project will represent an important first step towards creating partnerships among child neurodevelopment clinics across Canada."

Many Aboriginal women experience poor access to high quality, culturally safe medical care in pregnancy and indicators of maternal-child health demonstrate significant inequities between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples.  Centralization of care and reduction in community level services has had a significant impact on Aboriginal women, particularly those in remote regions.  This access issue has created a de facto policy of referral for delivery (evacuation) where women must be removed from their communities for labour and birth.  This practice has had devastating effects on women, their families and the larger community.  The practice of referral for delivery also has significant psychosocial and economic effects on women and families.  There is growing evidence that community level care represents best practice for Aboriginal women.  

Through this project, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) will work with community partners in the Sioux Lookout First Nations Health Authority (SLFNHA) to develop and implement a multi-level program for supporting pregnant women both in, and outside of, their communities.  The specific objectives of the initiative are to create an understanding of the experiences of pregnant women; to develop priorities for maternity care and support; to design and implement a program of support that is based on community priorities, traditions, values, practices, and resources; and to create a best-practice model of community care for supporting Aboriginal women's maternity (including pre-conception and antenatal) care based on traditional teachings around birth, parenting, and families."
Methods for the analysis of complex life history data,"['Cook, Richard J']",['N/A'],"['Design Of Clinical Trials', 'Epidemiology', 'Interval Censoring', 'Life History Data', 'Oncology', 'Recurrent Events']",975511.0,189586,"New and emerging challenges in the health sciences have arisen in recent years due to greater appreciation for the complex multifactorial nature of chronic disease processes, increasing ability to capture massive amounts of data, and a growing interest in making use of existing health data bases to answer medically important questions. This research program is directed at the development of innovative, rigorous and efficient biostatistical methodology to achieve a better understanding of the underlying etiologies of disease in population studies, a clearer appreciation of biological mechanisms of activity and progression in longitudinal studies of patients with chronic disease, and powerful methods for assessing the value of experimental therapeutic interventions in clinical trials involving complex outcomes. Because statistical methods are at the foundation of any rigorous scientific inquiry, methodologic advances in biostatistics have bearing in the full spectrum of health research. 

One of the problems to be considered is how to make most efficient use of datasets from randomized and observational studies with only partial information on risk factors and outcomes due to incomplete observation. Predictive models will also be developed to guide therapeutic decision making and facilitate personalized therapy in cancer research. Models which lead to better understanding of risks for side-effects to treatments will give insight into the risks of potentially fatal adverse drug reactions and help guide use of treatments and improve patient care in orthopedic surgery. Additional topics involve the development of innovative methods for the design and analysis of clinical trials."
Biostatistical methods for outcome-dependent selection and observation schemes in the study of complex chronic diseases,"['Cook, Richard J']",['N/A'],"['Biased Sampling', 'Chronic Disease Processes', 'Dependent Assessment Times', 'Dependent Censoring', 'Life History Processes', 'Multistate Models', 'Outcome-Dependent Selection', 'Predictive Modelling', 'Survival Data', 'Validation Studies']",100000.0,387285,"Technological advances enabling the measurement, storage and processing of massive volumes of health data mean that scientists can now make use of a diverse range of data sources for studying the genetic, behavioural and environmental determinants for the onset and progression of complex chronic diseases. Efficient use of available data is critical if the goals of personalized medicine are to be met. This necessitates a paradigm shift from the focus on marginal inferences about treatment differences in randomized clinical trials, and population-level inferences common in traditional epidemiology. Databases which can be exploited to address this new focus may arise from disease registries, large cohort studies, electronic health records, large clinical trials, surveys and other sources. Advanced biostatistical methods will be developed to enable the synthesis of data across such diverse platforms ensuring that
a) the selection criteria employed in the different data sources are critically addressed,
b) biases are mitigated from complex, possibly disease-related, observation schemes, and
c) the predictive utility of models developed are suitably assessed when validation samples may employ different selection criteria and observation schemes.

Intensive high impact interdisciplinary collaborations with internationally renowned health scientists in arthritis, cancer, transfusion medicine, and public health motivate this research and provide venues for the application of the methodological advances. In summary, this research is directed at the creation and application of leading-edge biostatistical and epidemiological methods to ensure important questions in quantitative health research are rigorously and efficiently addressed using diverse sources of information."
The development and application of innovative biostatistical methodology for the study of prenatal alcohol exposure and its effect on cognitive and behavioural deficits in children,"['Cook, Richard J', 'Ryan, Louise M']","['Carter, Robert C', 'Jacobson, Joseph L', 'Jacobson, Sandra W']","['Causal Inference', 'Complex Exposures', 'Confounding', 'Generalized Estimating Equations', 'Hierarchical Models', 'Multidimensional Propensity Score', 'Multivariate Outcomes', 'Statistical Methods', 'Structural Equation Models']",661724.0,452627,"This research program will develop new biostatistical methodology for causal analysis about the effect of complex multidimensional exposures on multiple outcomes. The work is motivated by challenges arising in the synthesis of data from six studies of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD), the most common preventable cause of neuro-developmental disabilities. High levels of prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) are known to cause serious developmental problems in children, but the impact of low-levels of exposure and the impact of total volume versus the rate of consumption is unknown. Cognition is assessed using a battery of tests in the cohorts, each geared towards different processing skills, so analyses will rely on hierarchical multivariate models and growth curve analysis which incorporate innovative propensity score methodology for causal inferences.  

A recent retrospective study suggested that PAE had a larger effect on girls in terms of cognition and physical appearance. We will therefore investigate this question in our prospective studies to assess whether sex is an effect-modifier for the effect of prenatal alcohol exposure, as well as whether different domains of cognitive ability are affected for boys and girls. The effect-modifying role of maternal age, race, and SES will also be investigated.

Prenatal alcohol exposure and fetal alcohol syndrome disorders continue to be critically important public health issues affecting millions of children worldwide. This strong team of researchers with expertise in biostatistics, epidemiology, neuroscience and psychology, and child development will apply the resulting methods to these data to furnish rigorous answers to critically important questions on prenatal alcohol exposure and child health. The methodological advances made by this team will be applicable to many other public health settings involving causal assessment of complex gestational or other environmental exposures on multidimensional outcomes."

The recent outbreaks of H7N9 and H5N1 AI strains, along with the possibility for AI to change into new strains with improved human-to-human transmission, leads to concerns that AI could cause the next global pandemic. Certain AI viruses are considered to be higher risk for causing disease, particularly H5 and H7 strains. The surveillance for AI is crucial to the prevention of its devastating impacts. AI normally circulates in wild waterfowl hosts who are the targets for AI surveillance; however, these hosts typically carry the virus without showing signs of disease. Additionally, our current AI surveillance techniques in wild waterfowl is focused on testing individual birds, which is labour intensive and makes it difficult to obtain a representative sample of the whole wild host population. This is problematic as we may not be detecting many AI strains circulating in the wild hosts. A solution to this problem is to test environmental samples. As wild birds excrete the virus in their feces and many individual birds defecate in wetlands, taking samples of wetland mud allows for the detection of AI viruses deposited by many birds within the population. 

This project will be the first study to evaluate the use of wetland sediment for the ongoing surveillance of AI, and will evaluate the effectiveness the environmental method against the gold-standard. The two-year study will have monthly surveillance on 3 wetlands, where the diversity, rate of positivity, and timing of AI viruses in sediment is compared to those circulating in live waterfowl birds (the gold-standard method). Data will also be collected on related wetland ecological variables such as water temperature and waterfowl abundance. This project will provide human and animal health officials with a more efficient and accurate signal of seasonal AI risk and help to prevent future surveillance failures."

Community members note the need to build skills that will help young men make positive changes to their own health and wellbeing, as well support changes within their families and communities. 

In order to develop a clearer understanding of the health and wellbeing of Indigenous young men, it is also essential that recruitment and participation does not hinge on perceived challenges (such as drug addictions, HIV status or criminal activity). Through a series of strengths-based, capacity building workshops on themes related to health and wellness such as hunting and wilderness survival, media and technology, and positive approaches to play and parenting, we will use participatory action and Indigenous methods to develop a baseline about health issues and wellbeing as identified by young Indigenous men (ages 18-34), with recruitment preference given to those who are caregivers/mentors in their families and communities. 

Data analysis will be conducted using an Indigenous group consensus process, as well as thematic analysis. Process evaluation methods will also be used to ensure that the study remains relevant for participants. Through this work, we will identify challenges related to current health and social supports.

Stand When You Can: Feasibility of a multi-level intervention to modify sedentary behaviour among older adults in assisted living.,"['Copeland, Jennifer L', 'Wagg, Adrian S', 'Bouchard, Danielle', 'Dogra, Shilpa', 'Pope, Jacquelyn P']",['N/A'],"['Assisted Living', 'Healthy Ageing', 'Residential Care', 'Sedentary Behaviour', 'Sitting']",91262.0,418525,"Across all age groups, sedentary behaviour has been established as a risk factor for poor health. Sitting for a long time every day increases the risk of diseases such as diabetes and heart disease, as well as other issues that are common in older adults, such as problems with mobility and memory. Older adults in assisted living often have little need to engage in light intensity activities such as household chores which leads to even more sitting compared to those who live in the community. 
The goal of this study is to reduce the amount of time spent sitting to maintain and improve the health and wellness of older adults in assisted living. We have previously developed strategies to limit sitting time that target the environment, the culture, and the individual's habits to be implemented in assisted living residences. The goal of this project is to test the intervention to see if it it is acceptable and feasible in 3 different Canadian provinces:  AB, ON, and NB. The intervention consists of various strategies to encourage and support older adults to limit and break up long periods of sitting. The effectiveness of the program will be determined by measuring residents' actual sitting time before and after the program is implemented. We will also interview residents, their families, and staff to see how people feel about the strategies and how to ensure they work well for everyone. If we find that the intervention works, we will then plan to launch a larger trial across Canada. By the year 2050 there will be more than 2 billion older adults globally and the demand for residential care is expected to quadruple. To meet the needs of an aging population, research must address the unique health challenges of older adults so that they can continue to live fulfilling lives."

Supported employment (SE) programs help people with severe mental disorders obtain employment. However, job tenure for people with a severe mental disorder is often brief. One of the best predictors of job tenure is the implementation of work accommodations. However, accessing accommodations in the workplace requires disclosure of the mental disorder, and fear of stigma may lead employees to choose not to disclose. Decision-making about disclosure at work is thus a complex process, as disclosing can have both positive (e.g., work accommodation) and negative (e.g., stigma) outcomes. We will specifically be exploring disclosure to the immediate supervisor, as the supervisor plays a significant role in the implementation of work accommodations and relevant employment outcomes (job satisfaction, job tenure).

A subsample of participants (n=45) will be invited for an in-depth interview in which they will be asked about disclosure decision-making and the experience of disclosing, if applicable. Our study will provide a deeper understanding of the impact of disclosure on stigma and work outcomes (e.g., implementation of work accommodations), allowing organizations to enhance inclusivity, leading to increased job tenure, enhanced recovery and well-being for individuals, and increased productivity and reduced disability claims costs for organizations."

Cependant, plus de trente ans après le début de l'épidémie du VIH et en dépit de la disponibilité d'un grand nombre d'antirétroviraux efficaces au Canada, l'accès au traitement antirétroviral demeure inégal à l'échelle du pays. Au Canada, la majorité des personnes vivant avec le VIH (PVVIH) ont accès au traitement antirétroviral par l'entremise de programmes publics provinciaux. Or, ces programmes varient considérablement d'une province ou territoire à un autre. En Ontario, le programme ontarien de soutien aux personnes handicapées (POSPH) est un programme d'assurance sociale qui assure la couverture des médicaments sous ordonnance. Le VIH étant officiellement reconnu comme une invalidité épisodique, les PVVIH qui résident en Ontario doivent faire appel à ce programme pour assurer la couverture des coûts associés au traitement antirétroviral et autres médicament sous ordonnance. Ce projet, à notre connaissance, est le premier de son genre à s'intéresser à l'expérience des PVVIH qui font appel au POSPH. Il a pour but de décrire, d'explorer et d'expliquer le processus par lequel les PPVIH composent avec le POSPH dans un contexte d'accès au traitement antirétroviral. Les résultats de ce projet permettront d'acquérir une meilleure compréhension des différentes étapes que doivent compléter les PVVIH afin d'obtenir l'accès au traitement antirétroviral, des barrières auxquelles font face les PVVIH, et des répercussions sur la santé des PVVIH. De plus, les résultats offriront des recommandations pour l'amélioration des politiques publics en matière de santé, particulièrement au niveau de la réglementation des prestations d'assurance sociale en Ontario."
"Health Inequalities Across the Life Course: Aging, Gender and the Welfare State","['Corna, Laurie M']",['N/A'],"['Aging And The Life Course', 'Comparative Social Policy', 'Gender And Health', 'Health Inequalities', 'Latent Variable Modelling', 'Life Course Histories', 'Socioeconomic Position']",90000.0,203212,"While there is a strong relationship between measures of socioeconomic position, such as low income, and health inequalities, further research that addresses how inequalities develop over the life course is necessary. In this study, I investigate whether health inequalities differ between men and women of retirement age, and question how they are related to work and family experiences earlier in the life course. I compare these relationships across four countries: the US, Britain, Germany and Denmark. These countries vary in how social policies and provisions are organized, and have different approaches to labour market and family policy, which are important for understanding gender differences in life course experiences. I apply an analytic approach that is well suited to measuring individual change in health and socioeconomic position over time, as well as capturing the dynamics of lifetime experiences in the labour market and in the family. I hypothesize that gender differences in health inequalities will be evident in all countries, but strongest in Britain and Germany, where men are more likely to have continuous labour market participation, while women are more likely to perform care giving work in the family. A clearer understanding of how social policies and provisions are related to health inequalities in later life, including potential gender differences, is crucial for the development of health and social policy to address health inequalities among older adults. Regrettably, a comparable Canadian data source does not exist at present, but a better understanding of the relationship between gender, social policy and health inequalities will be relevant for the health of Canadians and the development of health and social policy in Canada. Moreover, the analytic method developed in this work will be applicable to future analyses of Canadian data, such as the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging as more waves of data become available."
Assessing the effectiveness of an online intervention addressing barriers to skin cancer screening behaviours among middle-aged men: A randomized controlled trial,"['Coroiu, Adina']",['N/A'],"['Intervention', 'Melanoma Prevention', 'Middle-Age Men', 'Rct', 'Skin Cancer']",150000.0,376076,"Melanoma can be a deadly disease when diagnosed at an advanced stage, but survival rates are > 98% when detected early and treated. Melanoma often develops with a visible, preclinical phase, hence there are opportunities for early detection via visually inspecting the skin. Skin self-examination (SSE) followed by physician-led clinical skin examination (CSE) are effective means to detect early signs of melanoma1. Middle-age men are often diagnosed with more advanced melanoma, have worse prognosis, and face higher mortality compared to women in the same age groups and younger men. Melanoma early detection interventions targeting men's SSE and CSE behaviours are sparse, primarily because male gender and older age are not generally regarded as risk factors for melanoma. Yet, approximately 60% of all deaths from melanoma occur in men of 50 years of age or older [SEER database; 2013]. Most available melanoma prevention interventions targeting SSE and CSE utilize an in-person educational model, which is time and resource-intensive, and potentially less amenable to men. There is an urgent need for low-cost, effective (evidence-based), and easily accessible interventions targeting middle-age men's SSE and CSE, as part of the overall effort to decrease melanoma-related mortality in this population."

Does e-cigarette use vary by province and between communities? What community risks are associated with vaping? Do rates of vaping differ across areas with higher or lower poverty, inequality, and tobacco use rates? 
Despite the availability of data to answer these questions, there remain many knowledge gaps related to vaping across Canada's diverse communities, particularly among youth and marginalized populations. 
 
Inconsistencies in Provincial and Territorial policies and regulations related to the sale and marketing of vaping products have resulted in considerable variations in the geography and patterns of vaping use across Canadian communities. The popularity and availability of e-cigarettes and other vaping products in Canada have increased steadily over the past decade. Increases have been most notable in younger populations, and this is concerning given that we now know vaping to be associated with many significant health risks.

A better understanding of regional, demographic and social patterns associated with vaping in Canada is essential to help target prevention and harm reduction efforts, and to revise policies. We will use existing data from national health surveys to examine patterns of vaping across Canada and Canadian communities, as well as the impact of policies and regulations on vaping use. From our findings, we will develop a detailed online data atlas of vaping product use across Canada that will answer the needs and questions of health care providers, policy planners, researchers, and the public."

We are proposing a Pan-Canadian network of researchers, health care providers, decision-makers and families to lead a contemporary research program that will address knowledge gaps in our understanding of the risks of cannabis exposure to babies, mothers, and their families. 

Over the next five years, we aim to determine the likelihood of developmental impairments in children due to perinatal cannabis exposure. We will build a national database using existing Canadian pregnancy cohorts, perinatal registries, and novel data collection. Our research will identify ""windows of susceptibility"" to cannabis for the developing brain by analyzing biological samples collected from mothers and infants in the perinatal period. We will also seek the experiences and perspectives of new and expectant parents, and their care providers to develop reliable, accessible and easy-to-understand public resources that support informed decision-making about cannabis use in pregnancy and while breastfeeding.

Our proposed Network will be a sustainable platform for ongoing research on cannabis use in pregnancy in Canada. Our results will improve the transmission of knowledge around cannabis in pregnancy and contribute to better care and outcomes for infants, families and Canadian society."
Informing Care by understanding the association between chronic pelvic pain and interpersonal trauma through patient and provider narratives: A mixed-methods study to improve clinical gynecologic care,"['Corsini-Munt, Serena A', 'Singh, Sukhbir S']","['Flaxman, Teresa', 'Gates-Mackinnon, Jennifer', 'Horwood, Genevieve', 'Stragapede, Elisa T']","['Chronic Pelvic Pain', 'Female Reproductive Health', 'Gynecology', 'Interpersonal Trauma', 'Patient Centred Care', 'Trauma Informed Care']",100000.0,494538,"Chronic pelvic pain, defined as pelvic pain most days for more than 6 months, is among the most common reasons for referral to gynecology and is often a component of other diseases such as endometriosis. Interpersonal trauma has been identified as a risk and maintaining factor for chronic pelvic pain. Interpersonal trauma, defined as trauma that involves interaction with another person, includes physical, sexual and emotional abuse experienced in childhood or adulthood. For example, individuals with a history of sexual abuse were more likely to be diagnosed with chronic pelvic pain compared to individuals without a history of sexual abuse. Although a risk factor for chronic pelvic pain, interpersonal trauma is rarely addressed by gynecologic practitioners.  Evidence suggests that patient engagement and response to treatment for chronic pelvic pain is diminished if past trauma is not addressed by providers. Yet gynecology health specialists receive limited formal training in this area. Trauma-informed care acknowledges possible trauma histories, fosters collaborative decision-making, and respects different experiences and responses to trauma. The aim of this study will be to provide an understanding of the associations between a history of interpersonal trauma and pain, treatment outcomes, and healthcare experiences of women and individuals assigned female at birth who have been diagnosed with chronic pelvic pain. This population faces challenges navigating the healthcare system, and reports experiences of invalidation from healthcare providers because chronic pain is often misunderstood. By asking patients and healthcare providers directly about their experiences of receiving and  delivering care, their perspectives on how personal history is considered when planning treatment, and what they identify as facilitators and barriers to providing trauma-informed gynecologic care, we hope to develop guidelines to help improve the practice of gynecology and its outcomes."
Technology-driven mental health data collection mechanisms for older adults,"['Cosco, Theodore D']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Data Collection', 'Ehealth', 'Mhealth', 'Technology']",,383018,"Worldwide, there is an unprecedented and ongoing expansion of both the (i) proportion of older adults in society, and (ii) innovations in digital technology. Within the next three decades the number of older adults (aged 65 years and above) will outnumber children (aged 15 and younger). This shift in the population age structure has myriad implications for healthcare, as increasing numbers of individuals requiring care put greater demands on already heavily burdened healthcare systems. In order to address these challenges, we must look to innovative ways of studying the processes of aging. The breadth, depth, and granularity of information available through technology-driven data collection and analysis mechanisms has the potential to improve our capacity to research, understand, and address the implications of an aging population. However, whilst there is also great opportunity in harnessing these technologies, there are equally as many challenges. Notably, older adults may experience the first-level digital divide, i.e. lack of access to technologies, and/or the second-level digital divide, i.e. lack of use/skill. In order to harness the numerous benefits of these innovative research methods and techniques, we must first engage older adults in a meaningful way and adjust the framework of traditional mHealth smart devices for the unique physiological and psychological characteristics of the aging populace. Through an informed approach to the development of technologies with older adults in mind, the hope is that we can leverage these innovations to increase the quality and quantity of life experienced by the growing population of older adults."

Mental illnesses, such as depression or anxiety, may include feelings of hopelessness, helplessness, guilt, or even suicide.
Worldwide, mental illness affects one in five people aged 60+. However, problems faced by older adults impacting their mental health are often overlooked, such as loneliness, loss of a spouse, or ill-health. We need to change the way we treat mental health, with services that consider older adults' specific needs and situations.
""Precision medicine"" means using information we learn about someone, such their diet or lifestyle, to provide treatment/care specific to them as an individual. This has been successful with physical illnesses, such as early-diagnosis and treatment for cancer. We want to apply these ideas to help improve older adults' mental health.
Motion sensing technologies are being developed that are able to able to collect information about older adults' movements that can be used in the identification of mental illnesses. However, we do not yet know what older adults think about these technologies and if they are willing to these sensors into their homes. To ensure our system and services/technologies meet older adults' needs and are easy-to-use, older adults will be involved at all stages of the project from early ideas, to building/testing the services/technologies. To do this, we will host a workshop that will bring together experts who design these sensors and older adults who will be using them. By the end of this workshop we hope to have identified technologies that the engineers can design, the older adults are happy with, and that are able to collect the data required to use a precision medicine approach to mental health."

In line with this goal, our project proposes an open-house event hosted by the Precision Mental Health Lab. This event aims to bring together diverse participants and gather their valuable insights on research questions, emerging issues, and priorities that truly matter to them. By doing so, we aim to create a more democratic and inclusive mental health research landscape.
Our pre-event planning includes conducting a needs assessment survey, targeted outreach initiatives, and collaborative design to ensure that the event aligns with participants' expectations and interests. This sets the stage for an engaging and empowering program that we hope will inspire all involved.
By enhancing collaborative research, we can work towards co-developing a research portfolio that facilitates better mental health outcomes for older adults. Ensuring research aligns with community needs, facilitating knowledge exchange through workshops and stakeholder consultations, empowering researchers and practitioners with firsthand community insights, and optimizing the utilization of resources by directing research efforts towards identified priorities we hope to articulate a road map for future research projects.

The first objective is to assess the impact of crime in the broad sense on the mental health of MVPs. A secondary objective is to identify modifiable neighbourhood-level features associated with crime and safety, and related inequities in mental health. Neighbourhood crime may impact mental health through three key processes: direct exposure (i.e., as a victim), indirect exposure (i.e., witnessing neighbourhood crime and disorder), and through contact with the criminal justice process as a victim, criminalized person, or their family member (i.e., procedurally). This research integrates socioepidemiological, sociological and criminological theories, and adopts an intersectional approach (i.e., assessing impacts by age, gender and racioethnic group). Measures of mental health will be obtained from the Canadian Community Health Survey (2015-2017) and the Social and Psychiatric Epidemiology Catchment Area of the South West of Montreal (ZEPSOM) study (2014). Ego-centered measures of neighbourhood exposures will be derived using data from CANUE, Statistics Canada and Données Ouvertes Montréal. Novel measures of neighbourhood hostility and policing will be developed by combining these data sources. Advanced quantitative methods will be used to adjust for clustering of data, assess direct and indirect effects, and differential effects at the individual and neighbourhood-level. The results will provide the first comprehensive assessment of the impacts of exposure to crime, in the broad sense, on mental health, speak to the differential impacts for MVPs, and identify modifiable  features to reduce mental health inequities."

Point estimates in the past decade suggest that at least 20% of children will have a mental health problem in any given year, and the rates are as high as 36.7% when considering the risk of having at least one disorder by age 16 years. Preventive measures are less costly and intrusive than curative ones, which explains why prevention has been adopted in many societies. Recent research has shown that most mental health problems have their roots early in life. But most studies have not searched for the roots of mental health problems as early as the preschool years. This research project will examine the development of Mental Health Problems (MHPs) from birth to adolescence (14-16 years) among a population cohort (the Québec Longitudinal Study on Child Development, N=1979). The study is likely to fill a significant gap in health research as it will provide unique information on the relative role of the first 5 years (versus later years) of life in the development of mental health problems among a representative population cohort. The project will address 2 main questions: (1) Are symptoms of mental health problems during early and middle childhood predictive of mental health problems in adolescence? (2) What are the contributions of risk and protective factors to the prediction of mental health problems in adolescence? The study, with its focus on the comparison of the timing of risk factors, will generate knew knowledge on how risk and protective factors work together over the first 16 years of life.

The prevalence of mental health problems in children and adolescents is even higher than previously thought, with rates as high as 36.7% when considering the risk of having at least one disorder by age 16 years. Recent research has shown that most mental health problems have their roots early in life. But most studies have not searched for the roots of mental health problems as early as the preschool years. The overall aim of this research project is to assess the mental health of a population cohort (N=1979) of adolescents born in 1997-1998 and followed-up prospectively between the ages of 5 months and 12 years - the Participants in the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD) - in order to address two important questions: 1. How much continuity is there in mental health problems across early and middle childhood and adolescence, 2. What are the  contributions of perinatal, family, peer and educational risk factors at different developmental periods for the development of mental health problems? At the age of 13 and 15 years, QLSCD adolescents will be interviewed individually at their school by a trained research assistant about their mental health, their relationships with their parents, friends and their school environment. 
The present study, with its focus on the comparison of the timing of risk factors, will generate knew knowledge on how the risk factors work together over the first 15 years of life. The result will refine our knowledge of the risk factors that should be the target of preventive intervention at specific developmental periods and for specific mental health problems."
Effectiveness of Interventions in Early Daycare to Prevent Disruptive Behaviours in Children of Low-Income Neighbourhoods (I-CARE): A 2x2 Factorial Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial.,"['Côté, Sylvana', 'Mâsse, Benoît R']","['Booij, Linda', 'Brendgen, Rosemarie M', 'Capuano, France', 'Geoffroy, Marie-Claude', 'Herba, Catherine M', 'Ouellet-Morin, Isabelle', 'Provencal, Nadine', 'Tremblay, Richard E', 'Vitaro, Frank']","['Biomarkers', 'Disruptive Behaviours Problems', 'Early Childhood Education', 'Early Childhood Intervention In Daycares', 'Longitudinal Study', 'Mental Health', 'Parenting Skills', 'Preventive Intervention', 'Randomized Control Trial', 'Social Skills Training']",937125.0,381247,"Disruptive behaviour problems (DBPs) violate social norms and generate high costs to society. Adults with DBPs have problems ranging from mental health issues to substance abuse, spousal abuse, depression, and suicide. 
Disruptive behaviours begin in early childhood. Toddlers do not know how to express and meet their needs, so they may kick, hit, scream, and fight. As they grow older, they learn more acceptable ways to obtain what they want and disruptive behaviours fade away. 
Studies in the USA in the 1960s-80s show that child care-based interventions with parental support have long-term positive impacts in low-income neighbourhoods. In Canada today, where healthcare is universally available and daycare use is common, the same conditions do not necessarily apply. We need information on which interventions work best for low-income families in real-life situations and which are the most cost-effective. For example, parenting skills interventions are 3 times more expensive than daycare-based programs. Daycares are essentially preschools where parents send their children during working hours. 
We will conduct a trial comparing 3 different programs to reduce disruptive behaviour in 2-4-year-olds in daycare. We will enrol 80 daycares, i.e. about 1280 toddlers. Daycares will be randomly selected to receive one of the following: 1) training of educators to improve social skills in daycare; 2) at-home training for parents of the most disruptive children; 3) daycare and home-based training; and 4) a control group with daycare services as usual. Daycares will be chosen from low-income areas in Greater Montreal and Sherbrooke (Quebec). The program will last 2 years and then be evaluated. A biobank of saliva and hair samples will also be kept and analysed to test markers of disruptive behaviour and to measure improvement. Results will help decision-makers set up evidence-based best practice programs that are both useful and cost-effective and can be applied on a larger scale"

Youth with MHPs such as substance abuse, antisocial behaviour, and depression are at high risk for school failure, unemployment and continued mental health problems. Our goal is to generate knowledge to improve the prevention of the heavy social, personal and economic burden of MHPs. Research on MHPs indicates that many MHPs have roots early in life and persist across the lifespan. Therefore, risk factors for MHPs should be studied from early childhood onwards. In addition, although poverty or coercive parenting are important risk factors for MHPs, most children exposed to such risks do not develop MHPs. Finally, some children benefit from receiving psychosocial services to prevent MHPs, while others do not. To better understand the interplay between risk factors and improve the effectiveness of preventive efforts, we need to understand the sequence of risk factors for adult MHPs as they unfold between birth and adulthood, as well as the reasons for the wide variations in responses to risks or services. Our objectives are to identify 1) which risk factors for adult MHPs emerge at which point in time, and how they co-develop over the life course, 2) for whom environmental factors are more likely to lead to MHPs, and 3) for whom the use of childhood psychosocial services can be most beneficial. In order to do so, we will assess MHPs at age 20 years (2017) in a uniquely well-documented Canadian population-based cohort (n=1979) assessed repeatedly since birth. Importance. This research will provide information on 'for whom' childhood risk factors lead to MHPs and 'for whom' psychosocial services are most beneficial. Because this project will collect reliable and clinically relevant data on MHPs in a Canadian cohort studied extensively since birth, the return on investment will be high."

In Canada, since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, pregnant women have reported levels of depression 2-3 times higher than pre-pandemic levels. We are facing an unprecedented need for psychological support for an already vulnerable population. Accordingly, we have adapted an evidence-based program for the prevention of perinatal depression to a virtual and partner-inclusive format appropriate for social distancing. Our objective is to test the efficacy of the virtual Parents & Babies intervention, a prevention program based on workbook and/or online exercises as well as weekly telephone calls. The program begins in pregnancy and continues until the first 3 months after the baby's birth. We will enrol 640 women for whom an intervention is indicated; i.e. those presenting symptoms of depression in early pregnancy. Our program recognizes the importance of partner support for maternal mental health, and partner participation is encouraged. Our multidisciplinary team includes researchers/clinicians from public health, psychiatry, psychology, obstetrics, nursing, and economics, with extensive clinical expertise in perinatal mental health and child development. We have already completed a pilot study. The clinical team and research infrastructure are ready and in place. Virtual, or remote, care is a promising solution to longstanding barriers to treatment. If effective, the intervention offered at a critical period in maternal, fetal and infant development and during a stressful pandemic period, could become a population-based health promotion tool for Canadian families and implemented elsewhere in the world."

Characterizing vascular health in female nurses in the Champlain region of Ontario.,"['Cotie, Lisa M']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,352434,"The number one killer of females over the age of 35 is cardiovascular disease (CVD). Nurses are a predominately female population, with many self-reporting having diabetes, high cholesterol and blood pressure and being overweight; all known risk factors for CVD. Artery health is a predictor of future CVD events. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to measure and describe the artery health of female nurses from 11 rural/urban hospitals in the Champlain region of Ontario. One hundred and sixty females (mean±SD = age: 43.7±12.4 years; body mass index (BMI): 27.4±5.4kg/m2; waist circumference (WC): 80.8±11.7cm) were included in this study. Two percent of the nurses reported taking medications for diabetes, 3% for high cholesterol and 8% for high blood pressure. Nine percent were smokers, 54% were overweight and 74% were not meeting the current Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines (CPAG) (>/150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity/week in bouts >/ 10 minutes). Six percent (n=10) of the nurses presented with poor artery health (30-39 years: normative value = 6.5m/s, 2 nurses above 6.5m/s; 40-49 years: normative value = 7.2m/s, 5 nurses above 7.2m/s; and, 50-59 years: normative value = 8.3m/s, 3 nurses above 8.3m/s). Among the nurses with poor artery health, 10% reported taking medications for high cholesterol and 40% for high blood pressure. Ten percent were smokers and 88% were not meeting the current CPAG. They also had significantly higher BMI (32.7±5.9 kg/m2 vs. 27.0±5.29 kg/m2, p=0.013) and WC (95.0±11.4 cm vs. 79.9±11.2 cm, p=0.002) when compared with those with normal artery health. Despite reporting chronic conditions known to be risk factors for CVD, smoking and failing to meet CPAG, few (6%) female nurses in the Champlain region of Ontario appear to present with poor artery health. This study provides valuable data regarding the artery health of female nurses and may inform future interventions targeting CVD risk in this population."
Dietary phytoestrogen intake and the risk of breast cancer according to estrogen- and progesterone-receptor (ERPR) subgroup,"['Cotterchio, Michelle']","['Boucher, Beatrice', 'Kirsh, Victoria', 'Kreiger, Nancy', 'Thompson, Lilian U']","['Breast Cancer', 'Cancer Prevention', 'Case-Control Study', 'Diet', 'Etiology']",38296.0,182200,"Phytoestrogens are plant-based compounds that resemble estrogen in structure. Two main phytoestrogen classes (isoflavones, lignans) are found in commonly eaten foods (such as soy, flaxseed, fruits, vegetables) and supplements consumed by Canadians. There is evidence that phytoestrogens eaten by women may reduce a woman's risk of breast cancer. However, this may be true for only some types of breast cancer and for some women. The causes of breast cancer seem to be different according to whether breast tumour cells contain receptors for estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) hormones. Thus, studies that treated breast cancer as a single entity (i.e., with no stratification based on ER/PR status), may be modest, inconsistent, and attenuated. Classification of breast tumours according to ER/PR status may help to elucidate the causes of breast cancer because ER/PR subgroups of breast cancer may have differing etiologies. This study will analyze two kinds of information not often available for the same women: information on estrogen and progesterone receptors and information on the dietary intake of phytoestrogens. We will compare women with different types of breast cancer, marked by different levels of these hormone receptors, to women without breast cancer to find out more about how diet may contribute to the prevention of breast cancer. Questionnaire data including dietary information about phytoestrogen intake was recently collected in a large Ontario breast cancer case-control study (greater than 6,000 participants) and we will link this dietary data with ER/PR tumour information we propose to obtain from breast cancer pathology reports. The proposed cost efficient study will be larger and more comprehensive than previously published studies. The first step towards the prevention of breast cancer is to fully understand the causes (etiology) of breast cancer. This research will help to elucidate the etiology of breast cancer and is important since diet is modifiable."

Causes of pancreatic cancer are poorly understood. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting history of allergies may be associated with reduced pancreas cancer risk. This finding is intriguing and  must be further explored to help provide insight into the causes of  pancreas cancer.  The proposed study will improve upon the previous studies and will obtain detailed information on specific allergies and medication taken for allergies. Also, it is possible that the reduced cancer risk may be due to common underlying genetic factors whereby inherited genetic variants may be associated with both increased susceptibility to allergies and reduced risk for pancreas cancer; thus, we will investigate this. We propose a case-control study design, using pancreas cancer patients (cases) (800) identified using the Ontario Cancer Registry (OCR) and persons without cancer (controls) (1600).  Recently the OCR implemented an electronic reporting system so as to obtain pathology reports (indicating cancer diagnosis) very rapidly - this is crucial for the study of fatal pancreas cancer and this will enhance our study design. Questionnaires (allergies, medications, diet, etc) will be mailed to participants along with a saliva collection kit.  DNA from saliva samples will be analysed in a laboratory to detect common variations in many immune system genes. Statistical analyses will be performed to compare the risk of pancreas cancer among persons with and without these genetic variants, and to compare, the risk of pancreas cancer among those who have allergies compared to those that have no allergy history.  Understanding the role that allergic diseases and genes involved in the immune system may play in the development of pancreatic cancer is important given pancreas cancer is extremely fatal, causes are poorly understood, and there is no screening test."

In each of these settings, 2SLGBTQ+ youth experience higher rates of cannabis use, compared to their heterosexual and/or cisgender counterparts across adolescence and young adulthood. Recent research demonstrates that 2SLGBTQ+ also experience disproportionate health inequities in terms of sexual health (e.g., STI/HIV) and mental health (e.g., depression, suicide, anxiety) particularly during the transition from adolescence to young adulthood. While a growing body of evidence indicates that cannabis use can impact sexual health and mental health outcomes, it remains unclear how to effectively implement or adapt various interventions to improve health outcomes among 2SLGBTQ+ youth who use cannabis. To address these knowledge gaps, the proposed study will bring together a new international team of investigators - including a mix of junior and senior researchers and trainees, knowledge users and community partners - to catalyze a program of research that will generate context-sensitive and population-specific evidence to inform cannabis use interventions to improve health outcomes of 2SLGBTQ+ youth who use cannabis. By establishing an international collaboration, we will bring into sharper focus on how features of implementation context (e.g., legal and regulatory status for non-medical cannabis use), health care delivery systems and individual behaviour impact the outcomes of cannabis use interventions to improve health outcomes associated with cannabis use where they have been implemented at different stages and with differential effects."

2. Characterize the experiences and perspectives of youth and health providers to understand how various individual, social, and structural factors influence experiences with and access to DHIs for youth. 
3. Identify how DHIs can best be adapted to optimize positive health outcomes and reduce health inequities among youth.

The proposed study will begin with a scoping review to inventory existing DHIs regarding mental health and substance use for youth in Canada and France (Objective 1). A series of online surveys and qualitative interviews will be conducted in each country to characterize the experiences of youth and providers with DHIs (Objective 2). Two World Cafés in each country will be organized with youth, providers and policy makers to identify recommendations for DHIs (Objective 3).

Factors contributing to the epidemic include poverty, sexually transmitted infections (STI), trafficking of women, widespread patronage of female sex workers (FSW) and a highly mobile workforce. FSW are a high risk group for HIV/STI and often use amphetamine-type substances (ATS). This is a great public health concern since ATS users are usually are more prone to engage in risky sexual behaviours, and thus have a greater risk of STI/HIV infections. In addition, ATS can produce aggressiveness and make their users more susceptible to experience violence. For its part, violence has also been associated with unprotected sexual intercourses and increased risk of HIV/STI infections. Until now, little is known about ATS use among FSW or its effects on HIV/STI acquisition or transmission. 

This project first aims to describe ATS use among FSW working in brothels and entertainment or drinking establishments in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Secondly, the ATS use reported by the FSW will be compared to the ATS drug levels detected in their urine in order to examine the concordance and the validity of self-report. Finally, the study will verify the hypothesis that FSW who use ATS are more susceptible to engage is risky sexual behaviours, be infected by HIV/STI, experience diverse forms of violence, and less likely to adhere to an antiretroviral (ART) treatment against HIV and vaccine schedule for HPV (Human papilloma virus). In order to achieve these objectives, a prospective cohort study will be conducted which will follow FSW for one year, with visits every three months. Findings from this study will help better understand the underlying mechanisms involved in the influence of ATS use on HIV transmission. Also, this study will yield important data on the interactions between transactional sex, drugs, violence and HIV risk, which will help improve current prevention interventions."
A qualitative study of drinking to cope with depression,"['Couture, Marie-Eve']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,324573,"This paper is part of a larger presentation titled 'Novel approaches to understanding and treating comorbid depression and alcohol misuse' which will be presented at a scientific meeting. The presentation will inform attendees of the theories linking depression and problematic alcohol use, will outline the evidence on the potential explanations for this association, and will discuss new ways to prevent and provide treatment to individuals struggling with both depression and alcohol misuse. The research presented will feature results of studies conducted with individuals ranging in age from adolescence to adulthood. The present paper describes the results of an analysis of interviews of individuals in late adolescence and early adulthood who reported drinking to cope with depression. This analysis aimed at identifying the common ways alcohol affects depression in these individuals. 16 participants (12 women and 8 men), aged from 18 to 25 years old who drink to cope with depression were interviewed. The analysis revealed that participants reported effects of alcohol on their thinking, their relationships with others, their mood, their interpretation of events that happened to them, and  their sleep, and reported that some of these effects persisted the day after drinking. These results highlight important treatment targets for psychological interventions designed for young people and aimed at addressing depression and alcohol misuse that occur simultaneously."

De récentes études ont montré que les problèmes reproductifs liés au vieillissement touchent aussi les hommes, chez qui un âge paternel supérieur à 45 ans aurait des effets sur la santé reproductive (plus haut taux d'infertilité et risque accru d'anomalies génétiques ou de trouble de neuro-développement pour l'enfant à naître). Dans le champ de la procréation assistée (PA), ce nouveau phénomène soulève plusieurs enjeux médicaux, sociaux et éthiques et on s'interroge sur l'accompagnement à offrir. Dans la perspective croisée de l'anthropologie médicale et de l'éthique de la reproduction, cette recherche veut étudier comment le rapport infertilité-âge avancé transforme la conception de la paternité, tout en ouvrant sur des enjeux éthiques envers l'enfant à naitre, l'individu, la famille, le personnel médical et la société. L'objectif de cette étude est de mieux comprendre cet aspect du vieillissement masculin en reliant: a) l'expérience socialement et culturellement située d'hommes de plus de 45 ans consultant en infertilité à b) une éthique de la reproduction masculine tardive. Une approche méthodologique qualitative combinant l'ethnographie et l'éthique, permettra d'appréhender les dimensions médicales, sociales et éthiques de ce phénomène émergent. Elle combine 3 outils de collecte de données: a) analyse de la littérature, b) observation participante en clinique de fertilité, c) entrevues semi-dirigées avec des hommes de plus de 45 ans suivis en infertilité. Dans une société vieillissante où la reproduction tardive est en hausse, cette étude veut éclairer un des mécanismes de production sociale de l'infertilité encore peu étudié, en nous informant sur les besoins, les craintes et les espoirs de ces hommes. Elle permettra de développer des outils de sensibilisation aux risques liés à l'âge ainsi qu'un encadrement éthique et médical du recours à la PA par ces hommes."
Understanding the Lived Experiences of Black People with Breast Cancer in Atlantic Canada,"['Covelli, Andrea M', 'Dryden, OmiSoore H']","['Daniel, Juliet M', 'Hamilton-Hinch, Barbara-Ann G', 'Khalil, Ielaf', 'Lofters, Aisha K', 'Naganathan, Gayathri']","['African Nova Scotian', 'Atlantic Canada', 'Black Communities', 'Breast Cancer', 'Breast Cancer Care', 'Breast Cancer Screening', 'Cancer Support Services', 'Healthcare Inequities', 'Marginalized Communities', 'Race']",100000.0,484347,"Although little is known in Canada about the differences in breast cancer incidence and survival in women of different ethnicities/races, reports from the US indicate that there are differences in breast cancer care and survival for Black women. In the US, Black women more often present with advanced and aggressive breast cancer that has spread to other organs and they are less likely to receive treatment. They thus have a worse survival rate from breast cancer and are also more likely to experience delays in care and receive non-standard care. Anecdotal evidence and personal storytelling suggests that in Canada there are also differences in cancer screening, incidence and quality of care for Black people.

Nova Scotia is the birthplace of Black communities in Canada. Anti-Black racism and violence have existed in the region since the introduction of slavery. The history of systemic anti-Black racism contributes to social determinants of health. The unique history and lived experience of these Black communities requires community-based strategies and dedicated efforts to produce high quality evidence.

To have healthy Black communities, we must know more about the healthcare environment in Atlantic Canada and how Black people are being screened and treated for breast cancer. By listening to and understanding the journey and experiences of Black people with breast cancer we can identify the challenges and barriers faced by these individuals and learn about the inequities and biases within the healthcare system.

By engaging with Black communities and listening to the experiences of Black people, we seek to (i) broaden our understanding of how Black people within Atlantic Canada experience breast cancer and identify challenges, barriers, inequities, and inadequacies in care, and (ii) develop actionable strategies and policy recommendations to address systemic racism and current inequities in breast cancer care for communities of African descent in Atlantic Canada."

In addition to having the world's highest number of people living with HIV, South Africa has extremely high rates of violence against women and children. These epidemics work together in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, exacerbating one another.  While many approaches to these problems are targeted at women, there is evidence to show that women in many cases are not sufficiently empowered to act effectively to protect themselves from HIV and violence. I plan to work with Zulu boys and men in rural KwaZulu-Natal to gain an understanding of Zulu concepts of masculinity, so that we can work together to improve rates of HIV/AIDS and violence against women.  I shall use qualitative and quantitative research methods and draw expertise from a number of disciplines to investigate the relationship between masculinity, violence against women, and HIV/AIDS in rural South Africa."

This change has led to an increase in the occurrence of various competing morbidities among HIV-infected populations. This is especially true for hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infected HIV-positive patients. HIV  positive persons who lack access to food appear more susceptible to having difficulties in managing and treating HIV infection. However few studies have studied the relationship of lack of access to food and HIV-HCV co-infection. The research has two objectives. Objective 1 aims at assessing the level of food insecurity (lack of access to food) among co-infected persons and its effect on HIV and HCV behavours and health. Objective 2 aims at exploring, from the perspective of co-infected persons who are food-insecure, issues of resilience and vulnerability, and to describe their needs for food security and their needs for nutrition and health care. To attain these objectives, the research will collect data every six months on food security as part of an ongoing multisite cohort study conducted in in Canada, and will implement a case study that will involve individual interviews. The longitudinal design of this research and its mixed methods approach will provide for new insights on the relationships between food insecurity and HIV-HCV co-infection related behaviours, treatment and health."

GbMSM are also more affected by sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as syphilis.

Antiretroviral (ARV)-based HIV prevention, such as Treatment as Prevention (TasP; screening, ARV treatment and care retention) for HIV-positive individuals and pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV-negative individuals, is changing how we think about preventing HIV and other STIs among gbMSM. The use of these new prevention strategies is expected to vary greatly across Canada because of differing provincial policies affecting availability and access. Also, ARV-based HIV prevention may lead to unforeseen effects such as less condom use and more STIs. 

The Engage Cohort Study will investigate trends in the use of ARV-based HIV prevention by following 1489 HIV-positive and high-risk HIV-negative gbMSM in Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal. Participants will do study visits (questionnaire and HIV/STI screening) every 6 months for three years. The study aims to 1) measure trends in the use of ARV-based HIV prevention, psychosocial-behavioural factors (e.g., experiences of discrimination, substance use, etc.), condom-use, STIs, and HIV and 2) examine relationships between ARV-based HIV prevention and various sexual health outcomes (e.g., occurrence of STIs). Also, because some groups of gbMSM (e.g., transmen) may have unique experiences of ARV-based HIV prevention, interviews will be done in each city to better understand their realities.

The experienced study team will work with community engagement committees and knowledge users in each city to ensure the study is conducted appropriately  and that study results are communicated properly. Doing the Engage Cohort Study now, as ARV-based HIV prevention becomes more available, is an important opportunity to learn how best to use these new prevention strategies in controlling HIV and STI epidemics among gbMSM in Canada."

Engage created the opportunity to foster a rich network of local collaboration between researchers, knowledge users, and community members in Montreal. Data from Engage Montreal has been published by local collaborators in 8 research papers, used to inform local public health responses (e.g. Mpox vaccination intervention), presented in community summary reports and community events (e.g. community engagement committee meetings) and given rise to knowledge translation/transfer (KT) and community mobilization efforts such as infographics.
Given that data collection for Engage Montreal concluded in January 2023, a local meeting is needed to be held to gather researchers, knowledge-users and community members to share an updated and complete summary of salient findings from Engage Montreal, fostering discussions on the usefulness of the data within the context of the communities' needs. This meeting will bookend the ""Preliminary Findings"" meeting Engage Montreal hosted in 2018, one year after data collection began. The Cafe is a critical opportunity to direct final KT efforts based on updated data, and to receive input on future studies and interventions. This will ensure that our work will reach knowledge users to improve access to and uptake of HIV/STBBI prevention services among Montreal GBM. The Cafe is planned to take place in person in late 2023 as a series of moderated panel presentations."
Investigating the 'Quality Chasm': Seniors' Perspectives on Optimizing Chronic Disease Management in Their Communities,"['Cox, Lizebeth M']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Chronic Disease Management', 'Community Health', 'Diabetes', 'Heart Failure', 'Hypertension', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Mobility', 'Osteoporosis', 'Stroke']",44000.0,177964,"With unprecedented population aging and chronic diseases so heavily impacting health system costs and quality of life, chronic disease management has become a priority in Canada and worldwide. Many disease-specific clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) currently exist that attempt to provide evidence-based standards of care for the major chronic conditions affecting Canadians. However, poor compliance and adherence to CPGs, by both patients and family physicians, is an emerging problem. 

The purpose of this population-based study is to investigate the current use of disease-specific CPGs and education programs by both seniors and family physicians and to produce criteria for evaluating the senior-friendliness of these guidelines and programs. 

This research study will consist of 3 phases. 
Phase 1 will examine the extent to which the use of disease-specific CPGs by family physicians and the chronic disease management practices of seniors converge by conducting a survey with family physicians and focus groups with seniors. 
Phase 2 will examine the obstacles encountered by seniors when visiting and discussing their chronic diseases with family physicians and the mobility issues seniors face in caring for their chronic conditions by conducting both a survey and mobility-specific interviews with seniors who have at least one chronic disease, in 5 seniors' communities in London. 
Phase 3 will use the knowledge gained in phases 1 and 2 to develop criteria to guide the development of senior-friendly guidelines and/or chronic disease education programs. 

Ultimately, the active engagement of seniors in learning about their chronic diseases, and in reviewing and providing feedback on available CPGs, will produce a set of criteria that will make disease-specific CPG recommendations more practical and senior-friendly and will begin to address the chronic disease management gap between recommended care and actual care."

These tools use what a Mi'gmag elder called a 'Two Eyed Seeing' (TES) approach combining a traditional perspective and a scientific one. These tools have been effective in reducing the prevalence of FASD and related conditions. Currently, the Eastern Door team is working to integrate nutrition and iron deficiency (ID) related information into their TES Medicine Wheel Screening and Intervention Tools. 
 
In Canada, 13% of females 12-19 and 9% of females 20-49 years old have ID. Data from Inuit and Cree First Nations communities have shown that the prevalence of ID was 53%, with 36% of the children having ID-anemia. Recent data from Quebec shows that 15% of pregnant women do not meet iron intake requirements. On the other hand, children and youth with mental health and neurodevelop¬mental conditions often demonstrate disruptive sleep-/wake-behaviours that are closely associated with ID, e.g. ADHD or insomnia. In addition, animal studies implicate ID as aggravating the toxic effects of prenatal alcohol exposure. Clinically, iron supplementation is a known but often underutilized therapeutic option. The applicants believe that early identification and individualized clinical management of ID may have the potential to become part of prevention-based care in First Nations communities.
 
This project will further promote the development and dissemination of culturally sensitive assessment and intervention tools that will explore life-style related factors contributing to ID and enable a proactive community based nutritional focus to promote the health and well being of youth and families in Elsipogtog and other Indigenous communities in Canada."

The Eastern Door multi-disciplinary team model in Elsipogtog First Nations (FN) has been operating for 12 years; they have successfully undertaken community research using the expertise of traditional healers in the community as well as local health and educational professionals. Evidence shows that community research using this collaborative 'two-eyed seeing' model has worked to improve children's health and well-being in the community. Education and health directors in the largest Wabanaki communities have expressed their support for developing local capacity using the Eastern Door multi-disciplinary team model. At this point in time the FN communities have the capacity to form clinical research teams; many of the team members have roots in their respective FN communities. The clinical teams in each community, employing the 'two-eyed seeing' multi-disciplinary team model, would serve as structures to support the Wabanaki network research and improve local clinical practice. Developing the research capacity of local health and educational professionals will help successfully develop a viable network. This grant will give us the opportunity to gather together to articulate our shared vision and then find points of collaboration. Finding sources of core funding will be key in ultimately building a sustainable FN children's health network of all FN communities in the region. This preliminary work will lead us to prepare a full NEIHR grant application and presentation of our project at a gathering to be held within the year."

Traditionally, EOL care decisions have been made by proxy decision-makers, with or without the PWD's input. Yet, research has shown a disconnect between what a proxy might decide and what a PWD might prefer, suggesting that how these conversations occur (or not) influences the outcome of the decision. This project adopts the lenses of shared decision-making, feminist care ethics and social citizenship to look at how PWD could become active collaborators in shaping EOL decision-making. The study goals are to explore and PWDs' perceptions of what it means to live well to the EOL and to develop effective methods of sharing these findings and creating dialogue with the Canadian public. The study will involve in-depth interviews with persons with early-moderate stages of dementia and an informal caregiver and a series of visioning workshops where participants will use arts-based methods (such as collage, painting or creation of poetry) to explore their values and preferences for living well with dementia to the EOL. The works created will be exhibited in spaces where the public, policy makers, and healthcare providers can engage in dialogue about 'having the EOL conversation' and about what it means to live well with dementia to the EOL. This work will enhance understanding of the views of PWD in discussions about living well to the EOL and contribute to the development of approaches that support PWD in communicating about their preferences."

Of special importance is the lack of nationwide epidemiological data. Given this growing concern and the paucity of research on the topic, our work will investigate trends in methamphetamine use in Canada.  Specifically, we will examine geographic, sociodemographic, and temporal trends of methamphetamine use, as well as trends in polysubstance abuse. We will also quantify corresponding health care utilization and hospital costs to understand the national economic impact. Our study will use a nationally representative Canadian cohort, which will provide the most comprehensive and up to date figures of epidemiological trends on methamphetamine use in Canada. In order to lay the groundwork for successful interventions at all levels (including treatment, harm reduction, and at the levels of health service systems), epidemiological studies using large, current, and representative samples are urgently needed."

Canada has one of the highest rates of MS globally and it is estimated that the number of people living with MS in Canada will increase to approximately 33,600 in 2031. MS mainly affects people between 15 and 40 years of age, placing a significant strain not only on patients in the prime of their life, but also on the healthcare system. 

Although there is no cure for MS, there are treatments available to help manage episodes of increased disability (relapses), reduce relapses, and control symptoms. Treatment with drugs known as interferon-betas were the first medications for MS and being the only promising therapeutic option initially for many years, treatment selection was limited. An increasing number of new treatments have emerged since then, however, there are limited evidence based guidelines concerning the use and selection of treatments for the various disease states of MS. Additionally, while there have been many studies that have identified specific
independent risk factors for patient health outcomes, no study to date has attempted to combine these patient, disease, and treatment-related factors into a complete model to enhance the prediction of how patients will respond to treatment and whether or not they will improve. 

The objective of this study is to use patient data from provincial healthcare records as well as clinical data collected over an extended time period to develop and test of a series of predictive models in MS, and make these models freely available on a web-based platform.
Ultimately, these models will help guide the selection of the best therapeutic approach for each individual, which will improve decision-making at the patient level. In addition, these predictions should result in better patient care as well as a more efficient and cost-effective
use of healthcare resources."

In the first CIHR-SSHRC-supported phase of the research, we analysed correlates and trends related to workplace violence. In this second phase of the research, we will focus on STBBI risk. We will statistically analyse social and structural correlates of unprotected sex at work using our existing data. We will then further analyse the correlates of unprotected sex at work and of shared injection material among a restricted sample of injection drug-using sex workers. Following this, we will undertake 30 semi-structured interviews in three of our research sites with injection-drug-using sex workers to explore in depth 1. the dynamics shaping their risk environments for STBBIs under end-demand legislation 2. how they navigate and attempt to mitigate these risks under end-demand legislation."

Traditional media (i.e. television, movies, magazines, radio, etc.) continues to change with the rapid increase in popularity of new, digital media (i.e. internet, social networking, file sharing, etc.) available on far more portable devices (i.e. laptops, smartphones, tablets, MP3 players, etc.), offering adolescents access to virtually anything and everything through the internet (Brown & Bobkowski, 2011).

A debate continues to rage over new media and its use by adolescents. One argument is that new media provides helps youth learn, supports socialization and encourages responsibility (Pascoe, 2011, p.6). The opposing argument is that new media is negative or problematic, making adolescents isolated, distracted, vulnerable, exploitable, and exposing them to inappropriate, undesirable, or adult content (Gray, 2009; Hillier & Harrison, 2007; Pascoe, 2011; Veenhof et al., 2008). 

For queer youth new media may offer resources and learning opportunities; foster social, psychological, and emotional support; develop skills and experiences which may be transferred into offline life; and provide space to rehearse crucial developmental tasks (Alexander & Losh, 2010; Hillier & Harrison, 2007). Yet, research has also suggested that new media may place queer youth at particular risk (Pascoe, 2011).

Studies have also shown that misusing substances places teens at risk for developing depression.  Parent relationships have been shown to play a role in protecting adolescents from developing both substance misuse and depression.  The proposed research will examine the relationship between substance use (i.e. alcohol and drug use) and depression while examining the influence of parental factors (i.e. support, warmth) during adolescents using population-based surveys such as the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY).

The focus of this grant is on peers. Childrens experiences of support and acceptance from friends and their sense of belonging to peer communities are critical to their development of relationship capacity and well being. Conversely, the destructive dynamics within bullying relationships undermine healthy development and may lead to addictive behaviours. We postulate that victimized children are engaged in unhealthy relationships and destructive peer processes. They learn to avoid members of their peer communities, lack friends, and are isolated and marginalized to avoid future victimization. As bullying persists, they are increasingly isolated and excluded from the peer community. If victimized children have friends and constructive peer processes, their friends serve to reduce the negative consequences of bullying and enhance well-being and reduce addictive behaviours. Children who bully are also marginalized from the mainstream peer group and tend to have friends who are similarly aggressive. Isolation from the mainstream peer group may limit positive social interactions with prosocial peers. This lack of constructive peer interactions may lead to unhealthy outcomes and reduced opportunities to develop relationship capacity. Victimized youth may attempt to meet their need for close peer relationships by integrating into other peer communities, such as on the internet. There is limited research on how virtual peer communities can compensate for the face-to-face peer community. Research has not been conducted on the benefits or harm of virtual relationships for youth involved in bullying. An original contribution of this research is to consider the destructive and constructive processes of virtual peers."

Problematically, PHPs rarely counsel patients about other toxicants despite evidence of risks, patient demand and the proliferation of potentially harmful advice. Given the importance of reducing exposures and the crucial role PHPs play in counselling patients, the goal of this project is to understand the factors that promote and inhibit uptake of prenatal environmental health preventive care activities across diverse prenatal care, community, occupational and environmental health contexts in Canada. To address this we will first conduct a national survey of reproductive-aged women to assess environmental health knowledge, attitudes, protective practices and educational preferences. This will be followed by a national survey of PHPs to examine their environmental health knowledge, attitudes, clinical practices, experiences and patient education opportunities and barriers. Finally, we will carry out focus groups with a) patients and b) PHPs to identify and examine the suitability of education strategies for diverse clinical, community, occupational and environmental contexts. Our multidisciplinary team is comprised of experts in reproductive health and clinical care, environmental health and health education and we are partnered with key prenatal care and environmental health organizations. This project will directly influence Canadian policy and practice and it represents a critical step toward ensuring that PHPs are equipped to effectively counsel patients, and that patients have the information they need to make informed choices during pregnancy."
"Bridging gaps in Tuberculosis (TB) research: Developing statistical, computational, and information visualization tools for the interpretation of large-scale genomic and population datasets to improve TB prevention and control in British Columbia","['Crisan, Anamaria']",['N/A'],"['Big Data', 'Bioinformatics', 'Genomics', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Tuberculosis', 'Visualization']",105000.0,327828,"Tuberculosis (TB) is a significant public health concern world-wide, responsible for 1.3 million deaths in 2012 alone.
Given that new therapeutics are few and far between for TB, the battle against this re-emerging disease is likely to be
won on the data front. Those regions capable of harnessing laboratory, genomic and clinical data describing their TB
cases will be the best equipped to apply interventions that prevent outbreaks. British Columbia (BC) has amongst the
highest rates of TB incidence within Canada. Canadian-born individuals account for one-third of all TB cases, with the
majority of these in homeless individuals or aboriginal communities. The remaining two-thirds of TB occurs amongst
immigrants to BC arriving from high-incidence countries. To improve TB prevention and control, researchers at the BC
Centre for Disease Control have designed two parallel translational studies, whose results will feed directly into public
health policy. The first will characterize TB transmission within BC using the genomic, clinical and population data from
TB cases over a 15-year period; the second will analyse ~1 million records of immigrants to BC with asymptomatic TB
and identify risk factors for developing symptomatic TB. These two studies will generate millions of data points.
Methods for analyzing such large scale genomic and population datasets, however, do not exist or are untested in the
public health context. Furthermore, to translate research findings into policy, data must be communicated to teams of
specialists with diverse backgrounds. To aid these TB studies, I will develop data analysis methods, tools and
visualizations for large-scale epidemiological analysis. The methods will combine the techniques of ""big data analysis""
with domain-specific genomic and epidemiological tools. Finally, to communicate research findings effectively, I will
design visualization tools to promote faster and easier translation of results to knowledge users and stakeholders."

CMV drivers are subjected to long work hours, high stress, and fatigue which is associated with a wide variety of medical risk risk factors (e.g. hypertension, poor diet, lack of exercise, poor sexual practices) and conditions (e.g. cardiovascular disorders, sleep apnea, muscokoskeletal disorders). Additionally, CMV drivers are at a higher risk for falls and motor vehicle accidents. Consequently, CMV drivers have high workers compensation claims and health care costs. Unfortunately, this population is under-studied and little research has been done in Canada. The purpose of presentation is to discuss relevant literature within a Canadian context on CMV drivers, as well as discussing findings from an environmental scan on programs and services offered to CMV drivers to improve their health. Additionally, we will report findings from focus groups with key stakeholders in the CMV industry. Ultimately, this presentation will serve to highlight the need to pursue research in this population."

The first report, prepared in 2014, included a literature review concerning the health and wellness concerns of commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers. The findings show that CMV drivers are older, enter the profession in their late 40's or early 50's, and have multiple risk factors (i.e., smoking, obesity, hypertension, poor diet, lack of exercise and sleep) that can lead to various medical conditions (i.e., cardiovascular disorders, diabetes) and adverse events (i.e., crashes and falls). However, only a few of these studies reported findings on Canadian CMV drivers. 
The second report, prepared in March 2015, included the development of research and stakeholder advisory committees, an environmental scan of programs and interventions, and focus groups with stakeholders to determine the current situation in Canada. Several themes emerged from the stakeholder consultation: 1) there is little knowledge of existing programs or services offered by CMV companies towards their employees that address health and wellness; 2) There is a need to collect information that characterizes the Canadian CMV population. 
A national study is warranted to collect data on trucking companies and health risk factors in CMV drivers to guide the development, implementation and examination of health and wellness programs that have high potential for efficacy, effectiveness and efficiency, as well as feasibility and acceptability. Collecting this data will provide an understanding of the Canadian CMV population and foster the development of interventions that will aim to reduce risk factors related to cardiovascular and musculoskeletal disease, as well as work related accidents. The planning grant will bring together researchers and stakeholders (i.e., policy makers, organizations and drivers) to plan the development of a national study to improve the health of the CMV sector."

Over the past few years, government and stakeholder organizations have developed strategies to address the HIV crisis, however, little action has been taken primarily from lack of resources and expertise to carry out research/evaluation related activities. The School of Public Health (SPH) at the University of Saskatchewan has access to many resources and is strategically located in Saskatoon, where many HIV cases are reported. By merging the expertise of the SPH with provincial stakeholders and community partners, action can be taken. This planning grant serves to bring stakeholders (e.g. Health Authorities; the Ministry of Health; Health Canada's First Nations and Inuit Health Branch; members of community-based organizations and community groups; members of First Nations communities; health care and service providers; academia, and peers living with HIV) together to plan the collection of data to inform policy development and program/service improvement.

This ""revolving door"" phenomenon comes at a high cost to the mentally ill and to society at large. Our study will examine what happens to the severely mentally ill who are judged not criminally responsible on account of their mental disorder (NCRMD) as they leave hospitals and try to reintegrate into the community. We will interview them and their families at discharge, with follow-ups 6 and 12 months later, as well as review their medical and criminal records. We are particularly interested in the things that support this reintegration ('strengths'), leading to a healthy life, and factors that frustrate the process ('risks'), leading to recidivism and re-arrest.  Examples of strengths are strong family ties, available housing, jobs, and community support services; weaknesses include the absence of these, as well as issues like alcohol/drug abuse, social stigma, and personality disorders.  The study will improve the chances of success for these marginalized people and provide valuable insights into coordination across the health, social services, and criminal justice systems, with prospects of significant cost reductions."

First, under what circumstances and in what manner should evidence-based mental health promotion and violence prevention programs be adapted for First Nations and other Aboriginal populations, and how can the impact of these adaptations be appropriately evaluated? Second, how can we best design, implement, and support evidence-based programming in schools and communities in such a way that maximizes the fidelity and sustainability of programming? These issues are being investigated through three research directions. The first direction is the evaluation of an evidence-based program for youth that has been adapted and expanded for use with First Nations youth. This program is being rigorously evaluated in southwestern Ontario and more formatively evaluated in Northwest Territories and Nunavut. The second research direction is an evaluation of the acceptability, feasibility, effectiveness and scalability of the Mental Health First Aid course that has been developed specifically for a First Nations context and has been implemented in three communities. The third research direction is an evaluation of the barriers and successes involved with a province-wide implementation in Alberta of an evidence-based program for adolescents. Across all three of these directions there is a commitment to work closely with decision-makers and knowledge users to ensure relevant information and useful tools emerge from the research process."

Similar to regular first aid, the goal is not to turn individuals into health care providers, but to give them the skills to recognize a potential mental health crisis and intervene in a way that ensures safety until trained professionals are available. It is currently used across Canada, including in First Nations communities; however, previous evaluation in First Nations in Alberta found a critical need to culturally adapt the course. Over the past two years the Mental Health Commission of Canada (MHCC) has worked with consultants and community partners to adapt the MHFA program to be more culturally appropriate. The adapted program (MHFA-FN) is currently being piloted in three First Nations communities. The pilot process ends in March 2013, but the MHCC is committed to continuing to support the program in those three communities and begin to scale it up to other communities. The proposed research will use a combination of interviews, focus groups, implementation tracking, and surveys to study the implementation of this adapted course and whether it is acceptable to the communities, feasible to implement, and effective in changing attitudes and skills similar to the original course. The research will provide an important evidence base for MHFA-FN as it begins to be scaled up. The evaluation will also look at process issues such as what factors increase a community's readiness for the course, and to what extent communities further localize the adapted course. The impact of this research process will go beyond MHFA-FN and document challenges and successes of the adaptation process that can help other organizations who are seeking to adapt evidence-based practices for First Nations contexts."

Others are spouses, partners, and friends who provide informal care for them while abroad. This CIHR Planning Grant is focused on undertaking the first steps towards building a program of research designed to look at the role of community and social network building when snowbirds with dementia are abroad, along with their informal carers, as a way of facilitating or enhancing quality of life. This includes looking at if and how they incorporate formal health care providers into their networks while abroad and/or maintain contact with their regular care providers in Canada while wintering elsewhere. Our activities will take place in Yuma, Arizona. Yuma is a small town that doubles in size during the snowbird season and many thousands of retired Canadians spend their winter months there. Our activities will include speaking with Canadians managing dementia who are wintering in Yuma along with their informal caregivers, talking with leaders in in the local snowbird community, visiting residential communities frequented by Canadians, and touring health service sites. These activities will assist us in identifying a network of collaborators for our planned CIHR Project Grant submission and will enable us to develop meaningful, engaged research objectives. We will also involve a graduate trainee in all of our activities in order to build capacity in health-related aging and qualitative brain health research."

These relationships are informed by historical and contemporary forms of structural violence, racism and discrimination. Many Indigenous women face multiple barriers accessing health care and are often reluctant to utilize services based on past negative experiences. Additionally, Indigenous women have been relegated to the periphery of Indigenous life and politics. More specifically, colonial states such as, Canada and United States, attempted to wipe out Indigenous communities by radically altering the roles and responsibilities of Indigenous women to be submissive and domesticated. These settler colonial processes have permeated Indigenous Nations, leading to internalization of gendered violence. To more fully capture issues from the perspectives of Indigenous women, is important for inquiries, especially those concerned with maternal healthcare services, to consider the impacts of gendered violence. While these health care barriers have been described, how these dynamics can be mitigated has not been studied. This study seeks to understand the relationships between registered nurses and Indigenous women during a time of reconciliation, with the goal of improving maternal health experiences and outcomes for Blackfoot women. A theoretical framework of Critical Indigenous Feminism and a Blackfoot Indigenous research methodology will guide this exploratory sequential Indigenous mixed-methods research study. It will include the perspectives of RNs and Blackfoot women about maternal-child community- and hospital-based care across prenatal and postnatal periods. Shedding light on the current challenges in maternal health practices and co-designing an innovative study with Blackfoot women and RNs will identify what matters most to Blackfoot women living in Blackfoot territory and help present solutions for culturally safe maternal health practices."

Given the nature of public health and the need to respond quickly to emerging threats, evidence often needs to be translated and applied rapidly.  When responding to a novel virus, policies are set under time constraints and uncertainty which can limit the ability to control the outbreak and result in unintended consequences, such as lack of public confidence. The H1N1 pandemic has highlighted challenges of using evidence during a public health emergency and the importance of understanding this process to identify barriers and modifiable influences. The purpose of this study is to gain an in-depth understanding of the factors that affected the use of evidence for public health decisions in Canada during the H1N1 pandemic. Specifically to: identify the range of evidence used, identify barriers that limited the use of evidence for decision-making, and identify factors that influenced how evidence was used and/or interpreted. Policies to be studied include: use of adjuvant vaccine, pandemic vaccine priority groups and sequencing, school closures, and personal protective equipment. Data will be collected though policy document analysis and through key informant interviews with public health decision-makers at federal, provincial and regional levels. This study will look in depth at the question of how we did real-time policy with real-time science.  As a result, the findings will provide the basis for more effective and transparent use of evidence in addition to identifying barriers in the public health system. This will be a contribution for public health stakeholders to improve policymaking, particularly during a pandemic or other emergency setting.

In public health, data platforms are being left behind by technological advances,  and are difficult to access, technically limited and unable to support innovation. Methods now exist that protect privacy and make health information available and accessible in cloud-based, high-performance computing platforms that would also enable us to innovate in analytic methods. We propose to hold a workshop in order to achieve the following objectives:
1.Develop strong links between researchers working in computer science and public health, who are interested in the application of artificial intelligence tools such as machine learning and deep learning to large collections of data on infectious diseases.
2.Explore how to increase the speed with which we access data, improve the quality of data and create environments in which new tools can be applied to huge amounts of data very quickly.
3.Start to develop some specific potential project proposals in small inter-disciplinary groups in order to establish research teams to develop funding proposals.
4.Build connections between public health researchers and potential industry partners.
We expect the meeting to advance existing partnerships between up to 50 public health researchers, computer science and industry participants to solidify several joint funding proposals. Participants will be invited to represent diverse perspectives and ensure a balanced mix of expertise in the six project proposal teams. In addition to a scoping review about current studies combining public health and AI, we will present the results of workshop in written form and participate in an Institute for Policy and Public Health in the Fall of 2018."
Maximizing the impact of immunization programs in Canada: bridging the gap between research and policy,"['Crowcroft, Natasha S']","['Bolotin, Shelly', 'De Wals, Philippe', 'Deeks, Shelley L', 'Henry, Bonnie J', 'Ogilvie, Gina S', 'Wilson, Kumanan']","['Concept Mapping', 'Evidenced-Based Immunization Policy', 'Implementation Science', 'Knowledge Synthesis']",10000.0,353007,"Canadians are not benefiting as much they could be from immunization. Despite spending millions of dollars on immunization, we are ranked 28/29 amongst developed world countries. Immunization is the most cost-effective and impactful medical intervention available for keeping people healthy, so the fact that the immunization system is not reaching enough people is a huge missed opportunity to promote health. 

It is not immediately clear why we are in this situation. Canada has well-respected national processes for finding the evidence on vaccines and making recommendations for how best to use them, supportive professionals and governments at national and local levels, public funding for vaccines and healthcare, and a generally receptive public. And yet there are gaps in the way both our constantly evolving knowledge and carefully developed recommendations on vaccines are translated into action to benefit Canadians.

For new research on the benefits of vaccines to have greater and quicker impact on the way immunization programs are implemented, we need to find ways to increase its impact. Scientific evidence needs to be able to quickly reach from national experts to local governments that are making policy and funding decisions and into the hands of immunizers, and in a way that is useful to everyone. The question is how best to achieve a greater impact and influence of science. 

We propose to bring together people who represent the key organizations and professions to explore the hypothesis that science may have more impact if those more closely involved with making decisions at local level are more connected with researchers in a two-way process that influences how research influences recommendations and how policy questions shape research. The workshop will increase understanding of the different needs of researchers and policy makers, explore how to connect groups together, and develop proposals to take forward in future research."

Aims: 
1.To learn about how community and cultural experiences have changed since becoming a wheelchair or walker (with wheels) user. 
2.To explore what makes it easier or harder for First Nation seniors
 to participate in their communities and how they view the impact of participation on their health and the health of their communities.
3.To make a best practice guide using the outcomes from the study, so they can use it to increase participation and improve health.
Approach/Methodology: The first and second aim of the project will be accomplished by: conducting semi-structured interviews with participants from Six Nation's and Akwesasne. The interviews will last approximately 60 minutes each. The third aim will be accomplished by putting together a document on best practices for each community. 
•An Interdisciplinary approach will be used in order to fully address this research question because it is a co-production of knowledge from diverse disciplines such as: professors in nursing; members of Health Canada; Chief and Council Members; Elders and other Indigenous researchers from all over Canada.

First Nation Elders who use wheeled mobility: an exploration of culture and health,"['Croxall, Lindsay C']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1307.0,368205,"Purpose. The purpose of this study was to gain an understanding of how First Nation seniors who rely on wheelchairs and walkers with wheels experience participation in culturally meaningful activities in their communities. 

Method. A qualitative approach and purposive sampling were used to recruit participants who use wheelchairs and walkers with wheels and live in First Nations communities. Data were collected using a demographic form and a semi-structured interview.

Results. Elders have an important role in the health of their communities which involves the transmission of culture to younger generations. The participants said that teaching youth the culture that they've been disconnected from gives them an identity and gives them back the self-respect that has been taken from them.  Although participants related positively to their wheelchairs and/or walkers with wheels they participate less or not at all since becoming a wheeled mobility user. The decrease in participation is due to barriers such as: accessing the outdoors; negotiating exterior paths of travel; weather; transportation of self and device; accessibility at the events; stigma and burden. 

Conclusion. The findings show that policy changes are required regarding the allocation of funding to ensure that First Nation seniors on reserve can safely access the outdoors (ramps from their homes), safe access to sidewalks, appropriate transportation , accessibility at the events (such as doors that are wide enough and accessible bathrooms), and education to reduce stigma and feelings of burden.  Transportation was the largest barrier to cultural participation."

Different people have different views about how much of this responsibility should be taken on by governments and other organized institutions versus how much of this responsibility should be shouldered by individuals.

In this Café, we will discuss research that has been done on answering the question: How do different cultural ideals about the responsibilities that organized groups (such as institutions and governments) have versus the responsibilities that individuals have, affect how healthy people end up being and how healthy the environment that supports them ends up being?   This question is important because it affects things like how much money governments should spend supporting our health and whether there are more cost-effective ways to promote health instead.  Knowing the answer to this question helps us to figure out how best to shape the health and environmental policy of groups like governments.   We will focus our discussion specifically on how these policies and commitments affects the health and health-environments of Northern communities.

We are also going to discuss research that has been done on answering the question: How do different approaches and attitudes to dividing up responsibility for health between health care workers (such as physicians) and patients, actually end up affecting health outcomes?  As we will see, the approach to dividing up responsibility has a particularly big effect when it comes to the health of those people who have been in the past been more disempowered in the doctor-patient relationship.  Thus, answering this question can help us figure out how to further improve the health of members of Indigenous communities, women, and children."

"Will that work here? Advancing evidence-informed decision-making in work disability prevention policy, practice and research efforts.","['Cullen, Kimberley L']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,400218,"Physical and mental health conditions dominate as the leading causes of work disability worldwide. Over the last decade, systematic reviews have synthesized the best research evidence across more than 150 studies to learn what we can do to support return-to-work (RTW), improve recovery and reduce productivity losses.

Despite this evidence, workplaces face challenges in implementing these strategies. Canadian workplaces face many challenges, including: distinct industry sectors, a high prevalence of remote and small workplaces, and an aging and increasingly precariously-employed workforce. Many provinces also have high rates of disability and unemployment and declining labour forces. Successful RTW is critical to minimizing unemployment while maximizing the capacities of the dwindling labour force across these jurisdictions.

Using an illustrative example on supporting workers with physical and mental health conditions in RTW, this project outlines a novel synthesis approach that links evidence to practice. Applying a model for evidence-informed decision support, we draw on the best research evidence and integrate it with contextual evidence from practitioner expertise and stakeholder experiences to answer the questions: what works?, will it work here? and, can we implement it in practice?

Findings from three projects will document our experience applying this decision support model to help workers with physical and mental health conditions in RTW. Results highlight the effectiveness of this model in bridging research-to-practice knowledge gaps.

This synthesis approach demonstrates a practical way to enhance the use of current knowledge tailored to the context of specific industries and workplaces. The model's primary strength lies in the use of three sources of evidence: research findings, practitioner expertise and stakeholder experience. The full integration of these sources of evidence enhances the opportunity for optimal work disability prevention efforts."

However, the majority of research, and the limited development of evidence-based clinical or community programs in exercise and cancer, has been conducted almost exclusively in urban academic and clinical settings. Very limited implementation in ""hard to reach"" CS, such as those in rural or non-urban environments, has occurred. There are unique features of the rural environment that are significant barriers to cancer care in general, and to supportive cancer care resources in particular, such as: geographic diversity, isolation, limited access/travel distances to resources and facilities, and lack of trained personnel to implement survivorship services,. Rural CS (RCS), or those living in non-urban settings (defined as <100,000 in population), report higher cancer burden from diagnosis through treatment and into survivorship (i.e., greater symptom burden). This burden is associated with inequitable access to supportive cancer care resources, including exercise programs, resulting in RCS experiencing more negative effects after treatment than their urban counterparts and being overall less healthy.

Objectives: To disseminate, implement, and assess the effectiveness of our Exercise Oncology Survivorship (EOS) partnership model to increase the reach and delivery of exercise programs to RCS. Reaching more RCS with an exercise program will enhance cancer survivorship, providing fitness, health, and psychosocial benefits.

Significance: Given our previous implementation success, we will extend the reach of our EOS partnership model across rural Canada and change the exercise levels of RCS. Our impact will include a sustainable environment to support exercise as a supportive cancer care for RCS towards greater quality of life."

Involvement as a bully or victim is associated with poor school attendance, underachievement, dropout, health complaints, sleep difficulties, anxiety, depression, and suicide.  The difficulties associated with bullying persist into adulthood as poorer health and mental health outcomes.
Unfortunately, reviews of prevention trials suggest that programs designed to prevent or reduce bullying often yield very modest benefits. Our studies suggest that certain features of bullying prevention programs may limit their effectiveness by eliciting an unintended negative response, reactance.  Reactance has been reported when prevention programs are perceived as an effort to change attitudes, restrict access to important activities, or limit decision control.  Importantly, our studies suggest some features of bullying prevention programs may also reduce reactance.  We have also found evidence that some features of these programs may elicit reactance among educators, and a subsequent reduction in support for the implementation of these programs. 
  We propose to conduct focus groups with 60 students and 60 educators to explore the features of bullying prevention programs that elicit reactance, ways reactance is expressed, how reactance undermines outcome, and features that reduce reactance.  Next, we will use survey methods from marketing research to model the influence of different features of bullying prevention programs on reactance by 1200 educators and 2000 students in grades 5, 6, 7, and 8, a period when bullying increases, students become more independent, and there is a greater likelihood of reactance.  We will identify features of bullying prevention programs that are most likely to increase or decrease reactance, identify the demographic and behavioral predictors of reactance, and simulate a program that minimizes reactance."

While the percentage of adult smokers decreased from 35% to 19% over the twenty years from 1985 to 2005, little further decline occurred in the years following. Large scale strategies are needed to further reduce the number of smokers in Canada.

One strategy generating interest is mass distribution of Nicotine Replacement Therapy to smokers. Research on Nicotine Replacement Therapy generated promising results, showing that it successfully helps many smokers quit smoking. However, no research study adequately addresses how effective mass distributions of Nicotine Replacement Therapy are in reducing smoking rates. 

Telephone numbers will be randomly selected from across Canada in order to recruit adult smokers interested in completing a smoking survey and willing to be interviewed again in 8 weeks and 6 months time. Study participants will be asked about their smoking history and a hypothetical question: would they be interested in receiving the Nicotine Patch if this were to be provided to them free of charge? Participants expressing interest will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group will be offered the opportunity to actually receive a program of 5 weeks of the Nicotine Patch for free right away and the other group will not be offered the free Nicotine Patches. 

The proportions of smokers in the two groups who quit smoking by the 6-month interview will be compared. Evidence that reduction in the number of smokers can be attributed to large scale distribution of free Nicotine Replacement Therapy will provide a strong argument that more initiatives of this type should be undertaken in Canada to further reduce the number of preventable deaths."

Most people with alcohol problems will never seek treatment. There is a need to develop alternate ways to help problem drinkers outside of formal treatment settings.

One promising strategy is Internet-based interventions for problem drinkers. Our first randomized controlled trial found that we could reduce alcohol consumption by about six drinks per week at a six-month follow-up using a minimal, personalized feedback Internet-based intervention. Our second randomized trial demonstrated that an extended Internet-based intervention that contained a range of cognitive-behavioural and relapse prevention tools could produce greater reductions in problem drinking compared to that provided by the same minimal intervention at a six-month follow-up. Building upon this research, the current project will assess whether this extended Internet-based intervention can have a sustained impact on problem drinking. Specifically, the major objective of this project is to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing the impact of an extended Internet-based self-help intervention for problem drinkers to a minimal Internet-based intervention in the general population of problem drinkers over a two year period. 

Problem drinking participants will be recruited through media advertisements across Canada and will be randomly assigned to the minimal or extended Internet-based interventions.  Six-month, twelve-month and two-year drinking outcomes will be compared between experimental conditions. It is predicted that participants receiving the extended Internet intervention will display sustained improved drinking outcomes compared to participants in the minimal Internet intervention condition.

Our previous research indicated that the impact of the mailed NRT intervention on increasing quit rates in rural areas may be substantial. The current research project seeks to confirm this finding and to understand the social determinants of health driving these anticipated large effects. This information is essential in order to target limited health resources to regions that are most in need, and who are likely to experience the greatest benefit.

Telephone numbers will be randomly selected from across rural regions of Canada in order to recruit adult smokers interested in completing a smoking survey and willing to be interviewed again in 6 months. The survey will ask participants about their smoking history, demographic characteristics, and a hypothetical question: would they be interested in receiving the nicotine patch if this were provided to them free of charge? Half of the smokers interested in receiving nicotine patches will be selected by chance and offered the NRT package. The other half of smokers will not be offered the nicotine patches until after the 6-month follow-up interview. In addition, the municipality where each participant lives will be identified and participant data will be linked to relevant municipal characteristics (e.g., smoking rates, availability of health services). Characteristics of the participants and the municipalities in which they live will be used to explain why the nicotine patch intervention has a larger impact in some rural regions compared to others. Finally, comparisons will be made with our existing urban study sample in order to shed further light on why the impact of the NRT intervention may be so large in rural settings."

The assessment of socioeconomic inequalities in health is crucial for identifying vulnerable populations that could benefit from targeted interventions. While measuring these inequalities is important, it is equally critical to uncover the underlying factors responsible for these inequalities to enable effective interventions. In Canada, Indigenous populations frequently encounter significant inequalities both within their communities and when compared to the rest of the country. These inequalities can include financial obstacles, restricted access to resources, as well as social barriers. Although some studies have examined health inequalities experienced by Indigenous peoples in Canada there is a notable research gap concerning socioeconomic inequalities in the prevalence of chronic diseases among these populations in the country, including conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and obesity. Thus, this study aims to bridge this research gap by tracking trends and identifying the factors that contribute to socioeconomic inequalities in the prevalence of chronic diseases among Indigenous communities in Canada. Chronic diseases have long-lasting impacts on individuals and are often associated with other adverse outcomes such as heart disease, compromised immunity, and diminished mental health. By identifying and proposing strategies to mitigate the factors that place individuals of different socioeconomic statuses at greater risk of these chronic diseases, we can strive to reduce socioeconomic inequalities in health, particularly among Indigenous communities across Canada."

There appears to be a direct link between TBI and violence, which itself is a major issue for Canadians.  The goal of the research team is to undertake a coordinated and comprehensive program of research based on the hypothesis that vulnerable populations carry the mutual burden of violence and brain injury for which there are shared, modifiable risk factors. The team will initiate research in five areas:identifying and characterizing high risk populations vulnerable to violence and TBI; studying the relationship between alcohol, cannabis, violence and TBI; examining TBI and violence in the homeless; examining TBI in sport; and examining cultural factors that propagate the problem.  As well, the research team will undertake program and product evaluations and undertake knowledge translation activities designed to transform information into action."
"Effects of Recreational Cannabis Legalization on Polysubstance Use, Mental Health, and Injury in Canada: The RCL IMPACT Study","['Cusimano, Michael D']","['Bhalerao, shree', 'Fairgrieve, Christopher D', 'Isaranuwatchai, Wanrudee', 'Lurie, Erin', 'Mann, Robert E', 'Orkin, Aaron M', 'Saarela, Olli S', 'Selby, Peter L', 'Vaz, Eric']","['Addiction', 'Cannabis', 'Injury', 'Longitudinal Study', 'Mental Health Outcomes', 'Policy', 'Polysubstance Use', 'Population Health', 'Public Health', 'Trauma']",650252.0,453374,"Opioid overdoses, polysubstance misuse, mental health disorders, and trauma place a significant health and economic burden on Canadians. While recreational cannabis legalization (RCL) has been used in some U.S.A states to control the opioid epidemic and for potential positive health benefits, two Canadian studies have already reported an increase in rates of emergency department (ED) visits for cannabis poisoning since RCL. Compared to other ED patients, those with cannabis poisoning have a higher frequency of mental health diagnoses, specifically mood and anxiety disorders. Most patients in the ED with cannabis poisoning have also used at least one other substance, primarily alcohol. Acute cannabis use is known to change perceptions and behaviour, and has been found to increase the risk of injury, including traffic deaths and falls, which is the most common cause of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in older adults. Although some regions in the U.S.A have found that rates of traffic deaths and cannabis poisonings increased after RCL, in Canada and elsewhere there is a lack of strong evidence on RCL's impact on other health outcomes and their associated costs. In this study, we will assess whether monthly rates of hospitalizations, ED visits, and deaths for substance use (including cannabis, alcohol, and/or opioids), mental health outcomes, and injuries (including TBI) have changed overall and among different groups/locations since RCL in Canada. We will also determine the effect of RCL on healthcare service utilization costs for all health outcomes. This research is important for guiding policy, education, and prevention strategies that support and improve the health and well-being of all Canadians."
