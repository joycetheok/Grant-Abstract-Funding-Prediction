The Epidemiology of Resilience Following Child Maltreatment Exposure: An Examination of Protective Factors Across the Lifespan,"['Afifi, Tracie O']",['N/A'],"['Child Maltreatment', 'Epidemiology', 'Gender', 'Intervention', 'Lifespan Approach', 'Mental Health Promotion', 'Population Health', 'Protective Factors', 'Resilience', 'Risk Factors']",300000.0,268801,"To date, child maltreatment research has focused mainly on risk factors and poor outcomes with fewer studies examining resilience following child maltreatment and protective factors associated with mental health (e.g., absence of mental
disorders and high quality of life). Resilience is generally described as the ability to maintain or regain mental health after adverse exposure. A protective factor is an indicator that is associated with an increased likelihood of a positive outcome. A review of the literature indicated that supportive relationships show a consistent association with healthy outcomes. What is still largely unknown is the prevalence of mental health in the general population following child maltreatment exposure in comparison to non-maltreated individuals. What other protective factors are associated with mental health and how can
resilience be enhanced? Fostering resilience after child maltreatment has the potential to improve mental health for individuals and populations. The current proposal is unique because it will lead to new knowledge that will guide the development of intervention strategies to promote protective factors in facilitating resilience among individuals with a history of child maltreatment exposure across the lifespan-from adolescence to later adulthood. An epidemiological perspective will be applied to understand the prevalence of child maltreatment and mental health, the relationship between protective factors
and mental health cross-sectionally and over a 3-year period. Noted strengths of this research include accessing large nationally representative Canadian and US data, examining sex and gender differences, using a lifespan approach, accessing longitudinal data, using high quality measures of child maltreatment and mental health, and inclusion of several protective factors in one study."
Pulling Together for Health: Food Security in First Nations Communities,"['Batal, Malek', 'Willows, Noreen D']","['David, William', 'Derejko, Katie-Sue', 'Isaac-Mann, Sonia T', 'Johnson, Suzanne J', 'Sheedy, Amanda', 'Chan, Laurie H', 'Delormier, Treena', 'Moubarac, Jean-Claude', 'Thom, Brian']","['Case Studies', 'Community Food Security Programs', 'Database Analyses', 'Diet Quality', 'Evaluation', 'First Nations', 'Food Security', 'Indigenous Peoples', 'Obesity', 'Sustainable Food Systems']",100000.0,328706,"Food security exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for a healthy and active life. Consistently, surveys have indicated that First Nations (FN) households struggle to feed their families based on reports of an elevated prevalence of income-related household food insecurity (HFI). Data from the ongoing First Nations, Food Nutrition and Environment Study (FNFNES) indicate that, on average, 30% of on-reserve households are food insecure. Factors which contribute to HFI are high-levels of poverty and unemployment, and the high cost, limited availability and poor quality of store bought market food. FN HFI is a serious public health issue given that food insecurity is intertwined with poor nutrition, health and well-being. A unique food security consideration for FN is Traditional Food Access (TFA) related to the harvesting, sharing, preparation and consumption of traditional food (TF) (i.e., crops and wild-harvested plants, game, fish, birds and marine mammals). The work of this investigative team shows that TF are nutritionally superior to many domesticated or processed foods and improve diet quality and nutrient intake. Clearly, TF and TF practices are central to FN culture, health and survival. The proposed collaborative, multi-method research will provide a better understanding of the health implications of FN HFI, the variability in HFI between communities and the relationship between HFI and health outcomes. It will identify the types of market food that, when combined within a traditional food-based diet, will improve food security without diminishing diet quality or contributing to the rise of obesity. The research will describe commonalities of successful FN food security programs and approaches that will permit theorizing about the development of effective programs and governance frameworks."
Health and housing: Determinants of food security among social housing residents in B.C.,"['Beveridge, Rachelle']",['N/A'],"['Determinants Of Health', 'Food Security', 'Health Equity', 'Housing']",105000.0,229648,"Food insecurity occurs when people or families lack affordable, accessible, and nutritious food.  This may occur for many reasons, including lack of money to purchase quality food, and adverse physical or mental health problems which prevent access to food.  People who live in social housing often experience food insecurity, even though there are some food security programs in place to prevent this.  Food insecurity can have serious health consequences: it has been linked to diabetes and obesity, and it can worsen other physical and mental health issues.  However, food insecurity can also be caused by health problems.  This research project investigates how the health problems of social housing residents affect their ability to access nutritious food, and whether their neighbourhood and housing situation affects this relationship.  For example, the availability of a community kitchen and storage facilities, or the proximity of a good grocery store or food bank might affect whether people are able to eat well, especially if they are already ill and having trouble accessing food.  This study will identify what neighbourhood and housing environments contribute to the reduction of  food insecurity, and how food and housing programs can further support people living in social housing to eat healthily."
First Nations Feasibility Study on Biobanking and Genomic Research,"['First Nations Information Governance Centre, .', 'Adams, Evan L', 'Armieri, Albert', 'Bombay, Amy', 'Caron, Nadine R', 'Dewar, Jonathan', 'Hardy, Billie Jo', 'Hopkins, Carol A', 'McQuaid, Robyn J', 'Nahwegahbow, Amy J', 'Perron, Magnolia', 'Santos, Maria T', 'Walker, Jennifer', 'Wilson, Peigi']",['N/A'],"['Biobanking', 'Bioethics', 'Biological Health Research', 'Community-Based Participatory Research', 'Genomic Research', 'Indigenous Data Sovereignty', 'Indigenous Knowledge', 'Indigenous Research Methods', 'Information Governance']",450000.0,465979,"First Nations in Canada are underrepresented in biobanks and genomic research. The lack of participation in biobanks and genetic research can be attributed to a long-standing history of unethical biological sampling in Indigenous communities. First Nations have raised concerns regarding failures to obtain appropriate consent, lack of benefits to the communities, misuse of blood and tissue samples, and the inappropriate storage and ownership of biological samples. 

First Nations are missing out on the potential benefits, such as early detection and diagnosis, that can result from this type of research. This is particularly concerning given that First Nations continue to be disproportionately affected by diseases and illnesses. While biobanks and genomic research may be beneficial to First Nations, there is a need to identify clear guidelines and protocols that are culturally relevant and can be easily adapted by First Nations to lead and engage in biobanking in accordance with their interests and rights of data sovereignty. 

The First Nations Information Governance Centre (FNIGC) in collaboration with its regional partners will strengthen First Nations in their capacity to engage in genomic research and biobanking activities through a series of knowledge-sharing and regionally-driven engagement sessions. Guided by a First Nations Advisory Circle, this three-year project will increase the understanding of the relevance and priority of biobanking and genomic research for First Nations communities and inform the development of a First Nations-led governance and ethical framework. Through this project, FNIGC will develop tools and information First Nations need to govern and control biobanking activities and genomic research in their communities."
Exploring police officers' susceptibility to posttraumatic stress after exposure to fictional and real-world trauma,"['Horswill, Samantha']",['N/A'],"['Fictional Traumatic Media', 'Police Populations', 'Posttraumatic Stress Disorder', 'Resilience Variables', 'Risk Variables']",52500.0,277269,"Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious mental disorder resulting in a constellation of mental, physical, social, and interpersonal symptoms. Police officers are exposed to higher rates of traumatic and work environment stressors relative to civilians, with 13 to 32% of officers reporting PTSD symptoms at any time. Identifying risk (e.g., anxiety sensitivity, intolerance of uncertainty, personality) and resilience (e.g., hope, optimism, perceived social support) variables associated with the development of PTSD in policing populations is clinically and economically advantageous for individual officers, their families, police agencies, and taxpayers. The proposed study will investigate the risk and resilience profile of 60 new Saskatchewan Police College (SkPC) recruits at baseline, following exposure to commercially available horror movie, and following one year of active duty. Each questionnaire battery will be supplemented by a structured clinical interview administered by qualified researcher to assess for psychiatric disorders (e.g., PTSD). Hierarchical linear modelling will be performed after data collection from each re-administration is completed, to assess relationships between the independent variables (i.e., risk and resilience) and the dependent variables (i.e., PTSD symptoms). Key outcomes include conceptualization of the risk and resilience profile which leads police officers to be more susceptible to PTSD following trauma exposure, which has immediate practical implications for assessment, treatment, and potentially even intervention for at risk police officers. Findings from the proposed study would serve as a clear stepping stone for informing future research, policy, and program development for not only municipal police officers but also federal police and military forces."
Cross-Sectoral Collaboration to Improve Outcomes for Children/Youth in Vulnerable Contexts,"['Khayatzadeh-Mahani, Akram', 'Davies, Lorilee']","['Diener, Tania', 'Dusterbeck, Tammy', 'LeBlond, Jocelyn', 'McKillop, Ian', 'Dutton, Daniel J', 'Jeffery, Bonnie L', 'Mcintosh, Thomas A', 'Mou, Haizhen', 'Muhajarine, Nazeem', 'Reid, Nathalie S', 'Zwicker, Jennifer D']","['Children And Youth In Vulnerable Contexts', 'Children Wellbeing', 'Coordinated Service Delivery', 'Cross-Sectoral Collaboration', 'Healthy Development Of Children', 'Improving Outcomes For Children', 'Integrated Care', 'Interagency Collaboration', 'Population Health Outcomes', 'Service Coordination']",150000.0,475158,"Despite efforts of Canadian governments to address problems created by service fragmentation, many children and youth with complex needs continue to fall through the cracks in the siloed systems of care. Children with mental health issues are significantly affected by service fragmentation as they are typically dependent on a variety of support service systems. These children experience the poorest outcomes in academic performance and graduation rates, dependence on social assistance, and justice system involvement. Cross-sectoral collaboration has been advocated as a tool to overcome existing silos through providing coordinated support services. TRiP (The Regina intersectoral Partnership) is a collaboration across 6 human service organizations (Saskatchewan Health Authority, Regina Public School Division, Regina Catholic School Division, Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Social Services, and Regina Police Service) in Regina delivering coordinated support services to children and youth in vulnerable contexts. TRiP has received approximately 1000 referrals since inception in 2010 of which 94% have improved school attendance. Using TRiP as a case study, this research aims to investigate the formation and patterns of collaboration, factors influencing collaboration and service coordination across sectors, and processes and structures involved in building and maintaining a strong cross-sectoral collaboration. We will also examine TRiP's governance, organization, delivery of coordinated services across sectors, funding structure, and accountability mechanisms. Findings will have policy implications for improving coordinated service delivery across health and other human service organizations and ultimately improved health outcomes among children and youth. Findings can guide the implementation of context-driven strategies to sustain and maximize the impact of collaborative efforts across sectors."
Body composition and breast cancer related biomarkers,"['Knight, Julia A']","['Cheung, Angela M']","['Adiponectin', 'Body Composition', 'Dual X-Ray Absorptiometry', 'Estradiol', 'Insulin', 'Mammographic Density', 'Postmenopausal Women', 'Testosterone']",296472.0,207757,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women.  Most breast cancer occurs in the postmenopausal years.  Women with larger body size have a higher risk of developing breast cancer after menopause, but the reasons why involve many different factors.  There are several factors related both to body size and to breast cancer that likely explain some of this increased risk.  These factors include hormones related to reproduction such as estrogen and also those related to blood sugar levels such as insulin.  Body fat has different effects depending on where it is located such as around the waist or in the upper or lower body.  We plan to test whether a common method of assessing bone density, dual x-ray absorptiometry, which can also detect amounts of body fat in different parts of the body, can be used to tell us more about the specific factors putting individual women at risk.  Postmenopausal women being screened in the Ontario Breast Screening Program who are not taking hormones will be invited to participate in the study.  We will look for relationships between amounts of fat and non-fat tissue in different areas of the body and factors related to both body size and breast cancer such as estrogen, testosterone, insulin, and adiponectin and also breast tissue patterns seen on mammograms.  Ultimately we hope to better determine what puts an individual woman at risk so that a more individual plan for prevention can be developed.  That is, more detailed information about an individual woman's body composition may help us determine the specific factors putting her at risk of getting breast cancer and allow us to develop a specific strategy to reduce her risk."
"Sex, gender and equity in prescription drug access, appropriateness, and affordability","['Morgan, Steven G']","['Law, Michael R', 'Mintzes, Barbara J', 'Raymond, Colette B', 'Wong, Sabrina T']","['Access', 'Affordability', 'Appropriateness', 'Equity', 'Gender', 'Prescription Drugs', 'Sex']",687978.0,238440,"The proposed research will generate important evidence from previously uncorrelated data on how biological and social dimensions of sex and gender influence equity in prescription drug access, appropriateness, and affordability. The research team will employ advanced statistical methods to conduct five interrelated projects that draw on available population-based data: market research data, linked administrative health care data, and national surveys. They will produce an edition of the Canadian Rx Atlas that will focus on sex- and gender-related aspects of medicine use across Canada. They will study how patterns of medicine use are affected by an individual's sex, age, income, ethnicity, and place of residence. They will measure factors contributing to exposure to and outcomes from potentially risky medicine use during pregnancy. They will also quantify how different proposals for a national pharmacare program will affect women and men differently and how these differences change depending on an individual's age, income, and household composition."
SickKids Café Scientifique: 2012 Program,"['Nicholson, Janice']",['N/A'],"['Air Pollution', 'Asthma', 'Cafe Scientifique', 'Child Health', 'Chronic Disease', 'Diabetes', 'Environment', 'Spinal Cord', 'Stem Cells', 'Translational Research']",3000.0,263505,"The objective:
The Research Institute at The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) is seeking funds from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Café Scientifique funding program for 2012/13. 

The event:
SickKids plans to host a series of two Café scientifiques in the 2012/13 season. The first one would occur on a weekday evening in Fall 2012. A subsequent event would be planned for Spring 2013. 

These events will be coordinated by our Communications & Public Affairs events management team. They have successfully run five CIHR-funded Café Scientifiques.

The intended venue for the events is tentatively planned for the Hard Rock Café in Toronto. This venue is centrally located (right off Dundas Square) and is within a block of both a subway stop and a parking garage. We have held two successful events in this location in the past. The pub is equipped with a variety of seating areas and can accommodate small intimate events right up to events with well over 100 people. The venue is wheelchair accessible. Costs associated with this venue are negotiable and are based on size of event and level of sales.

The themes:
- Are Stem Cell the Basis for Immortality?
- Gasping for Answers: Understanding the role air quality & the environment play on asthma and other chronic conditions"
Building Healthy and Resilient Cities: Identifying and Creating Enablers for Effective Governance Processes,"['Therrien, Marie-Christine', 'Gauvin, Lise']","['Raynault, Marie-France', 'Smits, Pernelle']","['Governance', 'Institutional Enablers', 'Intervention Research', 'Resilience', 'Social Inequalities', 'Urban Health']",10000.0,378425,"City governments are investing to create places where people can work, live, and play in a healthy way according to their life goals. Even though city governments aim to improve citizen well-being, they are also faced with stresses and shocks such as extreme weather events, air pollution, and aging populations which create challenges to building healthy cities. Improving the city's resilience or its capacity to adapt to stresses has been identified as a strategy for creating and maintaining healthy cities. Unfortunately, there is only limited knowledge about the best type of city governance to achieve these goals. We propose to develop the blueprint for large-scale investigation about how to increase resilience through city actions in 5 Canadian cities and 5 European cities.  We propose to conduct a 2-day workshop during which researchers and knowledge-users involved in two major Canadian initiatives will be gathered together to design the large-scale investigation. The first initiative is called The LivingLab on Urban Resilience Governance and is a collaborative space that brings together Canadian city managers, private organizations, citizens, and university researchers. The LivingLab is an incubator for developing new approaches for increasing resilience and is funded by the Fonds de recherche du Québec. The second initiative is called MUSE (Multisectoral Urban Systems for health and Equity in Canadian Cities) and is a 5-year research program funded by the CIHR. The program of research is aimed at understanding how partnerships can help build healthy cities to improve physical activity, healthy eating, and safe/affordable housing. Specific topics to be addressed during the workshop include identifying research questions, choosing the design, developing measures, describing data analysis approaches, and developing the best ways to share the new knowledge gained through the projects."
Evaluating and Understanding the Impact of Tobacco Control Policies of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control in a Rapidly Changing Global Tobacco Market: The International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project,"['Fong, Geoffrey T']","['Bianco, Eduardo', 'Borland, Ron', 'Boudreau, Christian', 'Chaloupka, Frank', 'Cummings, K.

The 2003 WHO treaty, the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) obligates 180 countries (90% of the world's population) to implement policies to reduce global tobacco use. If fully implemented, the FCTC would be the greatest disease prevention initiative in history. But FCTC implementation has been slow, weakened by tobacco industry influence. The International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation (ITC) Project is a global research program addressing the urgent need for strong evidence about FCTC policy impact by (1) evaluating FCTC policies, (2) understanding determinants of tobacco use vs. quitting, (3) identifying differences in global FCTC policy impact. The ITC research team of >100 tobacco control experts has conducted cutting edge evaluation studies of FCTC policies in 22 countries, home to >70% of the world's tobacco users. ITC has consistently reported evidence used globally to strengthen tobacco policies that improve population health (www.itcproject.org). Since its start 13 years ago, ITC data have been used to strengthen tobacco control policies in many countries, including Canada. We propose to continue this global project by: 1) continuing our rigorous evaluation of FCTC policies, focusing on regions where the tobacco industry is increasing its attention (e.g., Asia, Africa, Middle East); 2) expand ITC to evaluate new leading-edge policies (e.g., plain packaging, additive bans), 3) conduct the first-ever international cohort study of e-cigarettes to answer critical questions about their impact on tobacco use; and 4) strengthen dissemination efforts to bring our evidence to governments to support stronger tobacco control globally. ITC has advanced science, improved population health initiatives, and built strong collaborations with governments and health communities globally. We will strengthen our efforts to use science to combat the world's leading preventable cause of death and disease."
Impacts of model heterogeneity on simulated HIV epidemics in Southern Africa,"['Knight, Jesse']",['N/A'],"['Epidemic', 'Female Sex Workers', 'Hiv', 'Interventions', 'Key Populations', 'Mathematical Modelling', 'Men Who Have Sex With Men', 'Sexually Transmitted Diseases', 'Simulation', 'Southern Africa']",105000.0,404078,"BACKGROUND: Every year, over half a million people become infected with HIV in Southern Africa, with key populations like female sex workers (FSW) and men who have sex with men (MSM) bearing the heaviest burden. Mathematical modelling of epidemics plays an important role in policy response, from helping to understand dynamics of epidemics, to finding optimal intervention strategies (e.g. increase condom use or increase treatment). Such models are often complex, and need to be solved using code. One important question is just how complex they need to be, since recent work has shown that our interpretation of the results can be different depending on how complex the model is - for example, which intervention turns out to be ""optimal"". Is it important to include key populations like FSW and MSM in the model? What about differences among FSW and among MSM? What about other characteristics like age, race, and geography?

OBJECTIVES: In this project, we hope to clarify which population characteristics it is important to include in models of HIV transmission, and in which contexts. Since inclusion of these characteristics requires data about the population, we will also clarify exactly which pieces of data are needed to build a good model. Finally, when such data are unavailable, as they sometimes are, models may be limited in their ability to simulate an epidemic accurately; therefore, we will also describe potential biases in the simulated epidemics when certain data are not included, and what to do about them.

METHODS: First, we will create a ""gold-standard"" model, and use detailed data from Southern African countries to ensure it simulates historical epidemic features accurately. Next, we will systematically remove modelled characteristics (like age), or change how they are represented, one-at-a-time, and then in combination, to see how the simulated epidemic changes. We will also compare the impact of these changes on which intervention is predicted to be optimal."
An Integrated Real-time Modeling and Surveillance Decision-support Framework to Inform Public Health Emergency Preparedness,"['Pourbohloul, Babak', 'Henry, Bonnie J']","['Balshaw, Robert F', 'English, Krista', 'Mak, Sunny', 'Otterstatter, Michael C']",['Pandemic Preparedness'],100000.0,313958,"Globally, the threat of Emerging Infectious Diseases (EIDs) is on the rise. Significant time and resources have been invested in the development of pandemic preparedness plans, designed to prevent or mitigate the impact of an EID pandemic. With the emergence of SARS in 2003, and novel influenza in 2009, these plans were challenged to ensure public health and security, quickly and with little information about the new EIDs. These experiences demonstrated that despite the best efforts to prepare for such events, real-time management of EIDs is often marked by confusion and uncertainty. 
Following post-pandemic consultations with international experts in pandemic planning research and decision-making, we better understand how to improve our responses. We have compiled their recommendations to address the knowledge gaps in planning for pandemic outbreaks and public health emergencies. The most prominent recommendations include developing methods to combine emerging infectious disease surveillance data with dynamic demographic mathematical models to rapidly understand and control an EID. 
This will allow researchers to understand how quickly an EID spreads and generate real-time control options for policymakers. The mathematical model addresses the specific characteristics of the BC population to determine exactly what options would best stop the spread of disease in this province. In parallel, we will conduct a complementary project to understand how this research becomes the basis for new policy during an emergency situation. This will ensure the most efficient flow of research to policy makers for future public health emergencies.
With the relevant regional demographic and surveillance data, these advanced frameworks can be implemented in other regions, both nationally and internationally. By focusing on real-time pandemic management options, we will provide tools to control EIDs in an effective way, reducing both the health and economic burden of these diseases."
Sharing the Lay of the Land: Developing an APHA Leadership Intervention Initiative,"['Masching, Renee', 'Loppie, Charlotte J']","['Bilsborrow, Priscilla P', 'Nobis, Anthony J', 'Peltier, Doris J', 'Cain, Roy']","['Aboriginal People Living With Hiv/Aids', 'Community-Based Research', 'Gipa', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Leadership']",33000.0,209428,"Current reports confirm that HIV/AIDS continues to disproportionately impact Aboriginal peoples in Canada. Intervention research represents a promising approach through which this critical health disparity might be addressed. Peer education, mobilization and support have emerged as integral components of prevention efforts as well as campaigns aimed at improving the health of those living with HIV and AIDS. Over the past 13 years, the Canadian Aboriginal AIDS Network (CAAN) has evolved from the initial National Aboriginal People living with HIV/AIDS Network (NAPHAN) to a leader in research, prevention and health promotion activities for Aboriginal Peoples living with or affected by HIV/AIDS. Recently, the CAAN Aboriginal People living with HIV/AIDS (APHA) Caucus and APHA Advisory Committee prioritized the development of a long term, strategic Leadership Initiative that emphasizes peer education, mobilization and support. The notion of engaging APHAs as peer-leaders in the fight against HIV/AIDS amoung Aboriginal peoples was first proposed in 2007: it is now clear that resources are required to organize current knowledge and unite key stakeholders. Catalyst grant funds are sought to support the Principle Investigators, team members and APHA Leadership Development sub-committee members to meet with APHA stakeholders, community and academic researchers to strengthen partnerships relevant to this specific initiative and prepare a full application to undertake a community-based intervention research project. This will ultimately assist CAAN in developing the knowledge necessary to carry out our HIV/AIDS work by effectively engaging and supporting APHA Leadership."
