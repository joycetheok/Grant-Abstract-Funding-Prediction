"Embarking on a journey to explore the realities of pediatric solid organ transplantation for Indigenous patients, families and communities across Canada","['Anthony, Samantha J', 'Beaucage, Mary B']","['Dart, Allison B', 'Goldberg, Aviva M', 'Matsuda-Abedini, Mina', 'Urschel, Simon', 'Weiss, Matthew']","['Health Equity', 'Indigenous Health', 'Patient Engagement', 'Patient-Oriented Research', 'Pediatrics', 'Solid Organ Transplantation']",382499.0,453092,"In Canada, Indigenous peoples (including First Nations, Métis and Inuit) experience persistent health and social disparities and report higher rates of end-stage organ failure. The reasons for these disparities are complex and have been linked to Canada's history of colonialism and racism. Our ultimate objective is to improve access rates and health outcomes of solid organ transplantation among Indigenous children. This research will explore the following questions: 1) How can we foster meaningful engagement with Indigenous patients and families as equal partners in research? 2) What is known about access to and outcomes of transplantation among Indigenous children? 3) How do transplantation rates and outcomes compare between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children? 4) What are the experiences and perspectives of Indigenous patients, families and knowledge users? And 5) How can we collaborate with knowledge users to create culturally safe tools to improve health outcomes in pediatric solid organ transplantation? Our study design will include four phases: 1) A scoping review to describe the international knowledge about access, survival and health outcomes of transplantation among Indigenous children; 2) A retrospective cohort study to compare transplantation rates and outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children in Canada; 3) Semi-structured Interviews with Indigenous transplant patients and families, and knowledge users to identify barriers and facilitators to transplant access and care; and 4) A knowledge sharing workshop with community partners and knowledge users. This research will focus on building strong partnerships with Indigenous patients and families to share power and research decision-making. Guided by their experiences and knowledge, this research will co-create new knowledge about transplantation rates and outcomes to inform measurable goals and interventions to improve health equity within pediatric transplantation."
Exploring health vulnerabilities and community-grown adaptation to climate change,"['Apantaku, Glory O']",['N/A'],"['Climate Change And Health', 'Environmental Determinants Of Health', 'Mixed Methods Research']",105000.0,476159,"Canada is warming at a rate twice the global average, in northern Canada, it's three times the global average. Communities across Canada are already experiencing direct health impacts from extremes of weather like heat waves and wildfires. These impacts are unequally distributed. The most vulnerable people, people with chronic conditions or in rural and remote areas with limited access to emergency services, bear most of the impact. There is an urgent need to understand and support community-grown adaptation taking place in rural and remote communities in Canada, as there is limited research on local solutions. My core objectives are to understand individuals' and communities' experiences of climate events, how their perception of vulnerability or resilience informs autonomous adaptation at the household or community level, and the types of solutions they believe will promote population health in a rapidly changing climate. This research will use mixed methods, including interviews, focus groups, photovoice, and choice experiments. Community members and community leaders will be able to share their perspectives and experiences. Photovoice, an arts-based method will provide people room for participants to not just tell but show their lived experiences through pictures. Interview and focus group data will be analyzed thematically, photovoice data will be analyzed in collaboration with participants through a meaning-making exercise. Choice experiments will be used to explore the preferences of people on the best ways to promote population health in a changing climate, data will be analyzed using conditional logit models in STATA. This work will highlight areas where policymakers in health authorities and ministries of health can provide funding and support or scale up community-grown adaptation efforts. It will also provide insight into public preferences for interventions aimed at ensuring environmentally sustainable improvements in population health."
The Association of The Built Environment with Metabolomics and Cancer Risk,"['Aravindakshan, Atul']",['N/A'],"['Breast Cancer', 'Built Environment', 'Cancer Risk', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Lung Cancer', 'Metabolomics', 'Prostate Cancer']",105000.0,460914,"Cancers have been the leading cause of death in Canada at least since the early 2000s. The built environment is the infrastructure and its layout made by humans such as urban green spaces, road networks, and residential and commercial establishments, and there is a growing interest in studying its effect on health, including the risk of cancer. Built infrastructure, such as recreational spaces and walking paths, have resulted in increased physical activity promoting a healthier lifestyle. However, improved infrastructure with increased road connectivity, sidewalk completeness, and access to parks could be associated with increased population density and accompanying negative consequences such as increased pollution levels. Environmental exposures such as air pollution, the extent of greenness and ambient light at night, and modifiable lifestyle factors such as physical activity, diet, smoking, and alcohol intake have been shown to influence the risk of cancer.
These environmental and lifestyle factors also affect the levels of metabolites, which are small-molecule biochemicals, such as proteins, in the human body. Metabolites are closely related to disease characteristics and are routinely used for diagnosis, studying disease processes, and discovering disease pathways, including those related to cancer.

The study aims to combine data from the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow's Health (CanPath), the Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research Consortium (CANUE), and the Where Matters: Health & Economic Benefits Study to investigate the combined effect of the built environment and lifestyle factors on the risk of breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancers in British Columbia and Alberta. In addition, to improve our understanding of how the built environment influences health, the study will use previously generated biochemical data in British Columbia to uncover metabolites associated with various aspects of the built environment."
Correlates of suicidality among a community-based cohort of women sex workers: The protective effect of social cohesion,"['Argento, Elena']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2650.0,391549,"Background: Suicide is a critical public concern globally. Sex workers experience disproportionately elevated risks and rates of morbidity and mortality, yet empirical research on suicide risk among marginalized women is limited. This study therefore aimed to longitudinally investigate the burden and socio-structural correlates of suicidality among women sex workers in Vancouver, Canada. 

Methods: Data (2010-2017) were drawn from a community-based, prospective cohort of women sex workers known as AESHA (An Evaluation of Sex Workers Health Access). Participants completed biannual interviewer-administered questionnaires and correlates of suicidality (suicide attempts or ideation) in the last six months were analyzed using bivariate and multivariable logistic regression with generalized estimating equations (GEE). 

Results: Of a total 867 participants at baseline, 16% (n=141) reported suicidality in the last six months, and 29% reported suicidality at some point during the study; 38% of women identified as Indigenous. In final multivariable analysis, the following factors were independently associated with suicidality: physical and/or sexual childhood abuse, mental health issues (depression/anxiety/post-traumatic stress disorder), intimate partner violence, physical and/or sexual violence by clients, and homelessness. Older age and higher social cohesion among women were significantly associated with reduced risk of suicide. 

Conclusions: These findings reveal key socio-structural correlates of suicidality among women sex workers, including past trauma, partner violence, and homelessness. Strengthening social cohesion among sex workers may have a protective effect on suicidality. Trauma-informed and community-led structural interventions tailored to women sex workers are urgently needed alongside a legal framework that enables collectivization and connectedness."
Digital Health and Artificial Intelligence based Platform for Early Chronic Disease Risk Assessment and Prediction to Improve Population Health,"['Abidi, Samina R', 'Abidi, Syed S', 'Sweeney, Ellen']","['Christie, Sean D', 'Kim, Jong Sung', 'Loubani, Osama', 'Tennankore, Karthik K', 'Young-Shand, Kathryn L']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Behaviour Modification', 'Chronic Diseases', 'Dashboard', 'Data Visualization', 'Digital Health', 'Lifecourse Health', 'Multi-Morbidity Risk', 'Population Health', 'Risk Assessment']",99970.0,468873,"51.6% of Canadians over the age of 20 live with at least one chronic disease. This has led to a rise in multimorbidity, i.e. more than one diseases at the same time. Chronic disease patients cost the Canadian economy $190 billion/year, i.e. 67% of all direct healthcare costs.
The available risk assessment tools do not inform the person about the multi-morbidity risk and do not provide the underlying risk factors contributing to the onset of a chronic disease. Given recent advances in digital health, consumer health technologies (wearable health devices and smart mobile devices) and Artificial Intelligence we now have real opportunities for proactive and personalized chronic disease risk assessment based on the combination and analysis of the individual's physiological and psychosocial profile. 
Our objective is to develop a digital health/e-health enabled Personalized Risk Investigation, Stratification and Mitigation (PRISM) platform, to allow (a) self-assessment of chronic disease risks based on integration of health data (b) Visualize the calculated risks via an interactive dashboard accessible via the web.
To develop PRISM, we will (a) Develop a computerized model to model the interactions between risk factors, risks, diseases, multi-morbidity and mitigation interventions (b) Develop the PRISM interactive health dashboard using visual analytics technologies."

Overall, new treatments contribute to the increasing life expectancy and improved health of Canadians. However, some medications currently available on the market may have important un-intended adverse health effects. Furthermore, it is not always clear which of the alternative medications, available to treat a given disease offer the maximum benefits to the patients. The above concerns are reflected in frequent 'research queries', initiated by Health Canada or provincial agencies that regulate medications availability and use, regarding either the safety or the therapeutic effectiveness of specific medications. To address such queries, researchers require high-quality data on drug use and health outcomes among the users, as well as sophisticated research methods. To provide accurate and timely responses to queries concerning safety or benefits of particular drugs, currently used by Canadians, we have created a highly inter-disciplinary network of 35 researchers, from 13 universities in 6 Canadian provinces, who provide complementary clinical and methodological expertise. In the past 2.5 years, our team has already completed or initiated several research projects that address recent drug-related queries. With this highly qualified and experienced team we aim to establish and reinforce Canada's position as the international leader in research on effectiveness and safety of the medications. Our state-of-the-art scientific methods will help identifying adverse effects of some medications and compare the benefits of alternative drugs, currently used to treat many diseases. This will help optimize drug prescribing practice and, in turn, will ultimately lead to both more rational use of health care resources and improved health for Canadians."
"New statistical methods for population-based studies of time-varying drug exposures: development, validation, and real-world analyses of drug safety and effectiveness","['Abrahamowicz, Michal M']","['Avina-Zubieta, Juan A', 'Bérard, Anick', 'Bernatsky, Sasha R', 'Dixon, William G', 'Durand, Madeleine', 'Eder, Lihi', 'Ferreira Guerra, Steve', 'Lacaille, Diane V', 'Perreault, Sylvie', 'Pilote, Louise', 'Sapir-Pichhadze, Ruth', 'Tamblyn, Robyn M', 'Widdifield, Jessica', 'Yi, Grace Y']","['Absolute Risks', 'Biostatistics', 'Cumulative Effects', 'Drug Safety And Effectiveness', 'Exposure Measurement Errors', 'New Methods', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Simulations', 'Time-Varying Exposures', 'Unmeasured Confounding']",481950.0,453430,"Ensuring the safety and effectiveness of drugs used to treat or prevent different diseases is essential for improving population health. Yet, some medications have serious unintended side effects or may be less effective than alternative drugs. Thus, an accurate assessment and comparison of the safety and effectiveness of medications currently used by Canadians is among the main priorities for health research, public health agencies and the general population. However, rigorous scientific assessment of real-world drug safety and effectiveness requires large population-based studies, which pose many analytical challenges. For example, patients prescribed a new drug may be more likely to have a more advanced disease and additional risk factors than receivers of a less expensive older drug. Thus, the observed differences in health outcomes between the users of alternative drugs may be due to differences in their characteristics, rather than to drugs' properties, and complex analyses are necessary to reduce bias and avoid incorrect conclusions. Furthermore, studies of drugs used in clinical practice have to account for treatment duration and drug doses, and for the possible treatment non-adherence, where some patients may take lower doses than prescribed or even stop using the drug. In addition, patients' responses to treatment may depend on their sex, age, and/or general health. To address these methodological challenges, we propose to develop and validate several new statistical methods for large population-based studies of medications. The use of the proposed new methods in large Canadian and international pharmacoepidemiology studies will permit more accurate assessments of the real-world safety and effectiveness of drugs used by Canadians to treat arthritis, infections, and cardiovascular diseases, or taken during pregnancy. Our new methods may also help improve drug prescribing, increasing health benefits while reducing the risks of serious adverse events."

For over a decade, I have made substantial contributions to address the public health needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, questioning, and 2-spirit (LGBTQ2S) youth experiencing homelessness. I am an internationally recognized leader and only one of a few Canadian researchers studying LGBTQ2S youth homelessness. My program of research focuses on preventing, reducing, and ending LGBTQ2S youth homelessness in Canada and internationally. 

I am an Early Career Investigator, having achieved a full time, independent position in 2016; yet, my research has led to significant practice and policy reform, and has changed the response to youth homelessness, both nationally and internationally. I have consulted with all levels of government to ensure the delivery of affirming and safe healthcare and social services to the LGBTQ2S population. My research and advocacy led to Canada's first transitional housing program for LGBTQ2S youth, as well as Canada's first provincial strategy addressing LGBTQ2S youth homelessness. 

Leadership, mentorship, and capacity building are key tenets of my scholarship. I support students in a range of disciplines, including public health, psychiatry, medicine, and social work, demonstrating the interdisciplinary impact of my research. My commitment to evidence-based research and advocacy has led to exceptional contributions in the areas of coherent intersectoral action for population health improvements, scalable population health solutions, and equitable population health impacts. Over the years, my program of research has resulted in solutions to complex population and public health issues, leading to real world change and life-saving programs and policies for some of the most marginalized young people."
Identifying and Examining Health Outcomes and Healthcare Utilization Among Transgender Adolescents and Youth Accessing Gender-Affirming Care in Ontario: A Mixed-Methods Study,"['Abramovich, Alex']","['Anderson, Kelly K', 'Khatchadourian, Karine', 'Kiran, Tara', 'Logie, Carmen', 'Saewyc, Elizabeth M', 'Shokoohi, Mostafa', 'Some, Nibene Habib', 'Vandermorris, Ashley']","['Administrative Health Data', 'Adolescents And Youth', 'Health Outcomes', 'Healthcare Utilization', 'Mental Health', 'Mixed Methods', 'Qualitative Interviews', 'Transgender']",401626.0,462354,"Transgender adolescents and youth experience high rates of stigma, discrimination, and identity-based rejection leading to poor health outcomes, including suicidality, substance use, depression, and anxiety. However, general health and healthcare utilization continues to be among the most understudied areas in transgender research, especially among transgender adolescents and youth. The goal of this mixed-methods study is to build a comprehensive understanding of the specific health outcomes, healthcare utilization patterns, experiences accessing the healthcare system, and health needs among transgender adolescents and youth (12-24 years) accessing gender-affirming care in Ontario, by utilizing administrative health data and in-depth one-on-one interviews. During the first phase of this study, we propose to identify 3,000 transgender adolescents and youth through data obtained from community and hospital clinics, which will be linked with administrative health data to examine the health outcomes and healthcare utilization patterns among transgender youth. During the second phase, we will conduct in-depth one-on-one interviews with a group of 60 transgender adolescents and youth to explore their reflections and understand the phase one quantitative results in more depth. This proposed study will be the first in Canada to identify transgender adolescents and youth within population-based health administrative data and investigate their health outcomes and healthcare utilization patterns. This project has the potential to transform existing services for adolescents and youth and provide evidence-informed recommendations for new and improved medical and social services for transgender youth. Findings will be used to make recommendations for the development of affirming and inclusive health services and/or interventions that support transgender youth to grow and develop into healthy adults."

Activity Begins in Childhood (ABC)- a randomized controlled trial to inspire healthy active behaviour in preschoolers,"['Adamo, Kristi B']","['Barrowman, Nicholas J', 'Colley, Rachel C', 'Goldfield, Gary S', 'Naylor, Patti-Jean', 'Temple, Viviene A']","['Accelerometer', 'Daycare', 'Early Childhood Educators', 'Early Intervention', 'Family', 'Health Benefits', 'Healthy Development', 'Motor Skill Development', 'Physical Activity', 'Preschool Children']",307482.0,255123,"Physical activity (PA) is an important part of healthy childhood development. Typical Canadian preschoolers spend a great deal of time in daycare, environments which can have a very strong influence on their levels of daily movement. PA levels are low in these settings, with kids spending lots of time sitting.  This project will test the ability of daycare providers to incorporate PA into the daily routine when they are provided with appropriate training and tools to do so.  We will also look at whether engaging the parents and asking them to facilitate PA at home provides additional benefit.  We will use what is called a randomized control design.  This is a type of research study that 'randomly' (like flipping a coin) assigns people, or in this case, daycares, to one group or another.  We are going to have 3 groups to compare.  One group of daycare providers will be trained to increase all types of PA and reduce time spent sitting around. Another group of providers will have the same training but parents of kids in their care will also receive training on how to incorporate PA into their child's daily routine. The last group of daycares will offer their typical curriculum.  Over the course of 6 months we will measure PA using a device called an accelerometer (a 'super' pedometer) and measure height & weight.  We will also evaluate whether the intervention improved motor skills, which includes things like jumping, catching and throwing.  At the end we will compare groups to see if one performed better than the others.  We are intervening in preschoolers, because this is a group that is highly affected by the setting they are in and role models they interact with.  This will be the first study in Canada attempting to modify PA behaviour in licensed daycare centres and looking at parental involvement.   This is important because inactivity is highly predictive of development of chronic diseases like obesity and heart disease and prevention must start early."

Recognizing the need to honor and draw attention to 'connection to land' as an Indigenous determinant of health through the PHWA, the FNHA and PHO partnered on a study to explore the concept through intimate gatherings with First Nations knowledge keepers in their own territories. With the study near completion, the project team is looking to disseminate the findings in a way that is impactful, respectful and honors Indigenous ways of knowing and sharing. Conventional knowledge translation (KT) initiatives and Western approaches to reporting data and research findings do not align with Indigenous ways of sharing. To effectively transfer, disseminate and integrate knowledge, the proposed project will draw from traditional Indigenous KT methods, including oral traditions, experiential knowledge, and cross-cultural knowledge sharing. The primary objective of the project will be to develop a culturally-grounded videographic KT tool based on findings from a recent study titled ""First Nations Health and Wellness Indicator Development in British Columbia: The Role of Indigenous Knowledge"". The project will host a series of engagement sessions with research participants (Indigenous knowledge keepers and youth) to collaboratively design, develop and co-produce a short-film based on study findings and footage of the gatherings. The short-film will serve as a method to scale up the dissemination of study findings with the goal of enhancing knowledge to action (KTA) related to land as a determinant of health among key knowledge users including First Nations community members and health system partners."

Threading gender to a suicide prevention program targeting Canadian Inuit male youth,"['Affleck, William P']",['N/A'],"['Gender And Health', 'Gender And Mental Health', 'Indigenous Mental Health', 'Indigenous Suicide', 'Inuit Mental Health', 'Suicide']",90000.0,376241,"Within the last 30 years, the rate of suicide amongst young Inuit men and boys has increased exponentially. It is currently 500 per 100,000, 40 times greater than the rate for age matched men in the rest of Canada (12.6 per 100,000). Indeed, Inuit boys between 15-19 are at a higher risk of suicide than any other sub-population in the world. Like many health issues, men's mental illness and suicide are deeply gendered. However, to date, no research has systematically explored the connections between masculinities and Inuit male youth suicide, nor has gender been thoughtfully considered in suicide prevention programs. Using a Participatory Action Research Design (PAR) and innovative qualitative methods, this project seeks to understand the connections between masculinities and Inuit male youth experiences of mental illness and suicidality. Understanding these diverse connections is critical for developing targeted and effective mental health and suicide prevention programs. This study will help to inform communities, clinicians, and policy-makers in how to design gender-sensitive programs and messaging to attract and retain Inuit male youth to their interventions. It will also make an important theoretical contribution. As a focus of health scholarship, masculinity has largely been theorised and studied with white anglo-saxon populations. This project will provide much-needed knowledge about the applicability of masculinity theory in non-Western populations."

It is estimated that every year, millions of children are abused and neglected worldwide. Our research team has found that 32% of the general population in Canada reported experiencing child abuse including physical abuse, sexual abuse, and/or exposure to violence in the home.  Findings from our study have furthered knowledge on the size and scope of child abuse in Canada and informed decisions for health care providers and policy makers in the country. In addition, our research has also shown that sex difference exist in relation to the prevalence of different types of child abuse in Canada with males (31%) being more likely to experience physical abuse compared to females (21.3%) but less likely than females to experience sexual abuse (5.8% vs 14.4%). Our team has also published many studies on sex differences among male and females in the relationship between child abuse and poor mental health and substance use outcomes. What remains unknown is if gender identity (socially constructed roles, behaviours, expressions and identities of girls, women, boys, men, and gender diverse people) and sexual identity (refers to a person's physical, romantic and/or emotional attraction) differences exist related to child abuse experiences and mental health and substance use outcomes. The current proposal aims to update and extend knowledge as our previous study conducted a decade ago and to answer essential questions about the epidemiology of child abuse in Canada that remain unknown. We will compute updated national and provincial prevalence of child abuse in Canada. We will aim to understand the experiences of child abuse among those with different gender identities and sexual identities and how this impacts mental health and substance use outcomes across age cohorts in Canada."

Each region of Inuit Nunangat has established a Regional Action Plan for the Elimination of TB. Nunavik is the region of Inuit Nunangat in Quebec, and a key element of its TB Elimination Plan is the deployment of Community Health Workers (CHWs) into the teams providing frontline TB prevention and care services in Nunavik villages. CHWs are community members who work to meet specific health needs of their community without health professional training. The Nunavik Regional Board of Health & Social Services (NRBHSS), the Inuit health authority in Nunavik, is creating a CHW role in its TB services. The goal of our project is to develop and pilot a training program for the formation of CHWs on TB prevention and care activities in Nunavik, that is informed by Nunavimmiut (Inuit of Nunavik) values and knowledge, including culturally-relevant and effective approaches to teaching. This will be achieved by working with Nunavimmiut to co-create a vision of what CHWs working on TB will do in Nunavik, and to co-develop the educational programme. We will work together then to pilot and evaluate the programme in two villages that are highly affected by TB, with the community and stakeholders deciding what to base the evaluation on. Our endeavour is a partnership between the NRBHSS and researchers and clinicians with expertise in community-based participatory-research with Indigenous populations, and in TB."

An intervention study of prenatal air pollution exposure and its impacts on cardiometabolic and respiratory health in children,"['Allen, Ryan']","['Lanphear, Bruce P', 'Lear, Scott A', 'McCandless, Lawrence', 'Takaro, Timothy K', 'Venners, Scott']","['Air Pollution', 'Asia', 'Developmental Programming', 'Dohad', 'Environmental Health', 'Intervention', 'Pregnancy', 'Prenatal']",699976.0,403425,"Globally over 380 million individuals under the age of 19 are overweight or obese, including 41 million children under age five. Among other effects, excess weight in childhood is linked with reduced lung function and chronic disease in adulthood. Most previous research on children has focused on diet and physical activity, but given the rising prevalence and potential for lifelong impacts it is important to identify other risk factors. Moreover, most interventions have targeted school-aged children, but the risk of overweight/obesity may be ""programmed"" early in life so there is a need for prevention at earlier stages of development.

There is evidence that air pollution exposure during pregnancy may cause the fetus to undergo changes that affect health later in life. Air pollution is the most widespread environmental risk factor - nearly 90% of the world's population breathes air that is considered unhealthy - so developmental effects from prenatal exposure could have major public health implications for generations to come. Unfortunately, the few studies conducted to date have had important limitations and have not evaluated the potential for exposure
interventions during pregnancy to reduce the risks of overweight/obesity or impaired lung function in childhood.

Portable indoor air cleaners represent a promising intervention because they are relatively inexpensive and reduce concentrations indoors, where individuals spend the majority of time. In our ongoing CIHR-funded birth cohort study in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia - one of the world's most polluted cities - we randomly allocated pregnant participants to an intervention or control group, with participants in the intervention group operating air cleaners in their homes during pregnancy. We propose to extend follow-up of children in this cohort to assess the impacts of prenatal air pollution on growth and development and to evaluate the potential for a simple intervention to reduce those impacts."

Historically, community-wide TB screening has significantly reduced TB incidence among Canadian Inuit; however, it is labour-intensive and could take decades to complete. Better tools are needed to improve our ability to screen for TB in remote regions. Wastewater testing for COVID-19 has been used worldwide during the pandemic to screen populations in real-time. As a result, mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacteria that causes TB, has been identified in wastewater. The proposed study aims to follow TB trends in wastewater in Iqaluit, Nunavut, to see if this information can allow Inuit and their health providers to apply public health interventions to treat and stop TB transmission in their communities more effectively. The study will develop a sample logistical pathway for different established molecular tests and determine the significance of Mtb levels in wastewater. The study aims to use this tool to detect TB in buildings housing people at high risk for developing TB and to link this information to public health interventions. Lastly, the study will evaluate the feasibility of a community-wide TB wastewater screen. This study brings together four key disciplines: Nunavut TB clinical epidemiology (Alvarez), wastewater surveillance (Delatolla), TB-specific microbiology (Sun), and Inuit-specific research (Allen). We expect the outcome of this research will provide Inuit and their healthcare providers with a new tool that will assist in identifying and prioritizing those most at risk for TB, avoiding mass clinical testing of all individuals. This way, the public health teams can provide focused, efficient, and rapid clinical care to prevent the spread of this disease as we work toward TB elimination."

Canadian research conducted earlier in the pandemic (i.e., May-Dec, 2020) indicated that 35%-42% of youth ages 15-24 years reported being unsure or unwilling to receive the vaccine due to concerns about safety, efficacy, and a general lack of knowledge regarding vaccines. As of July 31, 2021, only 47% of 12-17-year-olds and 51% of 18-29-year-olds were fully vaccinated (73% and 70% at least one dose, respectively), demonstrating a need to understand and address vaccine confidence in this underrepresented population. 

To address this priority, we will first test a model of vaccine confidence in Canadian youth (ages 12-29 years) by answering the following questions: 1. What are the rates of vaccine acceptance among Canadian youth? 2. What are the key factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and uptake among Canadian youth? 3. What factors are associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and uptake among equity-seeking groups? Second, there has been limited information targeted towards youth, with most youth relying on parents or the internet to obtain health information, with this reliance associated with increased conspiracy beliefs and vaccine hesitancy in the literature. Social media and app-based methods have been shown to be appropriate for health messaging to young people. In collaboration with two youth advisories, we will co-develop, design, and disseminate a youth-focused app and social media ad campaign that aim to increase vaccine confidence among Canadian youth. 

Results will aid the public health response to the pandemic by generating high-quality information about drivers of vaccine hesitancy, and informing how to best approach fostering vaccine confidence among youth. Outputs will include youth targeted interventions developed by and for this underrepresented population."

Decolonizing childbirth with Nunavik Inuit women transferred to high-risk hospitals for childbirth: a co-designed pilot intervention,"['Andersson, Neil', 'Budgell, Richard']","['Cockcroft, Anne', 'Vang, Zoua', 'Wou, Karen']","['Child Birth', 'Cultural Safety', 'Decolonization', 'Health Services', 'Indigenous Women', 'Maternal Health', 'Participatory Research']",1718955.0,408284,"BACKGROUND
Inuit women in Canada carry a disproportionate burden of poor health, with higher rates of maternal mortality and negative birth outcomes. Some 14% of Inuit women in Nunavik (Inuit territory in Quebec) travel to tertiary southern hospitals for specialized obstetric care (a process known as fly-out births). Fly-out births are linked to adverse health outcomes for Inuit women, their families and communities. This participatory research supports culturally safe Inuit childbirth, and will co-design pilot interventions with Inuit stakeholders and their care providers, to inform the decolonization of obstetric care in Quebec tertiary hospitals. 
METHODS
The study engages Nunavik-based Inuit women, their families and community members, as well as perinatal healthcare providers and policy makers in Nunavik and Montreal. With each group, a series of group fuzzy cognitive mapping sessions will explore experiences with fly-out childbirth and perspectives of decolonization in obstetric care. Individual and household questionnaires will document the frequency of these findings. Stakeholders will co-design an intervention through deliberative dialogue and community meetings. Recommendations will be shared with obstetrical staff of a Montreal tertiary hospital. A follow-up survey will measure quantitative changes in birth outcomes, patient satisfaction, and decolonizing care practices. An integrated knowledge translation and exchange strategy engages stakeholders in cognitive mapping sessions, and co-design interventions in deliberative dialogue. 
DISCUSSION
Evacuation for childbirth aims to reduce health disparities faced by Inuit women, yet it is inadvertently associated with adverse health outcomes. Affirming Inuit values of childbirth and engaging Inuit voices in service delivery improvement can support culturally safe care. The protocol and instruments developed may have wider relevance for rural Inuit across Canada."

There is no standard way to implement cultural safety, because it is specific to different groups and even to individual communities. It is also tricky to reduce systemic racism when the official position of the Quebec government is that this does not exist. 

Cultural safety in Nunavik must ""walk on two legs"", with Inuit patients and communities authoring cultural safety and non-Inuit health workers authoring alternatives to racism. Scoping reviews will collate literature on cultural safety and anti-racism interventions. Cognitive mapping will collate how Inuit and non-Inuit see cultural safety and racism. Focus groups or key informant interviews will clarify words and issues surfaced by the mapping. Surveys will measure experiences of cultural safety or its absence. This evidence will feed evidence into deliberative dialogue, allowing service providers and communities to co-design evidence-based solutions. 

A year4 repeat survey will compare (before/after) health and care seeking behaviours, and ripple effects like cultural continuity and job satisfaction of service providers. A narrative evaluation will document the most significant change for service providers and Inuit communities. We will develop multi-media training modules for non-Inuit and Inuit health workers and for other health facilities wanting to develop community-led cultural safety and anti-racism interventions.

This participatory research engages Inuit communities and the hospitals serving them, the Nunavik Regional Board for Health and Social Services (TBC) and McGill Family Medicine. The project will last five years."
Reviving social interaction for healthy aging: participatory engagement of older adults in dementia prevention in rural African and Montreal contexts,"['Andersson, Neil', 'Abbasgholizadeh Rahimi, Samira', 'Cockcroft, Anne', 'Geddes, Maiya R', 'Wilchesky, Machelle']","['Batisi, Ogopoleng', 'Belaid, Loubna', 'Bergman, Howard', 'Chakravarty, Megha M', 'de Medeiros, Kate', 'Grimard, Franque', 'Hachinski, Vladimir', 'Mitchell, Claudia', ""O'Connell, Megan E"", 'Phillips, Natalie A', 'Pichora-Fuller, Margaret K', 'Sarmiento, Ivan', 'Sawchuk, Kim A', 'Thabane, Lehana', 'Wittich, Walter']","['Dementia Prevention', 'Participatory Research', 'Social Dimensions Of Aging', 'Social Interaction']",888165.0,489564,"This pilot study tests the implementation feasibility, assessment and data management of a participatory intervention with older adults in Montreal and a rural LMIC setting. Our pilot explores three mechanisms of a participatory intervention with older adults and their caregivers: i) share control of the research in ways that balance their shared interests; ii) use recent local evidence about the shared concern and decisions on what to do about it; and iii) innovate to address shared problems. Our question is whether these three dynamics can revitalize brain function in a way that might reduce dementia. In this exploratory study to identify study populations, protocols and participation dynamics, we will recruit older women and men in Montreal and two very similar rural communities in Botswana. A baseline survey will document access to and use of services, problems with services, social networks, and support mechanisms. We will measure cognitive status using standard neuropsychology tools. In intervention groups of older adults, we will collate evidence, discuss solutions, and share results using visual and arts-based communication, allowing participants to review their own living conditions and to help fix their priority issues. We will compare before and after measurements with those receiving the usual care for their situation. We expect to demonstrate implementation and assessment feasibility, and indicative data management within the project life. In addition, the intervention will improve care and services for participating older adults. The visual/arts-based communication allows care givers and healthcare providers to know about aging through the eyes of those who live it, levelling the playing field for those with hearing and other disabilities. This study is a pilot for a randomised controlled future trial to assess the impact of authentic research participation on dementia."
"The alcohol-harm paradox and health equity impacts of alcohol policy in Canada: Evidence to inform the complex relationships across alcohol policy, consumption, and harms","['Andreacchi, Alessandra T']",['N/A'],"['Alcohol Consumption', 'Alcohol Harm Paradox', 'Alcohol Harms (Hospitalization, Mortality)', 'Alcohol Policies (Availability)', 'Health Equity', 'Mediation Analysis', 'Socioeconomic Inequities']",105000.0,458885,"Studies show lower socioeconomic status (SES) groups experience greater alcohol-related illnesses and deaths compared to higher SES groups, even when consuming lower quantities of alcohol. Known as the ""alcohol-harm paradox"", this phenomenon is well documented in research but proposed explanations for these differences are complex, poorly understood, and have not fully explained differences in alcohol-related harms. Clarifying the mechanisms involved in creating the alcohol-harm paradox is essential to designing equitable alcohol policies. One policy to reduce alcohol-related harms is to restrict increases in alcohol availability. An improved understanding is urgently needed in jurisdictions where alcohol availability has increased, such as in Ontario, where sales were expanded to grocery stores and restaurant takeout. It is largely unknown how such deregulations in alcohol sales affect social inequities in alcohol harms, which are health differences that are considered to be preventable and unfair. The purpose of the proposed research is to explore potential mechanisms for the inequitable impact of alcohol harms on lower SES groups (i.e., the alcohol-harm paradox) and to examine whether policies that increase alcohol availability contribute to social inequities in alcohol harms in Canada. The recent alcohol deregulation in Ontario presents a critical opportunity to understand how population-level policies may influence health inequities. This research will fill key gaps in evidence as it is the first in Canada to disentangle the causal mechanisms driving the alcohol-harm paradox. The results will directly inform targeted alcohol policies and equity strategies to better support priority populations in Canada."
A One Health approach to investigating the ecology of East African trypanosomiasis in Malawian wildlife,"['Anholt, Heather R']",['N/A'],"['Disease Ecology', 'Epidemiology', 'Molecular Techniques', 'Neglected Tropical Disease', 'One Health', 'Pcr', 'Sleeping Sickness', 'Trypanosomiasis', 'Veterinary Science', 'Wildlife Reservoir']",105000.0,476178,"Vector-borne zoonotic diseases (diseases transmitted between animals and people via arthropods) are re-emerging globally. A major threat to health, these typically neglected diseases are expected to increase given our limited capacity for detecting and addressing them. One such disease is trypanosomiasis, also known as 'sleeping sickness.' Trypanosomiasis is an important cause of human fatality in sub-Saharan Africa and causes significant illness in domestic animals and wildlife. Tsetse flies are the vector, transmitting the microscopic parasites, trypanosomes, within and among species. Malawi reports the highest number of trypanosomiasis deaths globally, yet there is almost no data on the disease there. The disease risk is complex, involving the tsetse vector, numerous wildlife species, domestic animals, and people. Further, the disease mainly affects marginalized Indigenous populations in rural areas. The One Health framework is a good approach for such research, as it specifically seeks to understand how animals, people, pathogens, and the environment intersect to promote or reduce health. This project uses a One Health framework to investigate the ecology of African trypanosomiasis at the intersections of the local people, the tsetse fly vector, the trypanosome parasites, and the wildlife host species. We will investigate the local communities' relationship with the protected forest habitat where wildlife and tsetse are found, describe the co-occurrence of tsetse and wildlife hosts to quantify tsetse feeding preferences, and relate trypanosome infection prevalence in tsetse to varying wildlife host densities. This work is important in exploring ways to protect people, livestock, and wildlife from the global infectious consequences of habitat encroachment and ecosystem change. In our interconnected world, Canadians can benefit directly from this research, as well as showcase our world leadership role as promoters of global public health."

The purpose of the meeting and site visit is to define the work that the Canadian and Bangladeshi teams will accomplish together. The intent is not to duplicate the work of other groups, but to build capacity to develop a cohort of People Who Injects Drugs (PWIDs) in Bangladesh. It will also help Canadian investigators work with Bangladeshi patients, especially PWIDs, including many with Hepatitis-C Virus (HCV) and/or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The site visit will also help the Canadian team know if the sites can become CTN 'affiliates' (official partners). The face-to-face meeting/site visit will also define training to be conducted among Bangladeshi team members, including the timing, participants, trainer(s), venue, etc. At this point, we can only say the broad areas of training involve Good Clinical Practice (GCP), project management, study management, and other skillsets related to cohort development. Shortly after the site visit to Bangladesh, two investigators (Drs. Azim and Rahman) will attend the spring 2015 CTN semi-annual meeting to be held in Toronto in late April. The objective will be to establish and/or solidify collaborative relationships between leading Canadian investigators and our Bangladeshi colleagues. Further, it will allow them to observe our ""engines of research"" and the core scientific teams, including the one most relevant to their areas of interest, the Concurrent Diseases and Co-morbidities Core."
Determinants of Quality of Life in Children with Cancer,"['Anthony, Samantha J']",['N/A'],"['Chronic Illness', 'Mixed Methodology', 'Oncology', 'Pediatrics', 'Quality Of Life', 'Systematic Review']",110000.0,194028,"There is growing interest in assessing quality of life (QOL) in children with cancer, especially now that most children survive their disease.  While validated measures have been used extensively to describe QOL, what is lacking is the availability of a theoretical model that describes factors and processes associated with QOL and that can be used to guide future research.  This study addresses this important gap in research and represents the first step in an innovative program of research that will help to better understand what factors can explain variability in QOL for children with cancer. A systematic review will be conducted of the scientific literature to identify all studies that measured QOL in children with cancer using validated pediatric generic or disease-specific QOL questionnaires.  The primary aim of the review is to extract information about factors related to QOL, including treatment variables, child characteristics, family variables and community factors; each forming part of the broader context within which the children live and which may influence their QOL. These findings will be used to develop a conceptual model of determinants of QOL and the model will be applied in a large-scale multi-center study of children with cancer and childhood cancer survivors. Understanding variables that can explain the different patterns of QOL, how these relate to important child, disease, family and community variables, and how these change over time, is a necessary first step towards designing interventions to improve the QOL of this vulnerable population. Assessment of child health-related QOL has typically relied on parents' proxy reports, but many questionnaires can also be completed by children themselves. There are, however, many questions remaining about parent-child agreement. A secondary aim of the review is to extract information about parent-child agreement about the child's QOL and to identify variables that may impact on parent-child agreement."

In Ontario, home to close to 40% of Canadian children and youth, school closures and stay-at-home orders have produced prolonged periods of social and physical isolation from classmates and extended family. Simultaneous disruptions in the availability of extracurricular activities and access to health care and specialized support services further increased the isolating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, predisposing children and youth to worsening mental health. However, there is limited research describing the impact of COVID-19-related public health measures on the mental health of children and youth. This is especially important for disadvantaged children and youth for whom the harmful effects of emergency measures may be worsened by pre-existing disadvantage, such as lack of internet access for remote learning or medical appointments, poverty, and living in neighbourhoods without parks or green space. Our goal is to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated restrictions (e.g., lockdowns, school closures) on the mental health of children and youth in Ontario. We will specifically study hospital admissions and emergency department visits for mental health conditions, emergency department visits for self-harm, and prescriptions for psychotropics (i.e., antidepressants, benzodiazepines, stimulants and antipsychotics). For each of these outcomes, we will study how their occurrence changed with COVID-19, whether there were differences according to the neighbourhood of residence, and the relationship with the duration of lockdowns and school closures. We will also study whether there were differences between females and males, by age group, between children and youth with and without mental health or neurodevelopmental conditions before the pandemic, and according to features of the neighbourhoods of residence."

The proposed project is an analysis of environmental and reproductive health in British Columbia, Yukon, and Alberta. The reproductive endpoints shown to reflect an exposure-disease relationship include low birth weight, premature births, small-for-gestational age, stillbirths and infant death. Low birth weight and small-for-gestational age are major determinants of morbidity and mortality among newborn infants, and are risk factors for behavioural and chronic disabilities later in life. The production of small-area disease risk maps are useful for monitoring and surveillance purposes by defining a baseline spatial disease pattern that can be reassessed over time. 

The methods employed for this project will incorporate spatial statistical techniques and epidemiological methods with the aid of geographical information systems (GIS). Statistical models will be used to produce reliable risk estimates of the specific birth outcomes at the community level. We have produced preliminary data utilizing birth data obtained from the BC Perinatal Health Program and environmental contaminant data from the National Pollutant Release Inventory and other national and provincial sources. The perinatal data include birth outcome and numerous maternal and antenatal risk factor data for all singleton births in BC from 2001 - 2006.

The goal is to produce a robust model capable of analyzing birth outcomes particularly attuned for remote and Aboriginal populations where the risk of environmental exposures is high. Ultimately, community health risk maps will serve to facilitate the formulation of health policy decisions with respect to the allocation of funding and resources to minimize environmental risk."
Investigating the contextual and behavioural determinants of sodium intake among adult Canadians,"['Arcand, JoAnne']","['Ahmed, Mavra', 'Franco Arellano, Beatriz', 'Kirkpatrick, Sharon', ""L'Abbe, Mary R"", 'Lou, Wen-Yi W', 'Pasha, Mahmooda K']","['Behaviour Theory', 'Diet', 'Education', 'Mixed Methods', 'Nutrition', 'Social Marketing', 'Sodium', 'Survey']",623476.0,451629,"Canadians consume large amounts of sodium, which increases their risk for heart disease and stroke. Strategies that support Canadians in following a lower sodium diet, like Canada's Food Guide, follow the idea that behaviour change can be achieved by increasing knowledge, alone. Yet, knowledge is only one part of behaviour change, which has shown minimal impact on sodium reduction to date. Therefore, it is important to understand the many internal and external factors related to sodium intake among Canadians to better inform sodium reduction strategies.

Most research on factors that impact Canadians' sodium intake is old (>10 years). It is unknown if these factors have changed over time, with the adoption of Canada's Sodium Reduction Strategy in 2010. Importantly, the research that has been conducted in Canada has been limited. The surveys administered in the past mostly focused on informing policies for sodium, and it did not study how and why people behave the way they do, and what some of the barriers and motivators are to following a lower sodium diet. 

Our team will conduct research to deepen our understanding of what factors impact a person's sodium intake and food choices. We will develop a survey capturing the contextual (e.g., health literacy) and behavioural (e.g., perceived risks of sodium, attitudes towards sodium, intention to reduce sodium) factors related to sodium intake. The survey will be administered to 3380 Canadian adults, who will also complete diet recalls so that we can estimate how much sodium they eat. This data will allow us to 1) monitor changes in key factors of sodium intake over a 10-year time frame, 2) assess the behavioural and contextual factors impacting sodium intake among Canadian adults, and 3) determine whether these factors are associated with lower sodium intakes. 

This research will be the first of its kind. It will help us develop better strategies to support people in reducing their sodium intake."

Therapies that improve cannabis use disorder better than standard treatment do not exist. Furthermore, few studies examine what young people with early-phase psychosis from Black racialized communities understand about this relationship - even though they may be the ones most at risk. Innovative strategies that raise awareness of this relationship could represent a significant contribution to solving these problems. This project will be carried out with the Free For All Foundation, serving Black racialized communities.

Objectives: This project will evaluate the use of new video games - The Back to Reality Video Game SERIES (SERIES), featuring a Black youth as the hero, with emerging psychosis who uses cannabis. To this end, this project explores what young people with early-phase psychosis/cannabis use disorder understand about the impact of cannabis on their psychosis experiences before and after playing the SERIES. 

Methods: Participants will meet criteria for a first episode of a psychotic disorder and a cannabis use disorder. Participants will be Black African (24 people), Black Caribbean (24) descent {English speaking], or any ethnicity French-speaking (10). We will invite them to tell us their stories about their psychosis and cannabis experiences before playing the SERIES. After playing either the SERIES or a control game, a quiz will measure their knowledge about the relationship between cannabis and psychosis. 

Impact: The voices of young people from racialized communities will generate new knowledge about the meaning of race, cannabis use and psychosis to inform use of a new KT product. It will deal with gaps in knowledge about cannabis use for people experiencing early-phase psychosis from Black communities, possibly leading to new strategies to improve cannabis use disorder in this population."
Investigating the socio-structural context and impact of new Canadian legislation and criminal policies (C-36) on HIV/STI risks among sex workers and their clients,"['Argento, Elena']",['N/A'],"['Criminalization', 'Drug Use', 'Hiv Prevention', 'Sex Workers', 'Structural Violence']",108000.0,338166,"In Canada and globally, sex workers continue to experience high rates of HIV/STI (sexually transmitted infection), violence, and poor access to health care services. Despite the significance of socio-structural factors (e.g., laws, stigma, social support) in influencing the HIV epidemic, large research gaps remain in our understanding of how these factors affect HIV/STI risks for sex workers. For the first time in Canadian history, new sex work legislation (C-36, implemented December 2014), criminalizes purchasing (clients) and advertising the sale of sexual services, while the selling of sex remains legal. These policies have been adopted in Canada despite the lack of evidence supporting this legal framework and an absence of research on health impacts and HIV/STI risks for sex workers. The aim of the proposed study is to investigate the impact of new sex work laws and enforcement-based policies on HIV/STI risks (e.g., drug use patterns, violence, condom use, access to care) among sex workers and clients in Vancouver, Canada. This project will draw on empirical survey data gathered from a larger longitudinal cohort study of women sex workers in Vancouver and will employ advanced social epidemiological modelling techniques to make use of the longitudinal data before and after the legal reforms. This work will be complimented by in-depth interviews with sex workers and clients recruited through a paired cohort study of men who purchase and sell sex. Given the high HIV/STI burden among sex workers and lack of research on the health impacts of criminalization of sex work in Canada and globally, there is a critical need to translate the findings into health policy and practice. Knowledge translation of the research findings to local community and international partners will help to inform ongoing developments in public health policies to reduce the risks for HIV, as well as provide evidence for upcoming Charter challenges."

Individuals search the Internet for information they use to support their decisions regarding prevention and treatment options. Unfortunately, many people do not have the literacy skills required for understanding health information. Numeracy--the ability to interpret and use numbers--is a significant aspect of health literacy and includes possessing and using quantitative knowledge and risk information required to manage one's health. However, many individuals have poor comprehension of quantitative information. To investigate older adults' health numeracy and risk comprehension of cancer information on the Internet, we will analyze cancer risk information directed to consumers, patients, and the general public. In particular, we will investigate older adults' comprehension of this Web-based information. In our studies, we will focus on colorectal cancer information.

We propose the following three specific research objectives: 

(1) To investigate older adults' health numeracy comprehension of colorectal cancer risk information on the Internet; (2) To determine how presentation of numerical colorectal cancer risk information (text versus graphical displays) influences older adults' health numeracy and comprehension of such information; (3) To characterize the cognitive processes underlying comprehension of cancer risk information by older adults presented in various formats (text or graphics). 

Our research has implications for the design of risk information involving numbers and graphics by determining the factors that affect comprehension of cancer risk information and the knowledge and reasoning processes underlying decision making under risk."

Booster seats are designed to elevate the child to an appropriate height to allow the safe use of a lap/shoulder belt. Considerable empirical work has been devoted to studying the impact of booster seats in reducing injury and death in child passengers. However, study results have been mixed; booster seats have been shown to be effective for preventing injury in younger children (under 8 years of age), whereas evidence of their effectiveness for older children is less clear.While Canadian children should be at least 40lbs to use a booster seat, the age, height, and weight at which the child is no longer required to use a booster differs by region; in some provinces and territories, booster seat laws are absent. No formal synthesis of the evidence evaluating booster seat effectiveness in reducing injury morbidity and mortality in child passengers has been completed. Governmental and many non-governmental organizations devoted to child health and road safety strongly endorse the use of booster seats to reduce childhood injuries. For these organizations to effectively advocate for improved road safety necessitates a solid evidence base to appropriately inform policy development.Objectives: Following the lead of the decision maker, Child Safety Link, the primary objective of this project is to complete a systematic review of the literature to answer the questions: Does booster seat use among child passengers aged 6-10 years of age reduce injury morbidity and mortality from motor vehicle collisions? Are estimates of booster seat effectiveness consistent for children of different ages, heights, and weights?Methods: Standard systematic review and meta-analysis. We will include all observational epidemiological studies evaluating the effectiveness of booster seat use on reducing child injury morbidity and mortality resulting from motor vehicle collisions, compared to children who use a standard shoulder/lap belt alone. Multiple electronic databases will be searched to identify relevant studies. Citation searches and inspection of previous literature reviews will be conducted, along with an examination of government reports. Two independent reviewers will assess study quality and risk of bias, and collect data on key study features: study design (e.g. case control, cohort), booster seat details (age and weight restrictions, backless) and control group (seat belt only). Additional analyses will be carried out as directed by decision makers.Data Synthesis: If warranted by the evidence, a meta-analysis will be performed using random effects modeling to synthesize data on the effect of booster seat use on child injury morbidity and mortality. Relevant subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be conducted.Knowledge Translation: Through ongoing consultation with decision makers and knowledge user partners, the primary KT goal is the translation of evidence to assist in the development of improved provincial policies to reduce injury and death among young motor vehicle passengers."
Acute cannabis consumption and motor vehicle collision risk: A systematic review of observational studies,"['Asbridge, Mark']","['Hayden, Jill A']","['Cannabis', 'Meta Analysis', 'Motor Vehicle Collision', 'Policy', 'Systematic Review']",38673.0,191821,"Impaired driving is a leading cause of preventable morbidity and mortality in Canada, and is a tremendous burden on health care. Recent evidence has shown cannabis as playing an important role in road safety. Surveys have demonstrated that driving under the influence of cannabis has caught up to, and in some instances passed, rates of driving under the influence of alcohol in many jurisdictions, while collision studies have found that the rate of cannabis in the blood of injured and fatally injured drivers has increased in recent years. Despite this, research findings on the effects of cannabis on driver impairment and collision risk have been mixed. Some studies suggest cannabis use increases the risk of a collision while others suggest no effect or a decreased risk. To date, no formal synthesis of the available evidence has been completed and only one literature review has been published in 1999. Over one dozen new observation studies have been published in the preceding years, with more under way. For government to combat drug impaired driving necessitates the availability of a solid evidence base to inform policy development. To address this shortcoming, we propose to complete a systematic review and meta analysis of the observational epidemiological literature to answer the question: Does the acute consumption of cannabis (cannabinoids, THC) among drivers increase the risk of a motor vehicle collision? We will employ standard systematic review and meta-analysis methods as advocated by the Cochrane Review group, including the literature search, study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment, analysis and reporting. If warranted by the evidence, a meta analysis will be performed. Our primary goal is the translation of evidence from this research into the development of provincial policy and programs to improve road safety. We will also engage other federal and provincial stakeholders to be involved in the dissemination and uptake of the research."

Recent estimates suggest the health and economic costs of injury in Canada is approaching $27 billion annually, with many thousand deaths and tens of thousands of hospitalizations. Adolescents are particularly at risk, with unintentional injury the leading cause of hospitalization among Canadians 10 to 19 years of age. 

Much of what we know about adolescent injury is taken from hospital and other administrative data, which provides excellent information about serious injuries requiring medical attention, as well as injury trends over time. Where hospital data are weak is in providing a broader picture of the substantial number of adolescent injuries that do not receive medical care, and in exploring the individual and social factors that lead to injury. A reliance on hospital data, alone, paints a limited picture of injury prevalence in Canada. These data tell us very little about what causes injury, and hinders the ability of those interested in injury prevention and control from making effective policy and program decisions. There is, however, a large body of survey data, collected provincially and nationally, that assesses adolescent injury and its key determinants. 

The primary objective of this project is to examine these survey data to understand adolescent injury rates, individual and social determinants of injury, and injury comorbidities, with particular attention to substance use and mental health. Our aim is to improve understanding of adolescent injury in Canada in ways that can inform the development of evidence-based policy and programs for injury prevention by our partners, provincial and federal government agencies, and other interested stakeholders."
"Optimizing Canada's low-risk drinking guidelines (LRDG): Examining emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and deaths amongst Canadian drinkers.","['Asbridge, Mark', 'Purcell, Judith Anne', 'Callaghan, Russell C']",['N/A'],"['Alcohol Consumption', 'Guidelines', 'Historical Cohort', 'International Comparative', 'Morbidity', 'Mortality']",99700.0,460182,"Alcohol is the most commonly consumed drug worldwide and is ubiquitous in most societies and cultures. The widespread consumption of alcohol, however, is associated with substantial societal harms and costs. Alcohol consumption contributes significantly to several important health and socials harms. In 2015-2016 alone, there were over 77,000 hospitalizations entirely caused by alcohol in Canada, and more than 5,000 alcohol-related deaths. To help to reduce these harms, many jurisdictions have created low-risk drinking guidelines (LRDG) -suggested daily, single-sitting, and/or weekly drink limits to minimize acute and chronic harms from alcohol consumption. Canada released its LRDG in 2011, which recommends no more than 2 drinks per day, 3 drinks in a single sitting, and 10 per week for women, and no more than 3 per day, 4 drinks in a single sitting, and 15 per week for men. To date, there has been limited research assessing the extent to which Canadians follow  these guidelines, and no studies have examined whether following them reduces the likelihood of subsequent alcohol-related health and social harms. To address this gap, this proposed study aims to explore the predictive validity of Canada's LRDG by analyzing acute and chronic outcomes wholly or partially attributable to alcohol in Canadians who: (1) consume alcohol in moderation, as per the guidelines; (2) abstain from drinking (in the past year/lifetime); and (3) those who are at a higher level of risk by exceeding established daily, weekly, or single-sitting drinking guideline limits. International comparison of drinking guidelines from other jurisdictions will be also be performed to further estimate optimal low-risk limits and to improve the accuracy of Canada's LRDG guideline for classifying drinkers at risk of subsequent alcohol-related harms. Results of this study will provide valuable insight and evidence to inform ongoing efforts to improve Canada's low-risk drinking guidelines."

Wastewater reuse has been accepted in countries like the U.S and Australia, but unlike these warm climate countries, Canada's cold climate poses challenges to treatment and consequently some uncertainty in the microbial threats to human health. There is also a lack of international agreement on guidelines/regulations that are protective of human health. Furthermore, there are concerns about new disease-causing agents in the wastes produced by modern societies (e.g., antibiotic-resistant bacteria). Sustainability of water reuse strategies also requires an understanding of the public's perceptions about wastewater reuse. The willingness of society to use recycled water has been shown to be dependent upon trust in government and utilities, as well as a perceived quality of the recycled water, financial value of the recycled water system, and associated health risks. From a Canadian economic perspective, it is estimated that the overall water/wastewater infrastructure deficit in Canada approximates $100 billion. Since water and wastewater infrastructure planning requires a 25 yr functional design life span for water treatment plants (and 50+ years for in ground services [pipes]), decisions regarding the investment needs for today 'lock-in' these urban design features for the next 25 or more years. As cities continue to grow and expand, failure to address the science and social acceptance of wastewater reuse in Canada today, will threaten the economic and environmental sustainability of future generations.  The goal of this research is develop a sustainable, socially-relevant, community engaged, evidence-based wastewater reuse strategy for Canada."

However, population growth, loss of environmental services and climate change are forcing communities to explore opportunities that treat municipal wastewater to allow its safe return for community uses or harvest rain/stormwater for various non-drinking water uses (all referred to here as wastewater reuse). There are also multiple synergies when wastewater reuse is considered within a broader, one-water approach that provides economic opportunities for society to reduce water service costs, provide resiliency to floods/droughts and promotes public health improvements while meeting future water demands. While wastewater reuse has been accepted in various arid, warm regions (including Arizona, California, Israel & Australia), Canada's cold climate poses uncharacterized challenges to wastewater treatment (e.g. sudden cold-water snowmelt events reducing treatment efficacy) and therefore uncertainty in the potential risks to human health posed by the recovered water. There is also a lack of international agreement on reuse guidelines/regulations that are protective of human health. Lastly, informed citizens are increasingly aware of new disease-causing agents produced by modern societies (e.g., antibiotic-resistant bacteria and respiratory pathogens that grow in distributed waters such as Legionella) and seek to engage in decision-making for new water services. Hence, water reuse strategies require an understanding of the public's perceptions and receptivity to wastewater reuse as well as technical understanding of how to control key hazards - major elements of the proposed participatory water reuse framework to engender trust in government and utilities to provide safe reuse water that communities seek to have in an equitable way to address Canada's $90 billion water service infrastructure deficit."

To illustrate, healthcare workers handle chemotherapy medications that are widely used to treat cancers and other immune diseases. These drugs are inherently hazardous and are capable of causing cancer, birth defects, and mutations in genes. Previous work has shown that healthcare facilities are contaminated and healthcare workers themselves continue to be exposed despite current best practices. With our aging population and increasing use chemotherapeutic drugs, the risk of exposure among healthcare workers is also increasing. Since multiple drugs or combinations are common, of concern is the effect of all of these on the health of healthcare workers. This research will gather evidence to improve our knowledge regarding how these drugs contaminate surfaces in hospitals and how this contamination spreads. We will use a new approach to address this problem by looking in detail at the flow of drugs, the people who handle them and the environment in which they work, all at the same time. We are describing this as the Antineoplastic Drug Contamination Network. The outcome of this research will identify methods that facility administrators in Canada can use to improve the safety of their workforce."

The program provides people living with dementia who have a caregiver that helps them with decision making and who are on the waitlist money to purchase personal care, respite, housekeeping and meal preparation. In giving people who are in a vulnerable situation money to purchase their own services, the program offers an innovative approach to continuing care service delivery. By supporting care at home, it has potential to enhance the quality of care of people living with dementia and improve the health and well-being of people living with dementia and their caregivers, as well as relieve some of the strains on the system that can drive costs, and influence the working conditions of care providers. While there is potential, evidence is still lacking. We do not know much about the program from the perspectives of people living with dementia, their caregivers and home care providers.

In women, midlife is strongly characterized by weight gain and increased health risks related to metabolic changes associated to menopause. Therefore prioritizing obese postmenopausal women is particularly relevant regarding this issue. To our knowledge, no social class analysis has focused on the susceptibilities of obese aging women to follow a weight-loss program. This research proposal focuses on disposition to loose weight of clinically obese postmenopausal women from contrasting social classes. The aims of this study are: 1) To identify the norms and values of clinically obese postmenopausal women of diverse socioeconomic background with regards to the ways of treating and caring for the body and to outline the socio-cultural processes which incline (or not) these individuals to pursue a weight loss strategies 2) To develop a theoretical and empirically-grounded account of the discursive and embodied effects of health and obesity discourses on obese aging women, 3) to understand how obese women are interpellated by dominant and/or alternative discourses on obesity. From a practical standpoint, this project will: A) develop knowledge that will assist health professionals in their contextualized interventions to improve obese women's health and weight management; B) inform those programs and policies that are intended to promote their participation in physical activity and other health practices; and C) provide information to help develop interventions that will better serve the goal of obese women's increased health and well-being."

The use of opioids is rising and substance use during pregnancy is more and more a problem. Little is known about substance use among Canadian pregnant women. Canada is only second to the US in opioid use among high income countries. This is concerning as fetuses exposed to substance use during pregnancy are at risk of low birth weight, premature birth, death, and potential health and behavioral issues. Mothers with substance use may be at risk of long term health effects, even after quitting. The long term outcomes of mothers with substance use and their infants are poorly understood. Better knowledge of health issues in women with substance use is necessary for physicians to better care for patients and prevent future health problems. The aim of this project is to assess long term health outcomes of women with substance use and their infants in Quebec.

We will look at hospitalization data for all women who ever gave birth in Quebec, Canada from 1989 to 2016. We will identify women with substance use before or during pregnancy and any health problems they had during delivery. We will follow the women and their children over time in the years after pregnancy to determine how substance use affects their later health.

This study will provide essential information on the growing problem of substance use during pregnancy in Canada. We will provide detailed data on the long term outcomes related to substance abuse and shed light on health issues of women and children that could be prevented earlier in life. Better knowledge of long term consequences of substance use for both women and children will improve identification and clinical management of affected patients."

Cardiovascular diseases cause the narrowing of the coronary arteries-the blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to the heart muscles. It is a big cause of hospitalization in Canada. Patients older than 65 years of age are mainly affected. Two common procedures used to treat cardiovascular diseases are percutaneous coronary interventions and coronary artery bypass grafting. These procedures help to unblock the arteries so that the heart can once again receive oxygen. However, discriminatory practices such as gender, place of residence (geography), ethnic discrimination, or socioeconomic status are preventing fair access to treatment choices. My research will look at how these discriminatory practices influence access to care, treatment choice, and death. I will use a large health records database to study a group of patients older than 65 years of age, with cardiovascular diseases that have undergone either one of the two available procedures. I will measure the number of patients with cardiovascular diseases per geographic region in the group that I created over a specified period. I will use postal code information or Local Community Service Centers region as the place of residence in Quebec. The result of my analysis will allow patients to have access to cardiovascular disease treatment in a fair, transparent, and equitable manner.

Nonetheless, in North America, Black women, and their babies, are at increased risk of adverse pregnancy and childbirth outcomes, and experiences of discrimination. Given that those who identify as Black are, on average, younger than the total population of Canada, it is reasonable to assume that the Black population will only continue to grow and require access to maternity programs and services. Further, given the increased recognition of anti-Black racism within Canada, following the murder of George Floyd, it is pertinent that we explore the pregnancy and birth experiences of Black people in Canada and identify any inequities. This study takes a mixed-methods, and intersectional approach to explore experiences of Black people throughout Canada who have accessed a range of perinatal services and resources.

Approximately 250000 Canadians have AF and these numbers are increasing over time. Patients with AF are at increased risk of stroke. Women with AF are at higher risk of stroke compared with men, however the reason for this is uncertain. It has been suggested that women with AF receive less preventive treatment for stroke than men.
The objectives of this study were to compare risk factors for stroke, patterns of prevention treatment for stroke, and stroke rates between sexes, in population of patients with AF older than 65 years.
to answer the study objectives, we used information from prescription drug, physicians claims and hospital discharge databases between 1999 and 2007. Patients consisted of 39,398 men (47.2%) and 44,115 women (52.8%). 
we found that women were older had fewer background diseases, but had higher risk for stroke. Women received the same extend of prevention treatment for stroke as men, however they still had higher rates of stroke (5.8% vs. 4.3%). Adherence to treatment was similar between sexes.
We concluded that women are not treated less than men to prevent stroke, however they fare worst. Stroke rates are higher in women compared with men, independent of risk factors and prevention treatment. Novel strategies are needed to reduce stroke risk in women with AF."

Alteration of infant microbiota has the potential to cause disease later in childhood. Antibiotic use, infant diet and birth mode are known to significantly affect infant microbiota. These exposures are also important risk factors for allergy and asthma in children. The impact of antibiotic-mediated microbiota disturbance is poorly understood because infants receiving antibiotics are often excluded from studies. This limits our ability to inform clinicians and parents about the consequences of treating infants with antibiotics.

Our goal is to systematically investigate the impact of antibiotic use, mode of delivery and diet on infant microbiota. We will employ the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) birth cohort study as a research platform. Antibiotic prescription use will be detailed from provincial database records. Mode of delivery will be extracted from hospital records. Maternal exposures during pregnancy and type of infant feeding will be obtained from parent report. Microbiota profiles will be generated via genetic analysis of infant fecal samples. We will employ statistical methods to test for the individual and combined effects of the following risk factors on microbiota diversity: antibiotic use (in mothers and infants), mode of delivery (vaginal or caesarean section), and infant diet (breast or formula-feeding).

In most Western countries, the rate of caesarean delivery is increasing, breastfeeding rates are lower than recommended, and almost two-thirds of infants will be prescribed an antibiotic by one year of age. Accumulating evidence suggests that these factors impact significantly on infant microbiota and subsequent development of allergy and asthma. Our research aims to provide evidence for a true causal relationship, with the potential to impact clinical practice guidelines in antibiotic use, breast feeding and caesarean section."

However, these studies had important methodological shortcomings limiting the interpretation of their results. Given the increasing use of antipsychotics, particularly for off-label indications and the risk of these potential adverse events, additional studies are need to investigate this association. Therefore, the objective of this study is to determine whether highly prolactin-elevating antipsychotics, when compared to mildly-elevating or prolactin-sparing antipsychotics, are associated with an increased risk of endometrial and ovarian cancer. This will be achieved by conducting a cohort study using the General Practice Research Database, a large primary care database from the United Kingdom. This database contains medical information on over 110,000 female patients who used antipsychotic agents between 1989 and 2009, followed until the end of 2011.

Although not all concordant, several observational studies have indicated that statins (drugs that improve lipid profiles) have anti-cancer properties and may thus reduce the risk of recurrence and mortality in men with prostate cancer. However, these studies had a number of important methodological shortcomings that limit the interpretation of their results. Thus, the objective of this study will be to determine whether statins decrease the risk of prostate cancer outcomes (recurrence, prostate cancer death, and all-cause mortality) in men with prostate cancer.

Cancer pharmacoepidemiology: a population-based assessment of the risks of prescription drugs in vulnerable populations,"['Azoulay, Laurent']","['Aprikian, Armen G', 'Boivin, Jean-François', 'Platt, Robert W', 'Pollak, Michael N']","['Cancer', 'Drug Safety', 'Electronic Patient Databases', 'Epidemiology', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Population Based', 'Public Health']",852701.0,313617,"Overarching focus of the research programCancer pharmacoepidemiology is emerging as an area of great interest in the medical community. With the increased use of prescription drugs across all ages, the long-term use of prescription drugs in the general population has reached unprecedented levels. While many of these drugs have been shown to have benefits in the short-term, the long-term effects are less certain. Indeed, there are concerns that some drugs may increase the risk of certain cancers. Furthermore, there are concerns that some cancer treatments themselves may be associated with important adverse events.My research program in cancer pharmacoepidemiology is specifically designed to address these concerns. To this end, my program will have three main objectives: 1) to assess whether commonly-prescribed drugs are associated with an increased risk of specific cancers, 2) to assess the safety of cancer treatments, and 3) to develop and apply innovative methods to deal with challenges in conducting cancer pharmacoepidemiologic studies. These objectives will be achieved by conducting large observational studies using comprehensive electronic patient databases and sophisticated pharmacoepidemiologic methods.Impact of the research programWhile trials are considered the gold standard for the assessment of drug efficacy, they are not suitable to assess cancer outcomes as safety endpoints. This is because patients with cancer are often excluded from trials, and cancer is a rare event developing over many years. Thus, the long-term effects of prescription drugs on the incidence of cancer are largely unknown when they enter the market. Similarly, trials of cancer treatments are not designed to assess uncommon yet important adverse events, mainly because of their smaller sample sizes and short durations of follow-up. Thus, there is a need for observational studies in the post-approval setting. With around 2 in 5 Canadians developing cancer in their lifetimes, and 1 in 4 will dying from the disease, it is a public health priority to minimize the risk that may be associated with prescription drugs.My research program will address important public health questions using rigorous pharmacoepidemiologic methodologies and will provide the concerned stakeholders with the necessary information to make informed decisions on the safety of prescription drugs.Core expertiseMy research program in cancer pharmacoepidemiology will include a team of highly-accomplished individuals with whom I have a successful history of collaboration. These individuals have extensive expertise in epidemiology, statistics and methodology, pathophysiology, as well as clinical experience. They include both senior and more junior individuals, and will bring together the necessary skills to successfully carry out this research program.Mentoring and training activitiesWith over 90% of my time protected for research, I am in a unique position to dedicate a good proportion of my time to mentoring and training students. I plan to supervise trainees at all levels, from the master’s to the post-doctoral level. I will also supervise short-term stages of medical residents interested in pharmacoepidemiologic research. Finally, as Program Director of Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology within the McGill Pharmacoepidemiology Research Unit, I am actively involved in organizing and moderating pharmacoepidemiology journal clubs at the Centre for Clinical Epidemiology, Jewish General Hospital."

What remains unclear are the mechanisms or pathways through which maternal distress can transcend to the fetus to influence child development; a potential pathway is through the methylation of genes in the placenta. What also remains unclear is whether past maternal trauma can also influence child mental health outcomes, beyond exposure to maternal prenatal distress.

During my Fellowship under the supervision of Dr. Monk at Columbia University Medical Center in New York, my aim is to expand my training in perinatal development to include skills such as: the assessment of fetal neurobehavior in utero, the extraction DNA from biospecimens, procedural knowledge to conduct observational studies, the development of treatment interventions, and proficiency in translational research. Overall, I aim to gain new knowledge to underscore the need for preventative healthcare and to inform specific, time-sensitive interventions to improve the mental health of women and their children in the first years of life."

We also know that most older people do not engage in much physical activity and spend a lot of time doing nothing, being sedentary. Understanding what helps and stops older people from being active is important when trying to develop ways to get them more active. Finally, we should try and develop a way of helping older individuals become more active and less sedentary and when we do this we should make sure that a number of different people (e.g., patients, health care professionals, policy makers, researchers) are involved in the process. As such, the goal of this international project is to use several different ways to create a way of understanding how much activity older people should be doing and develop a way to increase their activity."
Adaptation and development of an implementation strategy for a novel artificial intelligence-driven ehealth behaviour change program in Colombia,"['Bacon, Simon L']",['N/A'],"['Behavioural Medicine', 'Ehealth', 'Expandnet', 'Health Behaviour Change', 'Implementation']",262902.0,477582,"The burden of non-communicable chronic diseases (NCDs) is unequivocal. The root cause of most NCDs is a specific cluster of health risk behaviours, e.g., physical inactivity, poor diet, and smoking. Despite widespread knowledge of these risks, 43% of Colombians remain physically inactive, 28% report not meeting daily vegetables and fruits intake, and 12% smoke. Targeting behaviour change in individuals who are in early adulthood (e.g., 18-39) is important to reduce NCDs. However, promoting health behaviour change in this population has been a challenge. Our research team have created an artificial intelligence-driven ehealth behaviour change program (ACCELERATION) which has shown to be effective at changing behaviours and reducing NCD risk in Canada.

The main objectives of this application are to: 1) adapted the ACCELERATION program to the Colombian setting and test its implementation across the province of Antioquia; and 2) create a scale-up strategy for its implementation across Colombia.

To achieve these objectives, we will conduct a series of interconnected studies:
1) Use qualitative focus group and user experience (UX) methodologies to adapt ACCELERATION to the Colombian setting.
2) Conduct an implementation proof of concept study within the province of Antioquia to demonstrate effectiveness and evaluate practical aspects of scaling up across Colombia.
3) Undertake in-depth interviews with health administrators and policy makers to define the critical success factors for scaling-up ACCELERATION in Colombia.
4) Finally, we will incorporate all the information obtained above into the WHO ExpandNet framework to develop a scale-up strategy that can be used to implement ACCELERATION across Colombia and similar LMICs.

These studies will provide the basis to successfully implement ACCELERATION within Colombia, with an emphasis on benefitting more people on a lasting basis. We will also develop tools for the further scaling-up of ACCELERATION across similar LMICs."
"In sickness or in health? How well are the baby boomers aging compared to older generations: an analysis of age, period and cohort effects.","['Badley, Elizabeth M']","['Gignac, Monique A', 'Hogg-Johnson, Sheilah']","['Aging', 'Cohort Analysis', 'Functional Autonomy', 'Health Services', 'Policy', 'Population Health Survey', 'Restriciton Of Activity']",99967.0,231331,"The baby boomer generation is reaching retirement and the impact this will have on health services and policies relating to older people is unknown. While there will be large increases in the number of seniors as the baby boomers reach retirement, there are no consensus on whether baby boomers are or are not healthier than the preceding generation. If baby boomers are healthier the impact would be less than anticipated, and the converse if they are not.
We will carry out an epidemiological analysis of the longitudinal National Population Health Survey (NPHS) with data spanning 14 years. The overall goal of this research is to determine whether there are age, period or cohort effects in outcomes related to healthy and successful aging (restriction of activity, self-rated health), the maintenance of functional autonomy (dependence), and health care use (doctor visits) between the World War 2 cohort (born 1935-1944) and the older baby boomer cohorts (born 1945-1954) and between the older and younger (born 1955-1964) baby boomer cohorts. 
Using the rich data source of the longitudinal NPHS the proposed research will be the first to give insights into the complex balance of factors that might influence healthy aging, and fill a critical gap in our understanding as the baby boomer generation ages. This study will provide the first estimates of the health of the baby boomer cohorts balancing the effects of decreases in mortality due to advances in health care and education with potentially adverse changes in lifestyle such as increasing obesity. If the baby boomers are truly different, traditional approaches to planning services and policies for older people based on previous experience may be of limited value. This will be one of the first studies to systematically investigate the differential impact of a wide range of factors on outcomes related to healthy aging, dependence and health care use comparing different age cohorts in an aging population."
Impact of parents' sense of coherence on children's oral health status and related behaviors among newcomers in Edmonton,"['Badran, Courtenay']",['N/A'],"[""Children'S Oral Health"", 'Community', 'Decayed Missing Filled Teeth (Dmft/Dmft)', 'Dental Examination', 'Ics Studentship', 'Sense Of Coherence Scale', 'Statistics']",5000.0,348265,"ICS Studentship.

Higher rates of dental diseases and lower rates of dental visits have been shown among newcomers as compared to the general population. Newcomers often face more stressors in their daily life that could act as a barrier to adherence to preventive dental measures recommended for children. Therefore, their ability to cope with day-to-day tensions may play an important role in identifying and mobilizing resources to maintain their child's oral health. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of parents coping skills on children's oral health status and related behaviors among newcomer families. 

Ethics approval has been obtained for this community-based cross-sectional study. 160 pairs of children aged 2-12 years and parents who have lived in Canada for less than 10 years will be recruited through community programs run by Multicultural Health Brokers Co-op. Data will be collected by questionnaires and dental examinations using portable equipment facilitated by bilingual community health workers. Parent's coping abilities will be measured using the validated 13-item Sense of Coherence scale. The outcome variables will be child's caries experience (dmft/DMFT) and oral health-related behaviors (frequency of sugar intake, tooth brushing, and dental visits, and reasons for dental visit).

This community-based research project will increase our knowledge about the determinants of adherence to preventive oral health measures among newcomers. Parents will become more aware of their child's dental status and the importance of oral health for their children's well-being. Community health workers will have increased awareness of oral health care measures and capacity to do research in the field. Finally, health authorities will have enhanced capacity to design and implement oral health promotion initiatives based on identified needs, barriers, and enabling factors."
"Understanding the mechanisms and pathways linking adverse childhood experiences to non-suicidal self-injury among adolescents in mental health settings in Ontario, Canada: The mediating role of parental support and resilience","['Baiden, Philip']",['N/A'],"['Adverse Childhood Experiences', 'Mental Health', 'Non-Suicidal Self-Injury', 'Parental Support', 'Resilience']",90000.0,362592,"Non-suicidal self-injury by adolescents has attracted a lot of research attention over the last three decades. As many as 77% of adolescents with mental health problems engage in non-suicidal self-injury and these adolescents are in turn more likely to attempt suicide. Suicide is a serious public health concern and it ranks as the second leading cause of death among adolescents aged 10-24 years in Canada. Various studies have found that adverse childhood experiences (i.e., emotional, physical, and sexual abuse) are strongly related to many negative life outcomes including non-suicidal self-injury. However, few studies have investigated specific ways in which adverse childhood experiences contribute to engaging in non-suicidal self-injury. 

My research seeks to examine specific ways in which adverse childhood experiences contribute to non-suicidal self-injury using data from adolescents aged 10-18 years in inpatient mental health settings in Ontario. My research will also examine how parental support and resilience can help us understand the relationship between adverse childhood experiences and non-suicidal self-injury. Given the widespread nature of non-suicidal self-injury among adolescents and the devastating impact of suicide on society, my research findings will help clinicians, frontline staff, and families identify adolescents with a history of adverse childhood experiences who are more likely to engage in non-suicidal self-injury. Knowing this will allow for more specialized treatment approaches that directly target adolescents at risk for non-suicidal self-injury and even suicide. 

I will be working with Dr. Shannon Stewart at Western University, who is an internationally renowned scientist-practitioner in child and youth mental health. I will have access to a comprehensive dataset collected by Dr. Stewart to carry out my research to examine specific ways in which adverse childhood experiences contribute to non-suicidal self-injury."

They often experience professional interactions as intercultural encounters that are culturally unsafe for themselves and for the Indigenous peoples they serve. These situations tend to reify social conditions and practices that perpetuate the ill health of Indigenous peoples. On the other hand Indigenous professionals are also developing practice wisdom that enables them to resist these colonizing implications and to transform the events into opportunities for cultural liberation and enhanced wellbeing. Using an Indigenous and decolonizing methodology that draws on autoethnography, Indigenous story telling and memory work, the Indigenous researcher examined Indigenous research and professional social work praxis in-between Indigenous and Euro-western worldviews.  Intercultural encounters were examined using a critical incident technique the presenter developed called Decolonizing Critical Reflection. This method enabled participants to dig beneath the surface of their experiences in order to unearth the worldview influences on themselves and within the event. She found that as opposed to assuming hybrid identities, perspectives and practices, the research participants remained Indigenous-centered while interacting in-between worldviews. Their practices entailed interactive attempts to decolonize the situational dynamics and to facilitate cultural safety for themselves and other Indigenous players in the event. Practice wisdom for navigating in-between worldview professional situations was illuminated."

There is growing evidence to support the role of adverse factors before conception, during pregnancy and at early life, in the vulnerability to obesity. Reducing the risk of overweight and obesity (OWO) in the whole early life course can yield substantial benefits towards decreasing the population-wide burden of diseases associated to OWO. Our transdisciplinary Sino-Canadian team is conducting a community-based, multi-centre research study to test the impact of an evidence-based package of interventions on childhood OWO rates in 5-year-old children in China. A total of 36 community health centres, linked to 4 regional obstetric care hospitals, have been allocated at random into intervention or control (routine care) sites. The interventions account for the multi-faceted nature of early-life trajectories, are community-family-parent-child oriented, and are incorporated into the routine child care systems at pre-conception, prenatally and postnatally. We are examining the impact of the intervention on children's OWO rates, fat mass, indicators of metabolic dysfunction, child cerebral development/functioning, and modifiable parental or family risk factors for OWO (i.e., behaviours and parenting/caregiver practices). We are also studying some fundamental mechanisms that may underlie the development of OWO. We have reached 87% of the initial targeted recruitment (n=3,922) between January 2019 and October 31th, 2021. Our retention rate is 85% (n=3,327) and the participation rate for biobank samples so far surpasses 80%.

Although research has demonstrated a link between the built environment and PA, understanding this relationship from an Aboriginal perspective is important when considering health disparities between Aboriginal peoples and the general population. My Master's project is an ancillary study to an ongoing CIHR-funded project (2012-2015) that is evaluating Active Circle programming and its effect on positive youth development. As part of the Active Circle project, photovoice will be used to understand how youth from 10 urban and rural communities perceive the quality of PA opportunities in their community. Photovoice is a participatory research method that engages participants to take pictures of their community in a way that allows them to share personally meaningful dialogue about community issues. For my project, I will use the Rural Active Living Assessment (RALA), an established built environment assessment tool, to assess the physical environment in rural Aboriginal communities (about 4-5 communities) participating in the Active Circle study. The RALA assesses physical environment features that affect PA in rural communities. I will conduct a quantitative analysis of RALA outcomes and use the photovoice results to determine what elements are missing for understanding the built environment and its effect on PA from an Aboriginal perspective. The revised tool will then be validated within the Active Circle project. The results of my study will increase our understanding of the relationship between the built environment and PA. This will help reduce health disparities, such as higher rates of type II diabetes, among Aboriginal peoples. My project will also provide practitioners with a tool to assess the built environment of Aboriginal communities in a culturally meaningful way."

In 2011, Little Saskatchewan First Nation (LSFN) experienced an emergency evacuation due to a human-made flood. To date, 200 of 700 on-reserve members remain displaced and dispersed in hotels or temporary housing in the City of Winnipeg. Anecdotal reports about the health impacts of ID have emerged with an increased incidence of premature deaths, suicides, miscarriages, mental health disorders, youth involvement in gangs, marital break-ups, along with worsening of chronic illnesses. A detailed understanding of LSFN community members' experiences of ID is warranted to ensure the best interests of First Nations (FN) are protected and promoted by the Canadian health care system. An examination of the health outcomes of ID will generate recommendations for appropriate policies, programs and procedures to promote health and mitigate the negative outcomes of ID.  This paper will increase the understanding of the experiences and health outcomes of ID as perceived by LSFN elders. The objectives of this paper is to: (1) describe LSFN elders experiences of ID; (2) determine LSFN elders' needs and experiences of health and social services in the context of ID; and (3) examine the policies that shape the historical, social, political, economic and cultural context that determine LSFN elders' health resiliency. Participants were recruited based on their ID experience, age status and residence. The health outcomes of ID were systematically documented and a video produced. The significance of this paper is to share knowledge of the health outcomes of ID among LSFN community members as important work as well as a characterization of needs."

The natural hormone changes that occur during menopause are associated with weight gain, changes in the distribution of body fat, and loss of lean muscle mass. Over one third (34.7%) of postmenopausal women are currently obese. Hormone therapy is often prescribed to women to manage the physical symptoms (e.g., hot flashes, migraine) that occur during and after menopause. However, our understanding of the effects of excess body weight (obesity) and hormone therapy in postmenopausal women remains incomplete. The primary aim of this project is to study the relationship between obesity and hormone therapy in older women. A secondary objective is to develop more accurate indicators of obesity in postmenopausal women.

For this project, I will be using data from nearly 30,000 postmenopausal women who participated in the Women's Health Initiative clinical trial. Women were randomly assigned to receive either hormone therapy or placebo pill. I will use advanced statistical methods to examine whether hormone therapy and obesity interact to increase the risk of heart disease in postmenopausal women. I will also make use of innovative technology for measuring obesity from dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scans and compare these results to standard tools for measuring body weight.

The results of this research have great public health significance. Understanding how obesity and hormone therapy affect the risk of heart disease will help inform treatment guidelines and enable scientists to develop intervention programs specifically targeting postmenopausal women. These results will contribute to our understanding of healthy aging in postmenopausal women and be used to develop strategies to improve women's health outcomes."

Forty multi-stakeholders working in health equity were interviewed across Canada and participated in a series of community dialogues from November 2022 to April 2023 on how to overcome the ongoing and rising public health disparities experienced in South Asian communities. SAAOP raised concerns about the long-standing history of South Asian communities of being over-researched ""on"" them, often through questionable research practices, minimal community engagement, lack of transparency and having little benefit. Such generated knowledge needs to be communicated among to healthcare institutions, research organizations and tri-agency funding programs to build accountability, ownership, and best practices in the research process to reduce South health inequities in Canada.

The majority of these preventable deaths (89%) have occurred in housing environments such as single room occupancy hotels and emergency shelters. In Vancouver, there has been an increase in overdose response interventions such as overdose prevention sites and naloxone distribution; however, the public health response within housing environments specifically has been challenging due to a range of contextual factors that have impeded the effective implementation of overdose response interventions. Through a qualitative and ethnographic approach, this study will examine the influence of physical (e.g., building conditions, geographical distribution of services), social (e.g., stigma, discrimination), and structural (e.g., policies, programs) factors that impact overdose risk, as well as the use and outcomes of overdose response interventions within housing environments by people who use drugs (PWUD). This work will also seek to identify policy and programmatic priorities to improve the health outcomes of PWUD, including the reduction of overdose risk and mortality.

There has been a recent shift in understanding drug use as a health issue. Studies have also demonstrated the harms associated with criminalizing drugs. As a result, several community stakeholders, including police, politicians, academics, and grassroots organizations alike, have been calling for policy changes to move away from criminalizing people who use drugs toward a health-focused approach. In the 1990s, Portugal decriminalized drug possession and saw health benefits at individual and population levels. In 2020, the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police recognized substance use as a public health issue and supported drug possession decriminalization. The federal government has not approved this approach nationally. However, some police services have deprioritized criminalizing drug possession. For example, the Waterloo Region Police Service had the seventh highest rate of opioid- related charges in Canada, but in the last 2 years it has reduced its simple possession charges by 50%. This demonstrates how police services are able to make policy and practice changes at a local level rather than seeking federal approval. This study seeks to understand the effects of policing on the health of people who use drugs, characterize Waterloo Region policing practices as they relate to decriminalization and health-related strategies, and examine changes in police approaches to drug possession and related outcomes across time. The overall goal of this study is to work collaboratively with Waterloo Regional Police Service and other community partners to inform policing policy and practice across Canada in ways that emphasize drug use as a health issue rather than a criminal one."

WHO suggests to ban or highly restrict its use in animals. In Indonesia, colistin resistance in human Escherichia coli isolates is poorly characterized as it requires specific non-routine tests. Detection of colistin resistance in E. coli in poultry resulted in a ban for livestock in Indonesia in 2020. However, no information is available on the effectiveness of this ban. Colistin is also suspected to be routinely used in humans in multiple settings but these practices are poorly understood. In this project, we propose to assess the effectiveness of the initial ban on colistin use in livestock in reducing colistin resistance in humans and animals, and further explore how a One Health perspective can strengthen this intervention. 
This project aims to: i) determine phenotypic and genotypic colistin resistance in E. coli from humans and poultry in Indonesia pre- and post-ban; ii) assess the impact of the colistin ban on resistance in E. coli in animals and humans; iii) estimate the transmission of colistin resistance between animals and humans; iv) study colistin use and their drivers at the community level; and v) expand the initial colistin ban in the animal production sector into an integrative multi-sectorial One Health intervention, which will be designed and implemented using a community-based participatory approach. This project will provide a strong scientific basis to AMR policies in Indonesia, with great significance across Southeast Asia."

"The role of women-centered care and peer support for women living with HIV (WLWH) in Metro Vancouver, Canada","['Barreto, Daniella F']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2500.0,347121,"Women constitute a growing number of HIV cases globally and in Canada. Gender inequity is manifest in the barriers to services women experience such as structural and interpersonal violence, stigma and care models that cater to men. Particularly vulnerable groups including Indigenous women, sex workers and youth (<30) may also have intersecting barriers to HIV care from testing to treatment. There is evidence to suggest that peer support programs have shown increased participation in HIV care in certain contexts among sex workers and hard-to-reach populations. The objective of this research is to assess the need for women-centered HIV care and peer support for a broader group of WLWH. 
Cross-sectional data was drawn from the December 2015 baseline results of ""Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS: Women's Longitudinal Needs Assessment"" (SHAWNA), a prospective collaborative project for WLWH. The major aim of this study is to analyze the gaps in care over time for WLWH. Trained interviewers and nurses administer baseline and bi-annual follow-up questionnaires to WLWH. Of 160 women who are currently enrolled in the study and living with HIV, 60.6% (n=97) identify as having Indigenous ancestry of First Nations, Inuit or Metis, 31.3% (n=50) identify as being a gender or sexual minority and 83.8% (n=134) had ever exchanged sex for money or resources. Almost a quarter, 74.4% (n=119) reported it is important to see other women in the waiting room of an HIV clinic, 51.9% (n=83) reported that it was important to have peer support available at the clinic, and 54.7% (n=87) reported that peer support for people of the same culture was an important element of an HIV clinic. These preliminary results suggest that women-centered care with peer support is a necessary component of HIV care for WLWH. This may increase women's safety from being less likely to encounter gender-based violence or discrimination, and it may decrease the stigma experienced in care settings when a peer is present."
Let's Talk Ticks: Knowledge translation of protective practices against ticks and tick-borne diseases,"['Bartlett, Karen H']","['Blewett, Caitlin M', 'Henry, Bonnie J', 'Nicol, Anne-Marie']","['Children', 'Communication', 'Disease Prevention', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Ticks']",24000.0,243815,"Lets Talk Ticks in an innovative program targeting young children in an entertaining and memorable format. Ticks carry a variety of serious human diseases like Lyme disease that can cause significant illness. Tick habitats across Canada, including BC's Lower Mainland, are changing in conjunction with the changing climate. The Lets Talk Ticks program was designed by a team of educators, animators and public health researchers to introduce school-aged children to tick physiology, habitat and removal. The program includes a short cartoon that covers the basics, such as how ticks come into contact with humans and pets, how tick bites can be avoided and what to do if you find a tick on you. The cartoon was created for children in primary grades. A curriculum expert designed a corresponding set of six mini-lessons with learning objectives, activities and evaluation materials. Over the summer of 2011, trained instructors piloted the ""Lets Talk Ticks"" program in 13 Vancouver summer camps. Based on observational evaluation and staff feedback, the pilot project was very well received; children strongly identified with the story and characters, and demonstrated excellent retention regarding tick awareness. The program has also been translated into Punjabi, English and Cantonese to reflect the cultural diversity of the Lower Mainland. The research team is seeking funding to expand the program into more areas where ticks are an emerging or epidemic issue. School boards the Lower Mainland will be approached first to determine how best to integrate the program into the primary curriculum. Based on the results of this first step, the program will then be offered for free to other school boards and summer camps in areas that the Public Health Agency of Canada has identified as regions of concern for tick infestations. Funding for this project will support the outreach team, cover the expenses of travel and maintain the website where the program can be easily accessed."
Effect of a Smartphone Intervention on Quitting Smoking in a Young Adult Population of Smokers: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"['Baskerville, Neill B', 'Hammond, David G']","['Brown, K.

The economic impact of tobacco related illness in Canada is also significant, with an estimated 2.2 million acute hospital stays and $4.4 billion in direct health care costs. Young adults have the highest smoking prevalence (23%) & 69% of young adult cell phone users are smartphone subscribers.
While current evidence supports the effectiveness of text messaging for smoking cessation, to date no controlled trials have been done on the use of smartphone cessation apps. Smartphones provide greater functionality than mobile phones. The interactive nature of smartphones & their ability to integrate information, motivational techniques, links to support networks & collect real-time data is promising for smoking cessation. An in-depth look at existing quit smoking apps found that none were based on clinical practice guidelines for tobacco; therefore, were less likely to be effective. To address this gap, investigators developed an evidence-informed smoking cessation app that has been piloted with over 300 smokers.
This study will be the first to examine a smartphone smoking cessation app for young adult smokers using a randomized controlled trial. The primary aim will be to determine the effectiveness of the app on quitting smoking. Secondary aims of this study include examining: 1) proximal outcome measures of cessation behaviour; 2) satisfaction, extent of app use, and use of NRT and other cessation services; 3) mediators of cessation outcomes between conditions; and 4) the incremental cost-effectiveness.  A usual-care, self-help guide will act as the control condition.
The long-term potential of an effective smartphone-based innovation to reduce tobacco use will impact government health care spending & save the young adult population from the morbidity and mortality associated with smoking, improving the overall population health of Canadians in the process."

Through dynamic, activity-based facilitation, they will interface with panelists from Ecuador and Canada who have experience promoting nutrition and healthy food systems through participatory action research, popular education, social marketing and community-based media. The panelists visiting from Ecuador will draw from their experiences engaging directly with Canadian-led nutrition research. They are: Luzmila Vásquez, agroecological farmer and Indigenous Kichwa leader; Eliana Estrella, radio host-turned-food-advocate and community researcher; and, Eduar Pinzón, farmer, community researcher and president of the National Agroecology Collective. Canadian panelist Rosanne Blanchet will speak from her experience as a public health researcher, conducting participatory research around food with First Nations in the Okanagan and with seasonal migrant workers in Quebec. Collectively, the panelists have worked closely around food, nutrition and food sovereignty with Indigenous people in Ecuador and Canada, peasant farmers, under-served urban communities, migrant laborers and immigrants. Together, panelists will share and reflect on pragmatic lessons from their experiences for effective promotion of nutrition in these diverse communities. The Café is designed to be accessible to a general public, with engaging, plain-language discussion. Dynamic facilitation will involve both moderated panelist discussion and intimate, small-group conversations in which participants can get to know each panelist. The Café is organized and moderated by Malek Batal and Ana Deaconu, both from the Nutrition Department at Université de Montréal. The event will be trilingual, in Spanish, French and English."
Road traffic speed and volume profiles of collision hotspots in the City of Toronto,"['Batomen Kuimi, Brice Lionel', 'Howard, Andrew W', 'Rothman, Linda']","['Brown, Patrick E', 'Macpherson, Alison', 'Siddiqi, Arjumand']","['Active Transportation', 'Big Data', 'Injury Prevention', 'Road Safety', 'Vulnerable Road Users']",263925.0,489155,"Traffic collisions are a leading cause of premature death; and injuries caused by collisions represent a preventable burden to the health care system. Maintaining a sustainable and safe road system in cities is a critical challenge. Traffic volume and speed are well-established determinants of road safety, with speed being the most important modifiable risk factor. Yet, they are not often measured in road safety intervention evaluations due to data limitations. Specifically, Canadian cities lack granular traffic speed and volume data by road user type.
This proposal aims to document motorized vehicle speed and traffic volume profiles in Toronto using innovative data collection, and linkage and advanced epidemiological methods to assess their relationship to traffic injuries.
Data sources span ten years from 2012 to 2022 and include: (a) collision injuries from Transportation Services of the City of Toronto, (b) speed and volume data from Automatic Speed Camera records, through existing collaborations with the city and a unique new collaboration with TYLin (a global engineering firm dedicated to advancing urban mobility through big data), (c) socio-demographic indicators from Statistics Canada census data, (d) spatial data related to other relevant road safety determinants (e.g., traffic calming, land use) from the city open data portal. Bayesian spatial-temporal analyses as well as case-crossover designs will be leveraged to define what speed profiles are dangerous for specific road users and estimate the proportion of traffic injuries preventable by targeted efforts to control vehicle speeds. Social equity concerns will be paramount, to ensure preventive efforts target neighbourhoods and populations at risk.
An understanding of traffic speed and volume profiles could guide evidence-based initiatives for a safe sustainable transportation. Key knowledge users, including the City of Toronto and Parachute, a national injury prevention charity, will participate."

Trans PULSE Canada aims to describe and compare health outcomes and access to care for trans people across provinces/territories and within four priority population subgroups: those who are Indigenous, sex workers, immigrants, and/or those who identify as gender non-binary. In addition, we will make comparisons to Ontario's 2009-2010 trans population, as well as to the general population from Statistics Canada data. Grounded in community-based research (CBR) processes, we will conduct a development process that will both shape the priority population sections of the survey and launch a companion Indigenous gender diversity grant. We will conduct a national survey of 3000 trans people. We will then undertake an intensive knowledge translation phase. All Canadian residents 16 and older whose gender identity does not match their sex assigned at birth will be eligible to complete a 'long form' survey or, if unwilling or unable, to choose a 'short form'. Both will span all content areas, with the short form prioritizing key items. The survey (in English or French) will be accessed online or on paper, and can be completed by phone with an interpreter in another language if needed. In ten cities, peer workers will also visit community organizations with electronic tablets, collecting data from trans people who are homeless, street-involved, and/or sex workers. Trans PULSE Canada uses a CBR approach, with a trans-majority research team, an Indigenous Leadership Group, and Priority Population Consultation Teams. The project is led by a pan-Canadian team of academic, community, service provider, and policy partners, and uses an integrated and responsive knowledge translation process."

The overarching goal of the proposed program is to strengthen the methods that epidemiologists and other researchers use to study health, by better incorporating a sex- and gender-based analysis plus (SGBA+) approach. SGBA+ means we always consider not just sex/gender differences in health or the factors that promote or hinder good health, but that we do two additional things: 1) clearly incorporate diversity of biological sex characteristics and social gender characteristics that can affect health through very different pathways (the ""SG"" part of SGBA+), and 2) use methods that allow for sex and gender to have different effects or impacts among groups of people of varying identities or social positions, e.g., ages, socioeconomic statuses, ethnoracial backgrounds, sexual orientations (the ""+"" part of SGBA+). As researchers, we have not been very good at doing these two things in our work. The proposed program of research and knowledge translation provides vital information that researchers need to improve their capacity for SGBA+, including: 1) understanding dimensions of sex or gender and their perform as substitutes (proxies) for the dimension(s) researchers believe are most relevant for particular health issues; 2) identifying the statistical methods currently used in intersectional research, how well they reflect intersectionality theoretical frameworks, and how best practices might be applied in Canadian data. This research will inform development of academic research papers, an Online SGBA+ Methods Toolkit, SGBA+ Methods Workshops at conferences. It will also inform curriculum for a Summer Training Intensive in Intersectionality Research in conjunction with the recently-chartered Intersectionality Training Institute in Washington DC. Together, these research and training initiatives serve to build capacity for SGBA+ in epidemiology."
Family-Making: Contemporary Ethical Challenges,"['Baylis, Françoise']",['N/A'],"['Adoption', 'Assisted Human Reproduction', 'Ethics']",20000.0,245970,"In North America, 8% to 12% of couples experience infertility. A subset of these couples seek medical assistance to conceive, others pursue adoption (with or without having first tried assisted human reproduction), and still others choose (or accept) child-free living. In addition, assisted human reproduction and adoption are options for single people and people in non-heterosexual relationships where neither partner is infertile. Choosing between the contemporary options of having children through assisted reproduction or through adoption can be ethically very difficult.

The ethical issues that arise in making the above choice are the subject of a book project ""Family-making: Contemporary Ethical Challenges"" with chapters authored by 17 internationally renowned scholars, six of whom are Canadian. The book editors are Françoise Baylis and Carolyn McLeod (both of whom are CIHR-funded researchers). A book contract has been signed with Oxford University Press, the terms of which include a meeting of all authors to evaluate draft manuscripts.

The collaborative writing process for the book is as follows. All contributors will submit draft chapters to the editors in January 2012. These drafts will be pre-circulated to all contributors who will attend a face-to-face meeting in Halifax April 25-27, 2012. Authors will revise their chapters in light of the discussions. Next, the book editors and two other contributors will review revised chapters. A final book manuscript will be submitted to the publisher in the Fall of 2012.
 
Consistent with CIHR objectives for dissemination events, the planned workshop will facilitate ""dissemination and/or discussion of research findings"" and the planned deliverable (i.e., the book with OUP) will contribute to the ""education of patients, health professionals, policy-makers, and the general public"".

Transformational Teaching and Adolescent Physical Activity Promotion: Adolescence In Motion (AIM) Trial.,"['Beauchamp, Mark R']","['Barling, julian I', 'Bruner, Mark W', 'Masse, Louise C', 'Shields, Christopher A']","['Feasibility Trial', 'Physical Activity Adoption And Maintenance', 'Psychological Intervention', 'School-Based Study', 'Social Cognition']",180684.0,202002,"Physical inactivity in adolescence has been linked to a vast array of physical and mental health problems. In schools across Canada adolescents are required to undertake physical education, and are potentially exposed to a range of activities (e.g., recreational and competitive sport) that can be pursued outside of the school environment and into adulthood. Indeed, from a health promotion perspective, physical education teachers are ideally placed to make a lasting impression on young people to help them engage in lifelong physical activity participation. However, the fact remains that in Canada 90% of teenagers are not sufficiently active to meet international guidelines for optimal growth and development.  The purpose of the proposed research is to apply an innovative framework of teaching that draws from transformational leadership theory, to enhance the physical activity behaviors of Canadian adolescents. Recent research suggests that transformational teaching (a) is associated with a range of adaptive social cognitions and physical activity behaviours among adolescents, and (b) can be developed through intervention. In the proposed research we present a transformational teaching intervention, and test the efficacy of this intervention through use of a randomized controlled trial. The research will examine the relationships between transformational teaching and physical activity behaviours displayed by adolescents (primary outcome). The research will also look to examine two key psychological mechanisms (self-efficacy and self-determined motivation) that might explain how transformational teaching influences adolescent physical activity (secondary outcomes). Should empirical support be found for the predictive utility of the transformational teaching construct, it is anticipated that the proposed program of research will be used to inform future evidence-based initiatives to inspire a greater proportion of adolescents to become and stay physically active."

De nos jours, il est de plus en plus courant de recourir à des mesures intermédiaires d'efficacité au lieu d'une mesure finale afin d'estimer l'efficacité d'un nouvel agent anticancéreux. Ainsi, les évaluations économiques de ces traitements reposent souvent sur le rapport entre le coût et une mesure intermédiaire d'efficacité telle que la survie sans progression. Par contre, l'absence de résultats cliniques finaux comme la survie globale complexifie la prise de décision, puisque d'un point de vue coût efficacité, il peut être difficile d'établir la valeur d'une année de vie sans progression. À cet effet, l'objectif principal de ce projet de recherche consiste à établir une relation entre la survie sans progression et la survie globale chez les femmes atteintes d'un cancer du sein métastatique, ce qui permettra de prédire la survie globale résultant d'une estimation de survie sans progression. Plus spécifiquement, les objectifs de ce projet sont, d'une part, d'établir une relation entre la survie globale et la survie sans progression et d'identifier les facteurs déterminants d'une relation significative et, d'autre part, de développer un modèle fournissant une estimation de la survie globale plus près de la réalité en tenant compte, entre autres, de l'observance aux traitements.

Understanding and Responding to HIV Vulnerability Among Disadvantaged Populations in Canada and Globally: A Program Science Research Agenda,"['Becker, Marissa']",['N/A'],"['Canada', 'Global Public Health', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Population Health', 'Prevention', 'Treatment', 'Vulnerable']",300000.0,302030,"HIV is a major public health problem. Since the start of the HIV epidemic, there have been over 30 million people infected with HIV and 30 million related deaths. In Canada, 71,000 people are estimated to be living with HIV. 

My research aims to identify and respond to gaps in the HIV prevention and treatment continuum, using a Program Science framework. Although developing and developed countries are different, the underlying drivers of the HIV epidemics are similar, as are the vulnerabilities faced by marginalized populations. As well, lessons learned in either setting can benefit each other. 

I have three central projects in my research agenda: Study 1 aims to understand the HIV risk and vulnerability faced by young women as they transition into sex work in Kenya, Ukraine and India. Female sex workers (FSWs) experience a much higher risk of HIV than the general population, and programs targeted to FSWs are a critical component of HIV prevention. The goal of this research is to estimate HIV risk, and characterize the behaviours that influence this risk, during the transition period from first sex until self-declared entry into sex work and during the early period of sex work. The findings will contribute significantly to our understanding of HIV risk and will inform the strategic design of HIV prevention programs. 

Studies 2 and 3 of my research plan focus on HIV care outcomes. These studies establish cohorts and use a combination of clinical and provincial health care data in Manitoba. Study 2 aims to identify where there have been missed opportunities for earlier diagnosis of HIV. This will identify where to expand testing options in order to ensure earlier diagnosis and linkage to care. Study 3 builds on this with the development of a prospective cohort of HIV positive persons across Canada to understand health care patterns and explore models of HIV care. Through these cohorts, we will better understand the health care needs of this vulnerable population."

Evidence suggests that young women may also exchange sex for money, drugs, or gifts (undeclared transactional sex) prior to identifying as a sex worker. The goal of this research project is to (i) estimate HIV risk, and characterize the behaviours (such as undeclared transactional sex) that influence HIV risk, during the transition period from first sex until self-declared entry into sex work; (ii) estimate HIV risk during the first two years of ""formal"" sex work, if before access to local HIV prevention services (access gap); and (iii) explore the importance of this early HIV risk for epidemic control. We will use innovative geographic mapping tools and perform a cross-sectional biological and behavioural survey of young women residing in established sex work ""hot spots"" in south India, Kenya, and Ukraine. Mathematical modelling will use these data to replicate diverse HIV epidemics in each of the three study sites, to understand how HIV infection acquired before ""formal"" entry into sex work or during the access gap could potentially limit the ability of existing programs to protect FSWs and the general population from HIV, and to estimate the added benefit of feasibly expanding existing programs to prevent these early HIV infections. The findings will contribute significantly to our understanding of HIV risk in young, high-risk women and self-identified FSWs, and will inform the strategic design and expansion of HIV prevention programs in regions where ""formal"" sex work and undeclared transactional sex fuel and sustain HIV epidemics."

This work will generate contextualized knowledge for prioritizing place-based strategies to optimize STBBI prevention program coverage and address unmet needs. We will use complementary methods, combining primary quantitative (programmatic mapping, venue profiling, and cross-sectional surveys) and qualitative (peer ethnography and field notes) data collection to examine the interconnections between place (Obj 1), people (Obj 2) and programs (Obj 3) that shape ecologies of risk and safety. Data from the three objectives will be integrated and synthesized to collectively address our aim. Building upon well-established prevention programs for key populations in Nairobi County, this research will generate new knowledge to inform the adaptation of existing programs to incorporate place-based strategies for STBBI prevention among AGYW, FSW, and men. Reframing programmatic approaches to prioritization to focus on place, rather than individual identities, will be a critical step in improving STBBI-related health outcomes for those most vulnerable and to reduce health inequities at the population level."

Yet, little data exists to inform the response in conflict settings. In order to better understand how conflict affects the organization of sex work and HIV and HCV risk, we received CIHR funding to undertake a study entitled ""The impact of political conflict on the dynamics of sex work and the HIV/STI and HCV epidemic in Ukraine"" (Dynamics Study). The ongoing study (2016-2021) is exploring HIV/STI and HCV risk and prevalence among sex workers and their clients in Dnipro, Eastern Ukraine. Building on our work on the Dynamics Study, we have been approached by the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine to conduct a study among their personnel to understand how the conflict has impacted HIV/HCV rates, as they are observing increases in HIV notification rates since the beginning of the conflict. HIV and HCV risk behaviours and prevalence remain generally unknown and underreported due to a lack of routine HIV screening and a lack of epidemiological investigation. We propose to hold a 3-day planning meeting in Kiev, Ukraine to bring together our multi-disciplinary team along with local Ukraine government officials to collaboratively develop a CIHR Project Grant proposal and a plan for moving forward with this important research project."

Amidst this backdrop, Ukraine has had growing HIV and HCV epidemics. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine may exacerbate these sexually transmitted and blood-borne infection (STBBI) epidemics-including HIV, HCV, and other STI. Conflict and its consequences-including population movement, disruption in the health care system and economic impact-have the potential to undermine epidemic control. Important changes in the HIV epidemic have already been seen in this conflict. The Ministry of Defense reports increased HIV among military personnel since 2014, and evidence indicates movement of HIV viral lineages out the conflict zone to other parts of the country, following the movement of internally displaced persons. Conflict's impact on transmission dynamics of non-HIV STBBI is under-researched, but given common risk factors for transmission, is important to examine. Many factors within the military environment might contribute to risks of STBBI acquisition and transmission. Young age, consistent income, high risk-tolerance, exposure to trauma, deployment away from home and limited access to health services, tend to place military personnel at higher risk for STBBI. As such, there is a particular need to quantify STBBI burden among military personnel, identify missed opportunities in prevention and treatment, and explore how this unique population might contribute to broader transmission dynamics in the country. With our multidisciplinary team, including colleagues from the Ukrainian Institute for Social Research and the Ministries of Defense and Health, we aim to understand the burden of STBBI among military personnel in the setting of conflict and to examine the extent to which unmet prevention needs of military personnel contribute and sustain STBBI epidemics in Ukraine."
The Effectiveness of a Motor and Pre-literacy Community-based Program in Preschool Aged Children,"['Bedard, Chloe T']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awads'],1353.0,352439,"This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a movement and pre-literacy program designed for children ages 3 to 4 years in Hamilton, Ontario. The program ran for 1 hour/week for 10 consecutive weeks and consisted of three components: direct FMS instruction, unstructured exploratory free-play, and a dialogic storybook reading activity. There was active involvement of at least one parent or caregiver in the direct instruction and reading components.  Families were recruited from local community agencies and were asked to attend at least two study appointments ten weeks apart. Half of the families entered into the program after the first appointment (the experimental group) and the remaining families entered the program after their second appointment (the wait-list control group). Children were assessed using the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales - 2nd edition, the Preschool Word and Print Awareness Test, and the Phonological Awareness Literacy Screening: Preschool Uppercase alphabet knowledge test. Parents were also asked to complete questionnaires asking about various demographic characteristics and the frequency in which they engage in movement and pre-literacy activities at home with their children. The results of the evaluation show that both groups improved their gross motor skills, word and print awareness, and alphabet knowledge. Children in the experimental group showed statistically significant greater improvements compared to children in the wait-list control group in gross motor skills and word and print awareness. Improvements in alphabet knowledge, and parental engagement scores did not differ significantly between groups. The implications of these results are substantial because they provide evidence that participation in a community-based program offering direct instruction in a fun and family-oriented environment has the potential to improve the movement and pre-literacy skills of preschool age children."

Unfortunately, these health risks present in early childhood impact health and behaviour throughout the lifecourse, from adolescence through to older adulthood. Given the high prevalence of these health risks in young children, we can conclude that substantial improvements need to be made in order to enhance the health and development of children over time. Emerging research from education, neurobiology, and exercise psychology links strong development of physical activity, cognitive abilities, social skills, and positive self-perceptions to proficiency in movement. Therefore it is hypothesized that early intervention to strengthen movement skills may help to curb the concerning rates of poor school readiness, inactivity, obesity, and subsequently positively impact health across the lifespan. Thus, the primary aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of a movement-based program on the physical, cognitive, social, and psychological development of 3 to 5 year old children. Community centres in Hamilton, Ontario will be randomly assigned to either receive training on the 10-week program or be placed in a wait-list control group. Changes in children's BMI, motor skills, social behaviours, cognitive skills, self-perceptions, and daily physical activity will be assessed over a one year period. It is hypothesized that children in the program will show greater improvement in all developmental and health outcomes over time compared to children in the wait-list control group. With advanced knowledge regarding how well this program works, we can begin implementation efforts in other communities. The ultimate goal for this project is to be able to provide communities and families with the knowledge and skills to support their children's development and health."

Prospective memory functioning following traumatic brain injury: Vulnerability to mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease,"['Bedard, Marc']",['N/A'],"[""Alzheimer'S Disease"", 'Canadian Longitudinal Study On Aging', 'Mild Cognitive Impairment', 'Prospective Memory', 'Traumatic Brain Injury']",150000.0,361981,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is defined as a set of cognitive deficits that do not yet meet criteria for dementia. However, patients who meet the diagnostic criteria for MCI may progress to dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, at a much greater rate than the general older population of Canadians above the age of 60 (26% vs. 3%, over a three-year period). To facilitate early identification and treatment of those who may be at greater risk of MCI and Alzheimer's, it is essential to understand the nature of cognitive deficits that may be implicated, particularly among those who may be more predisposed to developing dementia.
For instance, traumatic brain injuries are commonly reported by older individuals and have been shown to contribute to the development of MCI and Alzheimer's disease. Prospective memory, which refers to memory for future planned actions, such as taking medication at a specific time, has been shown to be disrupted among survivors of traumatic brain injuries, but also among those with MCI and Alzheimer's. In fact, this relationship has been so frequently found that prospective memory impairments have been suggested to be an early clinical indicator of Alzheimer's disease.  
The proposed research therefore has several important aims: 1) to better understand the nature of prospective memory deficits among survivors of traumatic brain injuries; 2) to investigate whether prospective memory performance, following traumatic brain injuries, may better identify those with MCI and Alzheimer's disease; and 3) to determine whether prospective memory performance and previous traumatic brain injury may predict further cognitive decline, including MCI and Alzheimer's diagnoses over a three-year follow-up period. Using data collected from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, this study will allow for the better understanding of those who are at greater risk of developing dementia following traumatic brain injuries, to better inform early interventions."

Aging has been associated with declines in cognitive capacity, vision and physical abilities that may impair one's ability to drive safely. However, we know that older adults should not have their driving licenses revoked simply on the basis of age or an age-related medical diagnosis; many are still safe to drive. To ensure the well-being of older adults while at the same time maintaining public safety, we need to find fair and equitable means to ensure that no one is deprived of the driving privilege unjustly. Canadian Driving Research Initiative for Vehicular Safety in the Elderly (Candrive), funded by CIHR, was developed to do just that. It is a national longitudinal study involving seven sites and over 900 older drivers to generate knowledge for use by transportation policy makers, clinicians and the general public to improve the safety and quality-of-life of older drivers in Canada.

The Québec government launched in 2006 an action plan (PAG) to promote healthy eating and regular physical activity, and to prevent weight-related problems among Quebecers. One of the priorities of the PAG is to improve health services offered to individuals with weight-related problems. However, the development and implementation of sustainable weight-related strategies remains a challenge, since a majority of individuals regain weight lost over time. In response to the need of an alternative approach (that is not strictly dieting), ""Health-At-Every-Size"" interventions, which are mainly focusing on health rather that weight, have been proposed as an effective strategy for individuals with weight-related problems who are constantly seeking for help to better manage their weight. Accordingly, the ""Choisir de Maigrir?"" program is one of the actions identified in the PAG as a community-based intervention to improve health services among women. Within the context of its massive dissemination among health and social service centres (CSSS) of Québec, it is essential to develop a population-based understanding of the effectiveness of the ""Choisir de Maigrir?"" program in Quebec's CSSS by documenting (1) the acceptability of the program (2) the quality of the implementation process (conditions of delivery) and (3) the effects of the program on women's health (healthy eating, active living, well-being, weight) in a natural setting. Because of the urgent need to help individuals struggling with weight-related problems in a healthy and sustainable way, this innovative research program will contribute to new scientific knowledge on weight management, and will also encourage tight collaborations an knowledge exchange between researchers, non-profit organizations and public partners."
Analyzing the significance of policies that restrict men who have sex with men (MSM) as eligible donors of human biological materials for transplantation and assisted reproduction,"['Behrmann, Jason']",['N/A'],"['And Cell Donation', 'Bioethics', 'Health Policy', 'Lgbt Community', 'Men Who Have Sex With Men', 'Organ', 'Policy Development', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Analysis', 'Social Justice', 'Stigmatization', 'Tissue']",135000.0,224760,"Biomedical innovation has made human organs, tissues, and cells valuable tools in treating a variety of diseases, ranging from cancer to infertility. However, as human biological materials grow in medical importance, the supply of many of these materials remains severely limited, making donor eligibility criteria an important issue for analysis and debate. This post-doctoral project will analyze North American policies that ban all sexually active gay and bisexual men from being eligible donors of human biological materials for transplantation and assisted reproduction. Analysis will centre on issues of social justice and stigmatization in public health policy development. While MSM donor bans have created much media attention in the past, to date, few academic publications have analyzed the political and ethical legitimacy, or the social and public health ramifications of these regulations. The proposed post-doctoral project aims to remedy this deficiency in academic knowledge. This project will involve an ethics and policy analysis of regulatory documents. Critiques and assessment of these regulations will develop from a literature review of biomedical publications concerning organ and tissue transplantation, transmission and screening methods for viral pathogens, and biomedical application of human materials in medicine and research. The final aim of this research is to provide a knowledge foundation to draft new donor eligibility guidelines that are both ethically sound and best serve the health and well-being of patients in need of a transplant."

Relationships between health care providers and patients have been traditionally characterised by power and knowledge inequalities, and dominated by paternalism in Western societies. However, with the increase in accessibility of medical information and the ethical principles of patient autonomy and informed consent, patient-provider interactions are slowly becoming more egalitarian. Shared decision-making is a recent approach that generally involves elucidating and respecting patients' preferences for participation in the decision-making process. The question that guides this investigation is: How do patients, their families, and health care providers construct decision-making about palliative care options through their discourse? Discourse refers to the verbal and non-verbal communication that constitutes our social interactions. The study consists of a nine-month period of observation of decision-making in a palliative care unit, following approximately 20 patients with terminal illnesses as they are being cared for by an interdisciplinary team. The focus is on communication and the way professionals, patients, and family members talk about the decisions that have to be made, and how that influences their participation in the decision-making process. Specifically, the way power is expressed through talk will be explored, for example finding out which ways of talking to patients tend to encourage them to express their preferences and participate in decision-making. By helping better understand how professional and lay discourses influence patient participation in decision-making, we can help foster a dialogue that will improve end of life care by making sure that patients' preferences are being respected at this very important moment in their lives."

The objective is to bring Indigenous Knowledge Holders, community members, midwives, other health practitioners, researchers and academics together from across BC, Canada, and beyond, to share wisdom, diverse cultural experiences, and inform each other about Indigenous approaches to supporting pregnancy, childbirth, infant care and parenting. Through the Gathering, we will create spaces in which traditional practices can flourish, to the benefit of mothers, fathers, infants, families, and communities.
The Gathering is related to the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD), an idea that outlines how stresses experienced from conception to early childhood are crucial for a person's health and wellness over their lifetime and in future generations.  An Indigenous lens on DOHaD also considers the importance of Indigenous cultures, languages, collectivity, and interconnectedness with other people, beings and Mother Earth as central to the strength and resilience of past, present and future generations.  
Plans for ilhenaylhs chet s7elji have been made in consultation with Host Nations through respectful engagement practices.  Appropriate protocols have been followed.  Ceremonies and cultural protocols are interwoven throughout.  Formal and informal meetings will support culturally safe dialogue, honour Indigenous ways of knowing and be a time and place to initiate new and strengthen existing respectful, cooperative relationships. Arts and Land-based events will provide additional ways to experience learning and exchange ideas. The multi-day program attends to cultural details so that the gathering ""inspires innovation, creates connections and ignites dreams"" (quote, Elder Sharon)."

IBD is increasing worldwide, and Canada has among the highest rates in the world, representing significant burden to the health system. The reason for the increased incidence is uncertain, but may result from early life environmental exposures. Canadian health administrative data (supplemented by clinical and biological data) hold great potential to discovering the causes of this increase, and to determine ways of improving the care for Canadians living with IBD.The Canadian Gastro-Intestinal Epidemiology Consortium (CanGIEC) is a network of clinician-researchers and methodologists in 6 provinces using administrative data to develop a national picture of IBD. The CIHR Foundation Grant will allow for development of our network to examine and improve the care of people living with IBD, as well as determine causes of the high rate in Canada. Since IBD affects people of all ages, we will conduct research across the age spectrum. However, the incidence is rising most rapidly in children, the elderly represent the fastest growing group living with the disease, and IBD is most commonly diagnosed in people of child-bearing age. Therefore, our current research plan examines people of specific populations in whom IBD may greatly burden the patient’s life, the health system, and the economy. This application is focused on five aims:1. Pediatric IBD: In children, the fastest growing incident group, we will determine the direct and indirect costs to the economy, health system, and families. We will collaborate with the Canadian Children IBD Network, a population-based inception cohort study collecting clinical and biological data, linking these data to administrative data, and incorporating direct assessments of family impact.2. Elderly IBD: In people at greater risk for adverse events, we will assess whether comorbidity burden is associated with the use of immunomodulator and biologic medications, and adverse effects of these treatments.3. Materno-Fetal: In collaboration with MORe-CaRe IBD, a clinical network focused on pregnancy outcomes, we will describe the pregnancy rates, pregnancy complications, and outcomes of newborns of women with IBD. We will determine whether IBD disease severity is associated with these outcomes.4. Environmental Factors: To explain Canada’s high prevalence, we will determine early life factors which are predisposed to development of IBD, and factors associated with need for surgery after diagnosis.5. Methodological: We will improve the methods used to conduct research using routinely collected health data, increasing the capacity for research using these data in other fields.CanGIEC research will also increase capacity by training students, mentoring junior clinician investigators, and developing a skilled network of data analysts experienced in distributed network analysis of provincial health data. In addition, we have linked with partners and patient groups to develop our research plans, and to translate the results of the research to policy-makers and the public. Our clinical partner networks will move our results from the population level to the bedside by implementing change based on our findings. Therefore, we anticipate that CanGIEC will provide tangible advancements to benefit to patients with IBD, the health system, clinicians, and researchers."

Research is urgently needed on the extent to which current HIV-disclosure legislation may be undermining the protective health and health-seeking behaviours (e.g., HIV/STI testing and treatment) of sex workers, an historically vulnerable population for HIV-infection. Therefore, the fundamental aim of this study is to understand how HIV-disclosure legislation is impacting the health of sex workers and use this information to respond to their needs through informed policy, education for sex worker' health service providers, and accessible health/legal risk information for sex workers. Specifically, this study aims to determine: (1) The extent to which the recent court rulings have shaped sex workers' willingness to seek HIV-testing; (2) The implications for relationships of trust between sex workers and their support/service providers when discussing potentially criminal sexual practices; (3) How sex workers characterize the potential risk factors and legal implications of an HIV+ status when using a condom and/or with viral load below detectable levels; and (4) The extent to which sex workers are concerned that knowing and/or disclosing their HIV-status may result in violence, stigma, and/or future criminal charges. The proposed study will use a theoretical sampling strategy to recruit HIV+/-, male/female sex workers (n=16) for semi-structured, in-depth interviews, with a focus on persons with additional vulnerabilities such as Aboriginals, gay/bisexual men, and those with substance dependencies."

Aboriginal women are disproportionately affected by a number of structural, economic, social and cultural inequities. These inequities may lead to conditions of poverty, violence, gender inequity, drug use, housing instability and discrimination for Aboriginal women. In addition to being life stressors they are also HIV risk factors that have a tremendous negative impact on mental health. For Aboriginal women, the impact of HIV and life stressors on mental health and well-being must be approached from a wholistic context and consider physical, spiritual and emotional health and well-being in Aboriginal Women using culturally-appropriate methods. The overall aim of this postdoctoral project is to develop a culturally appropriate national stress-reducing intervention with an HIV knowledge component for Aboriginal Women living with HIV infection and who are HIV-negative. In order to reach the overall aim, a pilot project has been developed and is in progress in Ontario, Canada. The main objectives for each phase of the pilot project are 1) to characterize stress in the lives of Aboriginal women living with and at risk of HIV infection and determine their HIV knowledge, 2) to discuss and practice stress management approaches and conduct HIV workshops and 3) determine the feasibility of measuring stress levels using questionnaires and proteins in the saliva and implement a stress level measurement study.

Engaging Indigenous PWID in harm reduction is critical to reversing the current trends in blood-borne infections. Less is known about the harm reduction practices of Indigenous PWID in Sudbury and Sault Ste Marie, two of our study sites. Our objectives are to: 1) describe the practices, demand for and desired characteristics of harm reduction services and programs, 2) measure substance use and STBBI rates of Indigenous peoples, and 3) measure the association between factors (e.g., non-injection drug use, sexual health practices, demographic) and delayed injection drug use (IDU); and explore how factors affect delayed IDU over two years. We also aim to engage and hire Indigenous people in research. Our research activity involves survey design and an explanatory mixed methods design. Indigenous worldviews will be centred in our research. Outcomes: We expect to describe the harm reduction practices of Indigenous peoples and to identify factors that delay IDU to identify immediate service needs. Our findings may inform harm reduction services, and research and health service capacity building for trainees. Core expertise: Our proposal has Indigenous leadership with Benoit and Young, and Gauvin is an ally. Benoit conducts quantitative and qualitative research, survey design, Indigenous methodologies, and health service systems and intervention research. Gauvin has established harm reduction initiatives, conceptualized how research informs practice, and established Indigenous healing approaches at Elevate. Young has developed harm reduction programming, used Indigenous research methods, and collaborated on Indigenous-led community-based research including using social network analysis to map and measure the depth and directional change of relationships."

We plan to hold the event in Victoria, BC on March 18 & 19, 2023. A Lekwungen Knowledge Keeper will welcome all attendees (approximately 30 persons) and give our land acknowledgment. The first day will involve a national workshop opened by a keynote co-presentation from Indigenous scholar, Dr. Sarah Hunt, and an Indigenous community leader. This will be followed by a critical assessment of our bi-lingual draft intervention tool developed to advance sex workers' social justice and health equity - the Sex Workers' Activist School Facilitation Guide. The mobilization tool has been co-developed by members of seven sex worker organizations from across Canada and, to date, piloted in five communities. Day Two will involve an overview by a member of the Canadian Alliance for Sex Work Law Reform relating to the constitutional challenge to Canada's prostitution laws and presentations by four experts from Canada and New Zealand. The experts will analyze the importance of the mobilization project in the context of the need for sex workers to organize.  The symposium will be open to participants from the sex work community, social and mainstream media, allied community partners, and health and social policy-makers. A finalized version of the bi-lingual training intervention tool will be shared with other sex workers organizations."

At the same time, they also report many individual differences in health, and in the vulnerabilities and risk factors they experience. The last two years have marked substantial changes in the Government of Canada's approach to the sex industry. The Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act (PCEPA) amended the Criminal Code to criminalize - for the first time in Canada - the purchase of sexual services, and to further modify certain prohibitions related to advertising and communicating the sale of sexual services. This project will examine whether the PCEPA - a natural experiment out of the control of the research team - has alleviated or exacerbated health inequities for sex workers as compared to before the new laws were implemented. We will compare policing and outcomes associated with the practices surrounding the sale of sexual services by sex workers of different genders and working in diverse venues before and after the implementation of PCEPA. We will build off our existing data set of 210 interviews with sex workers in five metropolitan areas (Victoria, Calgary, Montréal, St John's and Kitchener-Waterloo-Cambridge) by recruiting a slightly larger number (250) of new and repeat participants from these same sites. The proposed research promises to a) advance our knowledge of health equity for marginalized populations; b) reduce avoidable risks and unmet health needs for sex workers in Canada; and c) develop community-based policies and practices in an effort to reduce the health inequities which exist between sex workers and other Canadians."

She has made major contributions to the mandate of the Institute of Population and Public Health by revealing constraints on socially disadvantaged groups and the structural forces that negatively influence their health, safety, access to services and social inclusion in Canadian society. For these individuals - including midwives, substance-using pregnant women, street-involved youth, and sex workers - the theme of human rights and dignity as health care workers, parents, and citizens is critically relevant in her research and knowledge translation activities. She was among the first to demonstrate how gender acts as a fundamental determinant of health that intersects with other social factors to create and maintain avoidable inequities. Her scholarship has challenged patriarchal attitudes and regressive policies about women's health care work, which has been taken up by activists to change national and provincial legislation relating to pay equity, midwifery and maternity care. She is also a pioneer in embracing a community-engaged participatory approach to study the health and health care marginalized groups, while at the same time developing sound ethical protocols. Using an integrated knowledge translation approach, she has even co-published peer-reviewed articles, chapters and reports with non-academic partners and trainees, including highly-cited articles on community-engaged methodology. As a trailblazer, she has served as the primary/co-supervisor for 45 trainees at Master's, PhD and Post-Doctoral levels and is committed to the support and development of upcoming scholars and researchers in population and public health research. She has received many accolades, including from the Royal Society of Canada, Canadian Academy of Health Sciences and the Governor General."

As of now however, limited data are available on the risk of PPHN associated with other types of antidepressants such as SNRI (venlafaxine, desvenlafaxine, duloxetine), bupropion, and mirtazapine. Given that PPHN is a rare condition (0.5% prevalence), large population-based cohorts are needed to quantify its association with gestational use of antidepressants. The same holds for the risk of cardiac malformations (a risk factor for PPHN) associated with SNRI, mirtazapine and bupropion. Hence, the objectives of this proposed study are to quantify the association between SNRI, bupropion, and mirtazapine use during pregnancy and the risk of PPHN, and major cardiac malformations (CM).
This study will be performed in 2 provinces (Quebec, Saskatchewan) and in the US. All three provinces/state have access to cohorts of pregnant women built with the linkage of administrative databases. Study methodology will be the same in each participating provinces/state and statistical analyses will be performed within each province/state separately. Province-specific results will be combined using meta-analysis methods with the province being the unit of analysis. This will be one of the few studies worldwide and the first study in Canada looking at the important risks of PPHN and CM associated with SNRI, bupropion and mirtazapine use during pregnancy, which will have great public health implication."

However, there is no consensus as to whether treatment should be initiated in the first trimester (when organogenesis occurs) or later (when theoretically vulnerability for drug-induced congenital malformation would be lower). With this study, we aim to answer the following research questions: 1) is the risk of maternal to child transmission (MTCT) of HIV altered when highly-active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) is started during the first trimester of pregnancy and continued thereafter compared to when HAART is started later in pregnancy (2nd or 3rd trimester) among HIV positive pregnant women, 2) is fetal exposure to HAART during the first trimester of pregnancy associated with an increased risk of major congenital malformations (MCM), compared to the risk of MCM in the general population, taking into account HIV status, and 3) is exposure to HAART during pregnancy associated with a significantly decreased risk of neonatal death when compared to the general population of pregnant women, taking into account HIV status. Case-control analyses will be conducted within three pre-established pregnancy cohorts (Quebec, Saskatchewan and US Medicaid pregnancy cohorts) taking advantage of already established cohorts with population-based administrative health data, representing approximately 400,000 (Quebec), 230,000 (Saskatchewan), and 7,104,231 (US) pregnancies (HIV and non-HIV pregnancies). All analyses will be performed within each cohort separately (with common protocols). Pooled estimates will be calculated using meta-analyses methodology.

Much of this exposure occurs because more than half of pregnancies are unplanned, resulting in millions of women and unborn infants exposed to medications during the organogenesis period because women did not know they were pregnant. It is troublesome that most observational studies of medication use during pregnancy have focused on the foetus or child, rather than on the physical and mental health effect on the mother, which is a factor that should carry significant weight when making decisions regarding medication use during pregnancy. Additionally, clinical trials of assisted reproductive techniques (ART) tend to focus solely on pregnancy rates and outcomes, rather than maternal health. The consequences of increasing medication use during pregnancy and increasing ART use on maternal health should become a public health priority. It is essential that good evidence-based data be available to guide the prescriber and the mother in their choice of drug treatment. The objectives of Mom-PREGMED will be achieved through a programme of research that includes population-based pharmaco-epidemiological analyses in Quebec, British Columbia and Ontario, prospective surveys of physicians and pregnant women, and a pharmacogenomic analysis that can ultimately lead to the development of Clinical Practice Guidelines on the safety and effectiveness of medication use during pregnancy. We have chosen to focus on asthma medication, antidepressants and hormonal medication used in assisted reproduction because of their frequency of exposure in pregnancy, their significance to public health, and because these are controversial treatment areas."
Medications and Pregnancy -  1st Canadian Mother-Child Cohort Active Surveillance Initiative Symposium.,"['Bérard, Anick']","['Oberlander, Timothy F', 'Sprague, Ann', 'Vinet, Evelyne', 'Bernatsky, Sasha R', 'Carleton, Bruce C', 'Chateau, Daniel', 'Eltonsy, Sherif', 'Kaul, Padmaja R', 'Walker, Mark C', 'Winquist, Brandace D']","['Canada-Us Comparison And Harmonization', 'Canadian Multi-Provincial Cohorts', 'Harmonization Of Codes', 'Medications', 'Pregnancy', 'Real-World Evidence', 'Standardization Of Codes', 'Team Building', 'Training']",19000.0,412228,"Evidence suggests that over 75% of women take at least one medication during pregnancy. Yet, data on the safety and efficacy of medications used during pregnancy is lacking due to the routine exclusion of pregnant women from clinical trials because of concerns about potential harm to the developing fetus. Hence, data on the safety, and effectiveness of drug exposure during pregnancy before marketing of new medications, or medications with new indications, is scarce. 
In May 2019, the Drug Safety and Effectiveness Network (DSEN) and Health Canada have provided seed funding to the Canadian Mother-Child Cohort Active Surveillance Initiative (CAMCCO) to put in place provincial mother-child cohorts using real-world evidence (www.motherchildcohort.ca). Digitization of health care provides new opportunities to close the divide between research and clinical care for medications used during pregnancy. This allowed Canadian perinatal pharmacoepidemiology researchers to join forces to start developing standardized and harmonized cohorts, based on the Quebec Pregnancy/Child Cohort and US Sentinel program models. Including data from multiple provinces will also result in access to more diverse populations. 
The aim of CAMCCO is to quantify the benefits/risks of medication use during pregnancy for mothers/children in a timely and valid manner in order to have significant impacts on how medications are used and prescribed during pregnancy and childhood, and how health policies are implemented.
CAMCCO is actively working on the implementation of this initiative by training within-province programmers, and has established a working environment among team members and stakeholders. Given that in-person meetings allow more brainstorming and increased efficiency as well as an opportunity for knowledge-transfer and training, we are planning the 1st CAMCCO Symposium in Montreal on February 20th, 2020. This team-building event is essential for future planning, and to establish priorities."

Training will include translational and crosssectional training using web-based courses/webinars in French and English (to ensure sustainability of events) in perinatal toxicology, pharmacogenomics, epidemiology, interventional medicine, AI - to ensure that we reach ECRs and trainees in far away places and internationally. A Summer School will also be included. Further topics covered will include grant, manuscript writing and presentation skills; EDI; and real-world evidence access and analyses. One annual in-person meeting (the Canadian Perinatal Network Annual Meeting) will create a community of perinatal investigators/ECR/graduate students/trainees in Canada; and on-site 4 months training within any CAMCCO-L's PI's laboratories. Curriculum evaluation will be done within CAMCCO-L's core objectives. Furthermore, a CAMCCO-L Platform Advisory Committee will be formed to guide and monitor the progress of the training platform as well as its future directions.

The impact of gestational medication use on pregnant people, children, and families across the lifespan is a main concern for several stakeholders, including health care providers, knowledge users (KU), policy makers, and those with lived-experience. Unlike in other developed countries, Canada does not have a comprehensive and harmonized Hub where stakeholders can go to obtain state-of-the art, valid, culturally-sensitive and up to date information on medication safety during pregnancy. This is unfortunate considering that Canada is a leader in research and training on Medications and Pregnancy. This void leaves over 500,000 pregnant people in Canada each year having unanswered questions about commonly used substances and unaware of potential critical risks. 

Over the past years, the Canadian Mother-Child Initiative has been put in place: a research component - The Canadian Mother-Child Research Cohorts (CAMCCO-Research, CIHR, CFI: www.motherchildcohort.ca ); and a training component - The Canadian Mother-Child Collaborative Training Platform (CAMCCO-Learn, CIHR, SPOR: www.camccol.ca).

Despite the high prevalence of relationship and sexual problems and the threat that they pose for long-term morbidity and mortality, our understanding of what fosters or hinders the development of satisfying romantic and sexual relationships remains extremely limited. The transition from adolescence to adulthood provides the ideal window for identifying emerging romantic relationship and sexual problems and preventing their crystallization. The present proposal leverages our ongoing cohort of 2904 adolescents, followed from ages 14-15 to 17-18, with the overarching goal of gathering novel data concerning late adolesecents' intimate relationships and sexual health over time as they transition to adulthood. Specific objectives are to examine the effects of (1) childhood victimization, i.e., child maltreatment, bullying and witnessing interparental violence, as risk factors, and (2) social support, intimacy and attachment as protective factors, on intimate relationships (relationship satisfaction, dating violence victimization) and sexual health (sexual function, sexual satisfaction and sexual distress) during the transition from adolescence to emerging adulthood in participants aged 18 through 22. We will also (3) test these associations in the sexual and gender minority subgroup. Our 2904 participants will complete online questionnaires at 6-month interval data collection waves over 4 years.  Findings may contribute to the prevention of relationship distress and sexual problems and their associated negative consequences on Canadians' health and longevity."

-Increasing collaboration between DSEN teams; 
-Creating tools to anticipate drug safety and effectiveness queries;
-Improving analytical methods, including the use of new analytical methods to study gender/sex interactions in comparative effectiveness analysis;
-Expanding ongoing research programs. 
We aim to make our research even more relevant for regulators through webinar series and seminars on relevant topics.  We will also communicate with knowledge users to best understand stakeholder needs.

Avian strains are also capable of combining with human strains, which allows new influenza viruses to evolve. The emergence of a new influenza virus with improved human-to-human transmission is of concern because it could cause the next global pandemic. The public health risks posed by avian influenza are particularly high in Bangladesh, where high population densities and expanding poultry production industries are bringing humans and animals in closer contact. Despite these risks, there is limited understanding of the seasonal transmission patterns of influenza in human and poultry populations in Bangladesh. To address this research gap, my PhD aims to evaluate human and avian influenza transmission to better understand risk of pandemic emergence and opportunities for control in Dhaka, Bangladesh. This project will bring together routinely collected datasets from laboratories, hospitals, and veterinary programmes in Bangladesh. Using these data, I will implement innovative statistical, mathematical, and epidemiological techniques to characterize the seasonal patterns of influenza in human and poultry populations, as well as simulate the impact of influenza control strategies. Plausible control strategies, such as human vaccination, poultry vaccination, and improved biosecurity practices, will be defined in collaboration with stakeholders in Dhaka, through local workshops and meetings. This work will provide researchers and public health experts in Bangladesh with novel tools to make informed and actionable decisions to control potential influenza threats and support human and animal well-being."
Population-based studies to determine enteric infection risk sub-groups in Low- and Middle-Income Countries,"['Berry, Isha']",['N/A'],"['Cholera', 'Global Health', 'Hepatitis E Virus', 'Infectious Disease Dynamics', 'Latent Class Analysis', 'Population Surveys', 'Serology', 'Surveillance', 'Vaccine Epidemiology']",100000.0,454775,"Cholera and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are infectious diseases transmitted by consuming contaminated or unclean food and water. There are about 6-million cholera and HEV cases reported each year, and the majority are in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. Disease risk at the local-level is thought to vary based on access to safe and effective water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) measures. However, recent studies found that cholera and HEV do not share a common spatial risk pattern at local-levels, which is surprising since they are both transmitted by water. This suggests that other population and environmental risk factors could be driving differences in disease. Prior studies have not examined these factors or how they cluster at the population level.  Also, no studies have examined how these factors change in settings where cholera and HEV vaccines have been administered. Large population-based studies are needed to identify population sub-groups at high risk for cholera and HEV, and to compare how these transmission pathways change due to vaccination. The proposed research will use novel cross-sectional representative surveys in Bangladesh to identify distinct sub-groups of clustered socio-behavioural, WASH, and environmental risk factors, then determine the association between sub-group characteristics and cholera and HEV. The research models will also be adapted to examine associations in a cross-sectional survey in a recently vaccinated population in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Findings will provide global public health experts with a better understanding of transmission pathways across LMICs, and support evidence-informed interventions to effectively reduce the burden of cholera and HEV. Additionally, the unique tools developed in this study will be flexible and can serve as a platform to be adapted for examining other water-borne infectious diseases in global populations."

But the measures put in place to protect their physical health - such as prohibiting visitors and contact with other residents and staff - is also impacting their social connectedness. What has this done to their mental health? And how can we mitigate the negative impact? 

This knowledge synthesis was designed to provide high quality, timely evidence that helps answer these questions and responds to the immediate needs of people living in LTC homes, their families and the people who work with them. Our team, composed of researchers as well as people with direct experience of living and working in LTC homes, will identify and synthesize research studies that have examined the impact of social connectedness on mental health for people living in LTC homes. We will also identify studies that looked at ways to maintain social connectedness and try to pinpoint which ones could be useful during COVID-19 as well as other future outbreaks.

Our partners will use these results to inform practice and empower LTC home residents and family to advocate for LTC home policies and practices. Our research team will use this knowledge to inform future studies. Our shared goal is to improve the mental health and well-being of people living in LTC homes."
The association between loneliness and cognitive decline and the roles personality traits may play,"['Bethell, Jennifer M']","['Andrew, Melissa K', 'McGilton, Katherine S', 'Morgan, Debra G', ""O'Connell, Megan E"", 'Phillips, Natalie A', 'Walker, Jennifer', 'Wittich, Walter']","['Adult', 'Cognition', 'Loneliness', 'Personality']",70000.0,410755,"Loneliness has been linked to negative physical and mental health and the impact has been compared to that of obesity and smoking. Loneliness may also be associated with dementia, although it's still not clear why. For example, loneliness may increase our risk of dementia but the early symptoms of dementia may also make people feel lonely. 

Personality traits are also tied to loneliness and heath. In fact, certain personality traits have been found to predict both loneliness and dementia. Despite the apparent link, very few studies have simultaneously considered the health impacts of personality traits and loneliness. The purpose of our study is to test the association between loneliness and cognitive change, while exploring the roles personality traits may play. For example, certain personality traits may predispose people to being lonely and this could impact their cognitive function. On the other hand, being lonely may impact cognitive function more or less, depending on a person's personality traits.  

For this study, we will use data from the comprehensive cohort of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), a randomly selected sample of just over 30,000 Canadians aged 45 years and older. Detailed data on CLSA study participants includes demographic and clinical information, as well as measures of loneliness, personality and cognition. We will use data that was collected at baseline and follow-up (roughly three years later) to analyze the relationship between loneliness and cognitive change, as well as the roles personality traits may play. In our analyses, we will account for a person's social support and participation, as well as demographic and health factors. We will also test whether these relationships are different for men and women. 

Ultimately, understanding the relationship between loneliness and cognitive change would help to identify strategies to maintain cognitive health."
Evaluation of Meningococcal C Conjugate Vaccine Programs in Canadian Children,"['Bettinger, Julie A']","['De Serres, Gaston', 'Dobson, Simon R', 'Halperin, Scott A', 'Kellner, James D', 'Scheifele, David W', 'Schryvers, Anthony B']","['Cohort Study', 'Conjugate Vaccines', 'Infant Immunization Programs', 'Meningococcal Disease Prevention', 'Meningococcal Serogroup C Vaccination']",699663.0,170733,"Infections with meningococcal bacteria are rare but cause serious, fatal illness.  Young children ages 0-5 years are at the highest risk for these infections.  Prevention is desirable, as about 15% of infected persons die, and another 15% suffer permanent injury. Infection can be prevented with an effective vaccine that is safe for use in infants and children.  The best vaccination program would provide protection throughout the peak years of risk (ages 0-5 years).  From 2003-2005 Canada started giving meningococcal vaccines to infants.  Cost factors limited doses to one dose at 12 months of age in most provinces, except for Alberta, which gives 3 doses and British Columbia (BC), which gives 2 doses. This study will identify and follow 1 year old children over five years to determine which program (1, 2, or 3 doses) and which meningococcal vaccine provides the best protection over the longest period of time.  Protection will be assessed by measuring levels of antibody against meningococcal bacteria at several times over the study. The groups will come from Nova Scotia where children receive one dose at 12 months of age; BC where children receive 2 doses at 2 months and 12 months of age; and Alberta where children receive the recommended 3 doses, at 2, 4 and 12 months of age.  Our results will provide important knowledge needed to define the best immunization program for young Canadian children."
Unpacking Vaccine Hesitancy among Perinatal Healthcare Providers: Influences on Beliefs and Practices,"['Bettinger, Julie A', 'Weissinger, Sandra']","['Roe, Ian', 'Dubé, Eve', 'Graham, Janice E', 'Greyson, Devon', 'MacDonald, Shannon E', 'Meyer, Samantha', 'Russell, Margaret L', 'Witteman, Holly M']","['Health Care Providers', 'Infant Vaccination', 'Maternal Vaccination', 'Pregnancy', 'Vaccination']",,363687,"Vaccination is estimated to have saved more lives over the past 100 years than any other health intervention. Yet, recent surveys indicate that one third of Canadian parents are skeptical about vaccine safety, unconvinced by the science of herd immunity, and hesitant about vaccinating their children. Prenatal vaccination evokes even more hesitancy, with concerns regarding safety and effectiveness of maternal vaccination in pregnancy leading to very low uptake of currently-recommended prenatal vaccinations in Canada (e.g., influenza vaccine uptake is <20%). Prenatal vaccine refusal is associated with subsequent refusal of childhood vaccination. 

Healthcare providers (HCPs) are known to play a crucial role in fostering vaccine acceptance among parents. Previous research indicates that pregnant women want more and clearer vaccine advice from the doctors, nurses, and midwives providing care from pregnancy through the immediate postpartum period, when many mothers struggle with prenatal vaccination questions and begin making their infant vaccination decisions. When HCPs communicate effectively about the value and need for vaccinations parents are more confident in their decisions. However, research indicates that HCPs need more training and information support in order to feel confident in recommending and administering vaccines. 

This proposed qualitative study will provide an in-depth understanding of the vaccine hesitancy of maternity HCPs (obstetrician/gynecologists (OBGYNs), family doctors, midwives, and nurses), including how attitudes and beliefs play out in clinical practice and explore their perceptions of information interventions aimed at increasing their acceptance and promotion of vaccines for pregnant women and infants."

Laying the foundation for innovative and equitable health systems: integrating critical pedagogy in health professional education,"['Bhandal, Taqdir']",['N/A'],"[""Aboriginal And Racialized People'S Health"", 'Health Inequity', 'Health Policy', 'Health Professions Education', 'Medical Education', 'Nursing Education', 'Public Health']",105000.0,365511,"Health professional education (HPE), an upstream element of our health system, is understudied and few effective reforms have been made in recent years.  While there are notable pockets of innovation the uptake of health equity perspectives in HPE has been limited. The specific aim of this research project is to address the gap in curriculum and pedagogy for medical and nursing (MedNurs) education in Canada.  In the context of recent calls by international organizations for the greater incorporation of equity-oriented perspectives, this project contributes to research on a vital stage of health systems planning.  To study this complex issue the project will employ a qualitative design using interview and ethnographic research methods. Interviews will be conducted with a purposive sample of 40-50 key informants and stakeholders across two Canadian universities and inquire about strategies, difficulties, and excellence in health equity, patient-oriented care, and cultural safety in MedNurs teaching and mentorship.  Observations in MedNurs classrooms will provide evidence for how these concepts are taken up in practice. The aim of the project is to understand if and how curriculum designers, teachers, and administrators in HPE take up critical advancements in theories of health equity when preparing students for practice.  Analysis of the data collected in this study will inform the development of a pedagogical framework, constructed with input from the MedNurs community and practice guidelines from HPE and higher education literature. The findings, framework, and subsequent knowledge translation will impact our collective goal of reducing health inequity experienced by vulnerable populations in Canada and beyond.  Policy-makers and educators will use the results of this project to increase the capacity of emerging health professionals to attend to global inequities that cut across race, Indigeneity, socio-economic class, sex/gender, ability and other social relations."

Water security is defined as adequate quality and quantity of water on a regular basis to meet human, economic, and environmental needs. Chronic water insecurity threatens lives, livelihoods, and culture in many of our Canadian Indigenous communities. This is partly evidenced by the fact that 78 long-term drinking water advisories (defined as in place for more than one year) and 35 short-term drinking water advisories currently affect First Nations communities in Canada. These circumstances impact people's internationally endorsed rights to health, water, and sanitation, but also impact their cultural and spiritual rights. They also prevent communities from taking on the responsibilities for environmental sustainability that go along with those rights. To redress the water-related health challenges faced by Indigenous communities in Canada, the proposed initiative will establish an Indigenous water-health advisory circle, review existing documents that look at effective network building and Indigenous water-health indicators, assess an existing network based out of the University of Saskatchewan, and develop a larger network through regional community gatherings to better understand the water-health challenges, strengths, and needs of participating communities. In undertaking this research, we will be able to i) co-build a research network focused on water-health challenges faced by rural and remote Indigenous communities in Canada; ii) develop ways to measure the effectiveness of the network; iii) establish 'wise' practices for implementing and sustaining a research network; and iv) contribute to reconciliation among Indigenous and non-Indigenous people with particular attention to Indigenous women who provide leadership around water issues."

Additionally, compare results on a global scale alongside institutional partners. 

To support the population in focus, community-based research and a systematic review are at the forefront of our approach. A systematic review will analyze factors that are affecting our population in focus. Followed by community-based participatory research (focus groups, etc) to understand how these factors can be implemented in the community. In conjunction analyze the way primary care providers play a role as a key player in the enhancement of education in newly immigrated South Asian populations. Globally, the enhancement of education and health promotion has shown positive behavior change to children and acts as a pivotal time in one's development to promote health literacy. 

We will establish a Community Advisory Board (CAB) for this study, with diverse representation from local families, public health, schools, community programs, and neighborhood organizations to inform our approach.

This phenomenon is known as ""aging in place"" and refers to aging in the environment of one's choice while having access to appropriate support and resources to ""stay put"". Aging in place necessitates a home adapted for older adults needs as well as a neighbourhood and community environment that fosters mobility, independence and social participation. Innovative housing and support service models such as Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORC) and cohousing communities are some of the initiatives that have generated interest among the research community and the aging population as potential aging in place phenomena. However, research on NORC and cohousing communities is almost absent from Canadian gerontological literature. The purpose of this study is to gain an understanding of the influence of physical and social environments of home and neighbourhood on aging in place processes among older adults in NORC and cohousing communities. This research project adopts a constructivist grounded theory methodology to guide data collection and analysis. The research design of this qualitative study consists of two data collection methods-photovoice and semi-structured interviews-among 20-24 cognitively intact, independently mobile older adults living in two types of setting: NORCs and cohousing communities in British Columbia, Canada. In helping to understand how innovative housing and support service models support aging in place, this research project will help Canadians to stay healthy, engaged and active in their home and community as long as possible."
Harm Reduction Strategies Associated with Gay Men's Group Sex Events,"['Birch, Robert']",['N/A'],"[""Gay Men'S Health"", 'Group Sex Events', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Knowledge Translation']",105000.0,307759,"If HIV infections among gay and bisexual men continue to escalate at existing rates more than half of current university aged gay men will contract HIV by the age of 50 (Flock, 2013). Resiliency Theory (Herrick et al. 2011) suggests that North American gay men face chronic exposure to stigma and discrimination, and stresses the need for strength based HIV programs for gay men. We propose that one answer is that effective programs will be emic, or internally derived from specific gay subcultures. Initial analysis (Roth et al. 2013) of data from the Momentum Health Study, a CIHR and NIH funded longitudinal study of Vancouver gay male health (www.momentumstudy.ca) indicates a subculture of Intensive Sex Partying (Prestage et al, 2009 ) associated with Group Sex Events (GSE). Despite repeated calls (Mimiaga et al. 2010; Solomon et al. 2011; Phillips et al. 2013) for HIV/STI intervention programs specifically designed for gay men attending GSE, to date no original programs have been formulated or implemented.

The Momentum team is in a strong position to design such a program, having already recruited over 115 men who report attending GSE from a total of 600 men. Adopting a mixed method approach we will first analyze already collected quantitative data to test the hypothesis that men attending GSE differ in terms of sexual behavior, substance use and psychosocial patterns, indicating a true gay subculture. If verified, then etic, or externally constructed generic safer sex intervention messages may in effect not be acceptable to these men. Our second hypothesis is that GSE participants practice HIV protection strategies at Vancouver GSE. To test this we will contact and interview Momentum participants who reported GSE attendance. We have ethics permission to do this, and have secured support from Vancouver gay HIV prevention organizations such as the Health Initiative for Men, to collaborate on the study of this important cultural and epidemiological phenomenon."

But very little is known about this social justice-oriented South-South health cooperation (SJSSC) and how it differs from other forms of global health diplomacy in terms of political values and how cooperative health activities are carried out.

This project will further understanding of SJSSC and its implications for improving global health by: 1) carrying out a conceptual analysis of the different forms of global health diplomacy and cooperation; 2) providing an in-depth examination of how SJSSC plays out in two key arenas: primary health care and health care workforce issues; and 3) building a dialogue between Africa and Latin America to explore the similarities and differences in the forms of South-South cooperation within and between the two regions.

These issues will be examined through a policy analysis of SJSSC, based on the following case studies: universal, comprehensive primary health care in El Salvador and in Venezuela; health worker deployment to, and regional responses around, health worker migration within and from Southern and East Africa; the rights-based elements of socially progressive South-South policies, and the role of regional health justice networks and cooperation in all of these efforts.

The ultimate goal of this research is to determine whether this new form of South-South health cooperation leads to greater policy autonomy, more sustainable and effective health equity policies, and improved global health diplomacy. This study will help inform Canada's global health activities and policies."

The preliminary literature review shows that none of these countries has evaluated the impacts mandatory HIV testing from the points of view of those tested. The central research question is: What are the impacts of the mandatory HIV screening policy that applies to all immigrant applicants and refugees to Canada since 2002? This project will 1) generate a new knowledge base on, and systematically document, the implications of testing on immigrants and refugees which has never been done before so as to inform and improve Canadian health policy decision-making; and 2) to assess the implications of mandatory HIV testing as a prerequisite for admission to Canada, setting these within broader discourses on social justice, political economy of health, globalization and human mobility, human security, and social and immigration policy.

With debilitating symptoms of an episodic nature, living and coping with SLE presents significant physical, mental, and economic challenges. Dr. Clarke and Dr. Elliot recently employed a mixed-methods approach to examine the economic impacts of SLE, which demonstrated those living with SLE often experience substantial direct and indirect costs, as well as altered career trajectories that are often less satisfying and financially stable due to poor public understanding of the disease, limited workplace accommodation, and flawed government policies. Stakeholder workshops were then held to review and interpret research findings, and identify priority areas to target change. Key issues included difficulty accessing disability benefits and navigating insurance systems. Findings from these research activities suggest the need to focus on system level interventions (i.e. government, policies and society interventions) that address overarching issues identified in the research to date, including disability support, supports for navigating systems (i.e. health care, insurance), access to medical specialists, and general public awareness of SLE. This proposal aims to build on these previous research findings through a planning meeting that will establish partnerships and leverage expertise between key stakeholders, including those living with lupus, lupus organizations, policy makers, and union representatives, in order to develop a viable strategic plan for the design, implementation, and evaluation of specific, relevant and actionable system level interventions that will have a positive and practical impact on the lives of those affected by SLE in Canada.

In lower resource settings, access to healthcare services for women, children and adolescent girls has been expanding. However, there is often much variability in the affordability, quality and experiences of care received by different socio-economic groups, and thereby in the level of health-related and financial hardship that families face. This research project will be conducted in India and Tanzania to measure differences in access to health services before, during and after childbirth for women in higher and lower socio-economic groups, the clinical quality of care provided when they access them, and whether this ultimately improves the health of women and their children. It will examine whether this is related to contextual issues like health system inputs, population density, female literacy rates or public policy in each region. The study will also involve in-depth case-studies in regions with varying socio-economic differences in the health of women and children to explore their experiences with and perspectives on healthcare services, and the context-specific reasons for any differences between socio-economic groups. This research will be conducted through established partnerships with academic and public health organizations in Tanzania and India. It will provide new knowledge by applying theories and methods from different disciplines to understand socio-economic differences in the accessibility, quality, and impact of healthcare services, particularly with a focus on the health system, socio-cultural, political, economic, geographic or other contextual factors shaping them. This will provide international partners with specific information to guide their programs, and contribute to Canada's role as a leader and ally in global health research to improve the health and well-being of all women, adolescent girls and children."

Thefore, the present project has 5 objectives: (1) to determine the total number of minutes of MVPA in 141 male and 141 female patients living diabetes for a 1-week period using an objective PA measure, (2) to map ""where"" patients are expending the total number of minutes of MVPA by linking accelerometry measures with a global positioning system (GPS) overall and by gender, (3) to examine the association between the time spent in MVPA and the MVPA location characteristics (i.e., the socioeconomic status, urban vs. rural, and access to MVPA opportunities associated with each MVPA location) overall and by gender, (4) to determine if the MVPA location characteristics (i.e., environmental) interact with the (a) intrapersonal (e.g., self-efficacy), (b) interpersonal (e.g., social support from family), and (c) institutional (e.g., perceived quality of care) levels of the social ecological model in the same way for male and female patients, and (5) to build capacity across Nova Scotia pertaining to MVPA issues via hosting a forum in each site's community that involves the research team as well as patients, family / friends, healthcare practitioners, and community stakeholders."
"Social, behavioral and transmission properties associated with diversity in HIV epidemics among people who inject drugs and other key populations","['Blanchard, James F']","['Archibald, Chris P', 'Becker, Marissa', 'Emmanuel, Faran', 'Sandstrom, Paul A', 'Tyndall, Mark W', 'Vickerman, Peter', 'Wylie, John L']","['Epidemiology', 'Hiv', 'Injecting Drug Users', 'Pakistan', 'Transmission Dynamics']",428369.0,255372,"Persons who inject drugs are at much greater risk of acquiring HIV than the general population. HIV prevalence has reached 50% among persons who inject drugs. In many countries, HIV epidemics in these populations spill over into other groups at higher risk such as sex workers, thereby greatly increasing the overall burden of HIV. Little is understood about why HIV epidemics in these populations at high risk are so diverse, with some expanding rapidly and others staying at a low level. This project will investigate reasons for this observed heterogeneity of HIV prevalence in six different cities in Pakistan, using studies of injecting behaviours and laboratory studies to see how how the HIV virus is spreading in networks of persons injecting drugs, and from those networks to sex worker populations. The study will also use mathematical models to simulate epidemics using the behavioural and molecular data to study why some epidemics expand faster than others. The study will also assess how important injecting drugs are in the overall spread of HIV in different cities, in comparison to spread through sexual routes. This project will provide a uniquely comprehensive understanding of the HIV epidemics in Pakistan, helping public health program planners to design effective HIV prevention programs for key populations in Pakistan. This information will also be valuable to understand Canada's HIV epidemic, which is also largely concentrated in key populations at greater risk for HIV, including persons who inject drugs and sex workers."

Des échecs de traitement de l'infection gonococcique ont été rapportés dans plusieurs pays, incluant le Canada. Face à cette menace croissante, un projet d'implantation de réseau sentinelle a été réalisé au Québec avec les objectifs suivants : 
1) Contribuer à assurer la réalisation d'un nombre suffisant de cultures de N. gonorrhoeae pour maintenir la surveillance de l'antibiorésistance; 
2) Documenter les caractéristiques épidémiologiques et cliniques des cas et fournir des renseignements complémentaires permettant de mieux cibler les recommandations thérapeutiques;
3) Détecter et caractériser les échecs de traitement. 
Le réseau sentinelle a été implanté en 2015 dans trois régions socio-sanitaires. Une représentativité (sexe, orientation sexuelle et localisation géographique) et la détection de 20 % des cas provinciaux sont visées. Les cliniciens participants doivent notamment favoriser l'application systématique des recommandations provinciales pour la réalisation de cultures et de tests de contrôle post-traitement. Une application web sécurisée centralise la cueillette d'information. Les caractéristiques sociodémographiques des cas, les expositions et comportements sexuels, les raisons de visites, les prélèvements effectués (avec résultats) et les traitements prescrits sont colligés. Les résultats de sensibilités aux antibiotiques sont obtenus par l'intermédiaire du laboratoire de santé publique du Québec (LSPQ) et jumelés aux données épidémiologiques et cliniques du réseau sentinelle.

Numerous interventions programs have focussed on taking Indigenous young people away to the bush and teaching them traditional skill sets as part of broader programs focussed on improving their sense of individual and community identity. These programs have varied depending on the communities and what they viewed as important and feasible during the time frame of the intervention program developed. Results based on community responses have indicated that these options are effective. The question is what part of these programs (structure, content, implementation strategies) can be used by other local communities to be transferred across the country given that there is clear awareness that one size does not fit all in the health promotion literature and in Indigenous cultural practices. 

While it is widely acknowledged that there are limited methods for measuring the nature, level and reach of health promotion programs in general, Canadian First nations community responses to these camps suggest that they were both effective and operated in a manner which built capacity for sustainability. 

Our three major aims are 1) improve the social and emotional wellbeing and health of Indigenous young people through enhancing engagement with Elders; 2) improve the social and emotional wellbeing and health of Indigenous young people through enhancing access to traditional knowledge and food practices; 3) improved SEWB of Elders due by enhancing engagement with young people as well as the overt recognition of their role in the communities in which they live."
Social modeling in pediatric pain,"['Boerner, Katelynn E']",['N/A'],"['Children', 'Experimental Methods', 'Family Factors', 'Health Behaviours', 'Pain Responses', 'Pediatric Pain', 'Sex And Gender', 'Social Modeling']",105000.0,257397,"Families provide an important context in which pediatric pain should be understood, and previous research has shown that how parents react to pain can have an influence on how their children react to and experience pain. How children learn from their parent's modeling of pain behaviours may be influenced by the sex of the child and parent; however, the majority of pediatric pain research on parent-child interactions has only focused on mothers. 

The proposed study will examine the impact of watching a parent's reaction to pain on children's own pain experience. Two hundred and forty parent-child pairs (50% fathers) will each complete the cold pressor task (CPT), which is a safe and commonly used method of inducing mild to moderate levels of pain in the lab. Children will first watch their parent complete the CPT, and will then complete the CPT themselves. Parents will be randomly assigned to display a natural, exaggerated, or minimized pain expression during the CPT. The pain experience of the parent and child will be measured with self-reports of pain intensity, pain threshold and tolerance, as well as coding of their facial expressions. Analysis will examine whether the child's pain behaviour and reports of pain are influenced by the parent's behaviours pain behaviour, and whether this differs based on the sex of the parent and child. 

This research will help increase our understanding of the role of fathers in pediatric pain, which has been understudied to date. The results of this study will also contribute to explanations of how pain behaviours can be learned through social modeling by children from their parents, which will have clinical implications for family-based interventions."
Navigational strategies in young and older adult Inuit trackers and hunters,"['Bohbot, Véronique']","['Chachamovich, Eduardo']","['Healthy Cognition', 'Hippocampus', 'Inuit', 'Navigation', 'Spatial Memory']",12000.0,325273,"Inuit hunters exhibit exceptional navigational skills. For centuries, they have found their way through seemingly homogeneous landscapes without using maps or navigation devices (Aporta, 2009). Although researchers have described the ways in which the Inuit hunters navigate, we do not know the specific cognitive strategies that they use to find their way. The Inuit hunters have been described to use a variety of environmental features to navigate, including the direction of prevailing winds, stars, landmarks, and snowdrifts. The fact that they use these ever-changing features implies that they are constantly forming complex spatial relationships between their current location, these environmental features, and their target location. Forming spatial relationships between objects is the hallmark of the ""spatial memory strategy"". Different strategies can be used to navigate, but we hypothesized that, during navigation, Inuit hunters would use the spatial memory strategy to a greater extent. Research from the laboratory of Dr. Bohbot has shown that participants who spontaneously use the spatial strategy (spatial learners) show increased activity (Iaria et al., 2003) and increased grey matter (Bohbot et al., 2007) in a part of the brain important for spatial memory relative to those using response strategies. Since spatial strategies and increased volume of the hippocampus are associated with healthy cognition and healthy aging, these results suggest that traditional occupations such as Hunting may promote healthy cognition by way of increasing spatial strategies that stimulate the hippocampus. The current grant will help us establish communication with various Nunavut communities in order to extend our findings to a larger population."

Despite their increased risk, remote Northern communities are often without resources for early prevention and intervention programs. A strong focus needs to be placed on creating intervention tools that will be accessible in Northern communities. Furthermore, little prevention or intervention research has been conducted with Inuit adolescents who are at risk for depression in Nunavut. The extent, severity and idiosyncrasies of Inuit adolescent depression need to be studied, and suitably tailored interventions evaluated. Cultural relevance, with regard to Inuit and adolescent culture, should be paramount in the selection of approaches.

Making I-SPARX fly in Nunavut strives to enhance resiliency and increase mattering by empowering youth who are at risk for depression with skills to foster their own mental health and positively contributing to the collective welfare of their communities. This project evaluates a holistic, multi-generational intervention that brings together cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), emotion regulation support (ER), culture identity and community processes to foster resilience. Included in the intervention is the use of an award-winning computer program, SPARX which uses CBT and ER skills to teach the user how to cope with negative thoughts and feelings. The proposed intervention will be anchored in the youth-driven design of an Inuit version of SPARX (I-SPARX), supported by Elders. This design will aim to integrate the six integral principles of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit. Additionally, youth will take on activities that engage their communities in the dissemination and practice of I-SPARX teachings. SPARX- once adapted to Inuit culture and with Nunavut youth making the program their own - may become a useful tool for both Nunavut youth at-risk for depression and for those working with them."

The aim of this proposal is to obtain funding to convene a group of Canadian and international experts to understand the infrastructure and funding mechanisms of other sero-epidemiology programs around the world, exchange knowledge on best practices, and strategize about obtaining sustainable funding for the iCARE Network.  

We will hold a 1.5 day workshop in Fall 2019. Day 1 will include two speaker sessions, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. Participants will work in small groups after each speaker session to facilitate brainstorming and thoughtful discussion. Day 2 will be centred on strategic planning, discussing priorities for laboratory work, and funding options. After the workshop we will disseminate a report to all participants and potential funders. The report will contain a meeting summary, strategic plan, and best practice recommendations for Canadian surveys.

Through this workshop we will strategically plan the future of our Network, expand our knowledge of population immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases, develop the ability to respond to new disease threats rapidly, and facilitate access for academic researchers to new and sophisticated methods to measure immunity."
Social inequalities in aging in place and access to health and social care,"['Bolster-Foucault, Clara']",['N/A'],"['Access To Healthcare', 'Access To Social Support', 'Aging In Place', 'Health Services Research', 'Long-Term Care', 'Mediation Analysis', 'Racial/Ethnic Disparities', 'Sex & Gender Analysis', 'Social Inequalities', 'Socioeconomic Disparities']",,443142,"The Canadian population is aging rapidly, and more than 17% of Canadians are now aged 65 or older. Although many older adults live with functional limitations and chronic diseases, most prefer to remain in their homes as they age rather than transition to long-term care facilities (""aging in place""). In this context, timely access to health and social services is critical for older adults who are facing challenges maintaining their autonomy at home. Without these resources, older adults are more dependent on emergency care and are more likely to be hospitalized and subsequently admitted to long-term care. Despite universal healthcare coverage in Canada, social inequalities in access to healthcare and social support remain prevalent, creating disparities in the ability to age in place among certain populations and leading to health inequity in older age. The objectives of my doctoral research are to evaluate how inequalities in admissions to long-term care, hospitalizations and emergency care use in older age are influenced by gender, socioeconomic position and rurality, and to examine the mediating impact of having access to health services and social support in reducing or perpetuating these inequalities. The results of my research will contribute to a better understanding of the social inequalities of aging in place and inform public health action and policy decisions aiming to reduce inequalities in healthy aging. The importance of such policies and practices is increasingly relevant with the growing population of older adults. Furthermore, the urgent need to improve care infrastructures for older adults has been highlighted by the disproportionate effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on older adults living in long-term care settings in Canada. As we enter the UN Decade of Healthy Aging (2021-2030), strategies to foster the autonomy and dignity of older adults are essential determinants of equitable health in older age."

Almost 100,000 people in Canada are admitted to the hospital annually because of a fall! The best way to reduce the number of fall injuries is to exercise regularly. As a result, many communities offer exercise programs for older adults to help reduce falls. However, according to the latest Canadian report, fewer than one in ten fall prevention exercise programs provide the best program possible, meaning that programs should be offered all year long, a least three hours per week, and focus on balance activities. In addition, some Canadians do not have such a program in their region. 
 
Our team includes local, provincial, and national partners, in addition to researchers and students from Canada and Northern Ireland. They have all collaborated to plan the Attract, Adapt, IMplement and Sustain (AAIMS) project to understand how to:
1-attract people who currently do not participate in fall prevention exercise programs;
2-adapt the programs currently offered that do not meet the recommendations;
3-offer a program that follows recommendations if needed;
4-keep offering a program in community settings.

The exercise program will be offered in-person, online, or in a combination of the two. We will collect information by interviewing key people over the course of the project and will test how many people registered for the program, if they come with different characteristics, if there are signs that programs will last, and if people who were doing the program fall fewer times compared to the general public. This program will help us understand how to better spread a program that works in many different places while reducing participant falls."

Correspondingly, experts have called for interventions to both reduce harms associated with opioid use and prevent the expansion of injection drug use practices within vulnerable communities. It is suspected that untreated opioid use disorder (OUD) -- a condition characterized by problematic opioid use resulting in significant impairment or distress -- is widespread and may be contributing to the increasing number of persons who inject drugs (PWID) by: 1) driving persons who have never injected before to seek more intense modes of drug use (i.e., via injection) and 2) increasing the likelihood that PWID (who assist in 90% of injection initiation events, i.e., the first time injection drug use of another) accept or initiate a request to provide injection initiation assistance. Therefore, it is hypothesized that enrolling PWID in opioid substitution therapy (OST) -- which can reduce the cycle of intoxication and withdrawal by blocking the effects of opioids -- will reduce the likelihood they share injection drug use practices with vulnerable individuals. This proposed research aims to: 1) estimate the prevalence of OST enrollment among PWID in Toronto, Ontario using prescription claims data; 2) determine the accuracy of self-reported OST enrollment versus prescription claims; and 3) assess whether PWID who are currently enrolled in OST are less likely to provide injection initiation assistance to others over time. In doing so, the intention is to provide evidence to support (or refute) the presumed protective effect of OST on injection initiation, while quantifying potential treatment gaps."

Although the main identified cause of COPD is cigarette smoking, other environmental factors may play a role in the development of the disease. Examples of these factors include air pollution, poverty, limited access to green spaces, poor diet and reduced physical activity. Individuals could be exposed to these factors over their entire lifetime, potentiating the risk to develop COPD. Unfortunately, we still know very little about the impact of these factors in COPD. With the growing urbanization and the increase in Canadian population, it is of high relevance to understand how these factors interact and lead to the development and progression of COPD. Our research project will leverage data from two studies: the Canadian Cohort of Obstructive Lung Disease (CanCOLD) and the Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research Consortium (CANUE). CanCOLD has recruited over 1500 participants across Canada, including healthy individuals, smokers and COPD subjects, and followed them over time. CanCOLD data includes detailed questionnaires on participants' environment, social context, lifestyle and health status. Additionally, participants undergo a series of tests to assess their lung function. CANUE is a nation-wide initiative that regroups a vast range of environmental measurements, including poverty index, air pollution, green spaces and weather changes. These measurements are available for every postal code in Canada. For the proposed research, we will link CanCOLD and CANUE data to determine how factors present in the environment can influence the development and progression of COPD.

Since these food environments often tend to be concentrated around schools, it is essential that these settings are further examined to answer the following research question: what is the relationship between food exposure and teen purchasing? This research will examine the retail food environments around high schools in London, Ontario, focusing on the food/beverage advertisements found on billboards, transit shelters, and storefronts that are located within 2000 meters of these schools. This research will also explore what these food retailers sell, their advertising techniques, and how this exposure influences teens' purchasing and consumption behaviours. A mixed-methods approach, including food environment audits and consultations with a local Youth Advisory Council (YAC), will be used to explore this dietary issue. Overall, evaluating students' exposure to food marketing techniques and teens' associated dietary behaviours will produce relevant, geographic knowledge through understanding this complex relationship within the context of London, Ontario. On a broader scale, my findings will contribute to the creation of a teen-informed, validated photo analysis tool that can be used by other researchers to comprehensively assess food environments across diverse research contexts. It will particularly shed light on the importance of measuring the 'information environment' within communities, which includes the food advertising and food marketing strategies that are exposed to teenagers. This research will ultimately inform land use planning, nutrition policy, and improve the health of adolescents worldwide."

The study is a sequel to OCHS and will be done in collaboration with Statistics Canada. The study has five objectives: (1) to estimate the prevalence of childhood mental disorders such as depression, anxiety and ADHD; (2) to assess how these disorders may be linked with other chronic health conditions and with social and academic difficulties; (3) to examine the extent to which families with children exhibiting mental health needs are receiving mental health programs and services; (4) to determine if the prevalence of childhood mental disorders has increased between 1983 and 2013, in association with increases in socio-economic inequalities; and (5) to investigate the larger contextual (family, neighbourhood, school) influences on risk for childhood mental disorder. Information will be collected from parents, teachers and older children, and from administrative records available from Ontario service providers.

In Canada, such screening guidelines appear to exist for colorectal cancer, but not for other common cancers such as lung, prostate, and breast cancer. Moreover, to our knowledge, our proposed study will be the first to describe the relationship between IBD and cancer in the Quebec population."

These high rates have led to rising concerns about current CC screening methods.
Women in Canada are about to face a radical transition in the provision of cervical cancer prevention, as the current, well-known Papanicolau ""Pap test"" will be replaced by the new human papillomavirus (HPV) test. Research has demonstrated that the sexually transmitted HPV is the necessary cause of CC, which led to the development of this new cervical cancer screening test, more effective than the Pap test in detecting pre-cancerous lesions.
Access to screening may be improved through an innovative HPV self-sampling technique, where women can collect their own cell samples. Self-collected sampling addresses many of the current barriers around screening and improves participation of women who are most at risk for CC.
Through community-led collaboration, our goal is to increase participation in CC screening in Nunavik by raising awareness of the importance of CC screening in women as they age, and by implementing a pilot screening program that is based on HPV self-sampling. To do so, we want to evaluate the effectiveness of self-sampling for integration into existing public health and clinical service systems in Nunavik.
Combining the perspectives of Inuit women and their service providers we defined the best implementation strategies, barriers and facilitators, as well as ways to monitor the process in terms of appropriateness, feasibility, cost, coverage and sustainability. Established evaluation and implementation frameworks will be used to guide the implementation evaluation.
We have formed an Advisory Committee who will be our guide in evaluating the process and results from this implementation strategy, in order to produce a scale-up plan for all Nunavik communities, and to be presented to the Nunavik Regional Board of Health and Social Services."

The Alberta Sex, Gender and Women's Health Hub will execute several inter-related research, training, knowledge uptake & collaboration activities. These will be guided by the principles of meaningful engagement of people with lived experience and community organizations, culturally safe work with Indigenous people, equitable, diverse and inclusive environments, as well as an intersectional approach.

An annual bidirectional public event will occur to return information to the community and co-establish new priorities for future hub activities. Offerings also include trainee financial support, post-secondary course credits, and experiential learning opportunities (internships) in partnership with community organizations and/or AHS. Trainees will also learn the workings of Alberta's pan-provincial healthcare system, which will contribute to career planning through demonstrating career paths within health service organizations and/or enhancing impact of their research. A formal mentorship program will provide trainees with opportunities for diverse mentorship matched to their strengths and goals.

We will support researchers and health professionals with leadership training focused on improving advocacy for evidence-based improvement for women's health within, and beyond, the organizations that they are presently employed. Members will be meaningfully engaged in this hub to ensure that programming is of the highest scientific quality and that it is timely, relevant and responsive to the needs of the female people and women in Alberta."

Between 10-15% of all breast cancers are caused by a hereditary predisposition. Hereditary breast ovarian cancer (HBOC) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by germline pathogenic mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes. It is the most common cause of hereditary forms of both breast and ovarian cancer. Risk prediction models (e.g. Gail, BOADICEA) can be used to assess these risks in HBOC families but have been proposed mainly for cancer risk estimation among BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and have raised a number of limitations. The prediction ability of most existing risk prediction models is relatively modest and their large discrepancy in determining high-risk women who might benefit intensive screening/interventions, make their clinical utility questionable. Given their importance for genetic counseling and clinical management of HBOC cases, it becomes more than timely to extend risk prediction models. Our research proposal will fill some important gaps in several areas: a) It will yield enhanced risk predictions of cancers in HBOC families; b) It will provide a better assessment of mammographic screening and prophylactic surgery in HBOC families; c) The dynamic predictions of cancer risks in HBOC families could lead to a more personalized clinical treatment of HBOC patients."

Studies have also found that oral diseases are highly prevalent among these groups despite the availability of dental coverage for many of them; yet most patients see a dentist only for emergency purposes while oral diseases further progress. Stigma remains a major barrier for regular dental care utilization. However, research on stigma as experienced by patients in dental settings falls short, but indicates that most of these patients feel they are not well understood by dental professionals at best, and denied care at worse. Brondani will present his latest study focused on minimizing stigma and engaging HIV-positive individuals in utilizing educational and support services via community-based participatory study. Although new HIV diagnoses in Canada have fluctuated, stigma against those carrying the virus is still prevalent, has many forms and manifests in different manners. By using a qualitative approach, Brondani trained six peers from the community to facilitate 6 focus groups among 45 Aboriginal People and refuges from Latin America who were HIV positive. Thematic analysis revealed that some individuals living with HIV may remain marginalized, not accessing proper health care and not fully engaged in educational support and collective action. They also likely feel disempowered, with lack social support while holding self-stigma further enhanced by detrimental behaviours expressed by dental professionals. The roots of stigma as subjectively experienced by HIV-positive members from these two marginalized communities will be also shared while informing on the development of strategies to address and minimise stigma"

However, with advanced age, there is an increased risk for community institutionalization in which oral health is largely neglected. Dental geriatrics in public health can focus on health and institutionalized elders, and combined community service learning - CSL, can expose undergraduate dental students to the needs of this population as a public health issue. Research is still needed to evaluate the educational aspects of CSL geriatric education on the students as learners and health care providers, on the geriatric community as service recipients, and on public health program and policies. It is opportune to encourage discussions on these topics and on the need to continuously implement dental geriatrics beyond the classroom. The main objective of this symposium is to present different aspects and experiences of dental geriatric education aimed at: sharing the different approaches taken for CSL dental geriatrics across dental schools; promoting dialogue on the joys and challenges in implementing CSL within different geriatric dental curricula and its impact on health policies and programs; sharing speakers' experiences in implementing and evaluating reflections as an educational tool for students' leaning and a venue for community engagement in dental geriatrics. The educational objective of this symposium is to engage policy makers and dental schools in discussing CSL and reflection within geriatric dental education. This symposium is geared towards undergraduate and graduate students, educators and teachers, policy makers and advocates, and investigators directly or indirectly involved with dental geriatrics.

There is increasing evidence that regular physical activity (PA) can improve the overall health status, functional capacity, and QOL of children with cancer. Our mandate must be to determine how best to deliver PA interventions, including education and actual PA practice, to increase awareness of the benefits and help children and their family's transition into a physically active lifestyle in cancer survivorship.
Our main objective in this dissemination program is to promote an active lifestyle in pediatric cancer patients to enhance their overall QOL.  To attain these objectives, we have two specific aims:
A)Develop exercise guidelines that follow critical medical and fitness evidence and include resources and practical tips, to promote active living in the pediatric oncology population. We will create two versions of this ""Pediatric Oncology Exercise Manual"" (POEM) - one for families and one for professionals. 
B)Disseminate the POEM to relevant user groups through various venues, including mail outs of the manual and associated brochures, delivery of educational sessions, and widespread dissemination of a training package, so that other centres can offer trainings in their local area(s).  

This manual will answer the questions that survivors, parents, health care professionals, fitness professionals and educators have around the safety, recommendations, potential contraindications and resources available for exercise in pediatric oncology. More than 10,000 childhood cancer survivors are living in Canada today. Our hope is that this manual will provide benefits to all user groups, including the survivors."

Previous studies that assessed iron status in populations focused primarily on iron deficiency, while relatively few have examined elevated iron status, which is more common in developed countries. With growing evidence linking elevated iron to increased risk of cancer and other chronic diseases, identification of factors associated with elevated iron status is warranted and of public health importance. In particular, iron accumulation following menopause has been suggested as a risk factor for breast cancer in older women. Excess intake of iron through diet, especially in the form of heme iron from red meat, has also been shown to cause breast cancer in animal models, although evidence from human populations is less conclusive and warrants further research. Therefore, this research project aims to provide a better understanding of the role of iron in women's health, particularly in the development of breast cancer, with potential implications for dietary recommendations from a Canadian perspective. Specifically, the first objective is to investigate dietary and non-dietary (e.g., lifestyle, reproductive) factors associated with elevated iron status in a nationally representative sample of women from the Canadian Health Measures Survey. Iron status will be assessed based on concentrations of serum ferritin, a widely accepted marker of body iron stores. The second objective is to study the association between iron intake (total, dietary, supplemental) and breast cancer risk among Ontario women by comparing intake levels between breast cancer cases and controls from the same population. The association between heme iron intake and breast cancer risk will also be examined. Analyses for both research objectives will be conducted separately for pre- and post-menopausal women."

Adolescent sexual and reproductive health (ASRH) indicators are worse in the north of the country, including in Bauchi State, where the cultural context limits open discussion of the issues.

Over the last five years, a partnership of CIET/PRAM from McGill University, a Nigerian NGO (Federation of Muslim Women Association of Nigeria) in Bauchi State, and the Bauchi State Primary Health Care Development Agency implemented and demonstrated impact of a program of universal home visits for improving health of mothers and children. The partnership also explored the sensitive issue of child-spacing and co-designed with stakeholders culturally safe interventions to support child-spacing. This work has built trust between researchers and local leadership and communities.

This project uses a participatory approach involving stakeholders throughout. Stakeholders (including female and male adolescents, parents, service providers and planners) will map their knowledge of causes of ASRH risks. This will inform tailoring of survey instruments to collect information from adolescents and parents in households, and from local service delivery institutions. Working with adolescents, we will create materials such as video dramas to share findings with stakeholders in communities and services. Adolescents and other community stakeholders will discuss the evidence and plan and implement local culturally acceptable actions to improve ASRH. We will measure the short-term impact of these actions qualitatively, through stories from stakeholders, and quantitatively in a repeat survey.

In a final phase, the research partnership will disseminate the findings more widely, and support Bauchi state planners and policy makers to develop evidence-based policies and strategies to improve ASRH."

In light of recent studies showing that vitamin supplements are mostly not helpful and may even be harmful, it is increasingly clear that molecule-by-molecule approaches to guiding nutrition are insufficient. How then can nutritional guidance for older adults be more precise than simply ""eat well""? There is very little scientific understanding of how nutrition affects the physiology of aging, in part because the cellular and molecular links are complex and the fundamental mechanisms of aging remain controversial. Addressing this problem is not simple. We need to (1) find appropriate ways to simplify and accurately measure the complexity of what people eat, and of how our bodies age; (2) use data sets that permit us to see how one affects the other within aging individuals over many years; and (3) use sophisticated analytical approaches that let us examine how both nutrition and underlying biology change with age, and how each of these changing systems affects the other as it changes. Our team has this broad expertise, and we will use NuAge, the only cohort study in the world with sufficiently detailed data on both nutrition and biomarkers during aging to tackle these questions. Innovative and validated analytical methods will identify key signals from complex data on nutrition and aging biology, and then assess how these trajectories interact during an individual's lifetime. Our preliminary results have already identified dietary changes that appear to slow aging. The results of our study will (a) help establish how nutrition impacts biological aging processes; and (b) allow us to develop dietary strategies for aging adults exhibiting specific biological aging signatures, measurable through biomarker profiles."

The goal of the proposed research project is to learn more about how reproductive health and chronic disease are related throughout a woman's lifetime. To achieve this goal, I will describe how reproductive health events are related to each other over a woman's life and will examine how different reproductive health events (such as age at first period) will impact the possibility of being diagnosed with a chronic disease (such as obesity and Type II diabetes) as women age. Understanding how reproductive health may impact women's health over time is incredibly important as Canada's population ages and the number of people with chronic diseases increases. Improving our understanding of women's health will help us learn how to better screen for and prevent chronic diseases. Recognizing the importance of women's health over the life course is critical to improve reproductive health care among women of all ages and to prevent chronic disease and promote healthy aging among older women."

Les objectifs de cette étude sont donc de 1) confirmer que les trois troubles sont bien distincts et de 2) explorer le rôle des perceptions de soi, des autres et du monde comme mécanismes pouvant expliquer l'apparition de chacun de ces troubles chez les survivants de traumas. Mille participants âgés de 18 à 25 ans et représentatifs de la population québécoise compléteront des questionnaires en ligne mesurant leurs antécédents de traumas, leurs perceptions d'eux-mêmes, des autres et du monde, et leurs symptômes de trouble de stress post traumatique, de trouble de stress post traumatique complexe et de trouble de la personnalité limite. D'une part, leurs résultats seront analysés pour déterminer si on retrouve dans l'échantillon des participants qui n'ont aucun symptôme correspondant aux troubles, ainsi que des participants présentant des symptômes de chacun des troubles distinctivement. D'autre part, des analyses statistiques seront faites pour vérifier quelles perceptions (sur soi, les autres et le monde) expliquent le lien entre les traumas et lesquels des trois troubles"

A culturally appropriate, sustainable, scalable approach is needed to create healthier environments that will reverse the upward trajectory of diabetes in Indigenous communities.

Our Indigenous Diabetes Reduction Bond aims to sustainably reduce diabetes rates. Upfront capital from impact investors will fund customized infrastructure and healthy lifestyle interventions. Successful outcomes will be purchased by governments, who will benefit from the associated reduced health care costs. These funds will drive sustainable re-investment in the program.

This proposal is about augmenting the pilot phase of the Bond. With our partner communities we will identify additional health and wellness outcomes that are beyond our current health economics scope. These outcomes will integrate traditional Indigenous concepts of holistic wellness with Western biomedical science. They will include direct measures of diabetes risk as well as related measures such as sleep, stress, and emotional health. We will use these measures to conduct baseline assessments of diabetes risk and wellness, and then to provide an early assessment of the impact of the interventions. 

The additional funding will help us identify new ways of evaluating the impact of diabetes prevention and wellness promotion interventions. This will accelerate and enhance our engagement with impact investors and outcomes purchasers and allow us to scale up our work more rapidly and efficiently.

The findings from this project will be immediately implemented by four pilot communities in the Island Lake region to further develop local diabetes prevention and health promotion efforts. They will also guide the design of the next few phases of the Indigenous Diabetes Reduction Bond. In the longer term, the same model can be adapted to address other health problems that disproportionately affect Indigenous people in Canada."
Memory and stress related to medical examination among sexually abused children,"['Cyr, Mireille']","['Dion, Jacinthe', 'Frappier, Jean-Yves', 'Hébert, Martine', 'Tremblay, Karine']","['Anxiety', ""Children'S Memory"", 'Intellectual Functionning', 'Medical Examination', 'Pain', 'Sexually Abused Children']",213654.0,252001,"Child sexual abuse is prevalent in the general population and can lead to serious health outcomes. Research on the capacity of children to recall events experienced has shown convincingly that they can provide accurate accounts of these events. However, the testimony of children tends to be incomplete and fragmentary. Children omit to report key information about touches on their body, the perpetrator and the location where the abuse occurred. In addition, these children are also more likely to have some delays in cognitive and language abilities that may impact their testimony. The proposed research concerns the evaluation of child capacity to recall touches on their body, persons and location after an ano-genital medical examination. Participants will include children with a wide range of cognitive functioning, the latter in terms of intelligence, memory, and verbal skills. Anxiety and pain experienced during the medical examination and its impact on children's memory will also be assessed. A total of 135 sexually abused children from 6 to 12 years old will be recruited. These children will be interviewed according to a structured protocol used in investigative interviews, one week after their medical examination. In addition, use of the interview protocol alone will be compared against two other retrieval strategies: interview protocol plus drawing and interview protocol plus mental context reinstatement. Results will help better understand children's memory and their capacity to recall physical touches in a context similar to the one for current investigative interviews. Results will also help medical staff better prepare children and parents for the medical exam so as to reduce its potential negative impact."

Others are under consideration and development. Using participatory action research methodology (PAR), the research examined the impact of the mine and employment at the mine on Inuit women in the community of Qamani'tuaq (Baker Lake) Nunavut Territory. The research examined the extent to which women were part of the process of negotiation for the mine. Women were not adequately consulted with the result that operational considerations impacting them and their families did not receive adequate attention. The research identified important intersecting impacts with implications for an exacerbation of gender differences related to income, increased use of alcohol and drugs with implications for domestic violence, the exposure of women to harassment and sexual assaults as a result of their employment in housekeeping services, implications for the school attendance of children as a result of the 'two-week in, two-week out' work schedule and a lack of facilities and programmes in the community for dealing with these and other issues."

A strong body of research has shown that even mild to moderate maternal emotional distress during pregnancy adversely impacts mothers and their offspring. Given the likely increase in emotional distress experienced by pregnant women during the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need to promote the mental health of pregnant women with programs that can be delivered remotely. Out team has been ahead of the curve in recognizing the need for developing evidence based online care strategies. We have developed a bilingual prototype website entitled HealthyMoms which is comprised of accurate and understandable information on the impact of stress, depression and anxiety during pregnancy. Tools to promote emotional well-being and healthy behaviours during pregnancy are provided. The present COVID-19 crisis and the expected mental health fallout from the crisis presents an important opportunity to evaluate the potential of our online platform to address the mental health needs of pregnant women and reduce the risk of perinatal depression. Our approach to promote maternal mental health during pregnancy with a far-reaching web-based support program fills an important and urgent gap to address the short and long-term psychological  impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the potential to positively impact maternal, infant, and family outcomes."

When compared to the general provincial population, Status Indians in British Columbia (BC) experience a substantially higher rate of stillbirths and infant mortality.  

Our objectives are: (1) To quantify fetal and infant mortality and newborn illness rate among Status Indians and the general population in British Columbia. (2) To study what causes of death are responsible for potential differences in fetal and infant death rates (3) To explore the determinants for differential rates of fetal and infant mortality and newborn illness rate among Status Indian women and infants in British Columbia. 

We will use data located at: (1) BC Vital Statistics, (2) BC Perinatal Data Registry and (3) Population Data BC and its data holdings (formally the BCLHD) at the University of British Columbia. Linkage of these three databases will permit access to all data needed to study mother and infant health from conception through infancy to one year of age. This will be done in close collaboration with the Aboriginal Committee of the BC Perinatal Health Program.

Analyzing the linked data will lead to a greater understanding of why a Status Indian fetus/infant has a higher chance of death compared to the rest of the BC population. In turn, this new evidence-based knowledge can facilitate better education for improved personal health, population health and health care practice and more effective health care service delivery for Status Indians. Beyond providing opportunities for improved personal health, clinical practice and training, the potential is great for lowering the rate of fetal and infant mortality in BC Status Indian communities over time. The study will also provide opportunities for further research to explore other questions related to perinatal complications and infant outcomes."

Warnings of danger and risk aren't enough: new clinical approaches in talking to youth about sex,"['Daly, Leslie K']",['N/A'],"['Adolescent Sexual Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Interpretive Description', 'Primary Care', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Sexuality', 'Social Context']",105000.0,184455,"Health care providers often miss opportunities to communicate sexual health information to youth.  When health care providers do take on the task of discussing sexual health these conversations emphasize the dangers and risks of sexual behavior, often overlooking both youth's motivations around sexual decisions and their concerns and questions. A growing number of researchers argue that a singular focus on the risks of sexual behavior limits health care providers' abilities to provide youth with needed knowledge, guidance and support. To date, little progress has been made in establishing effective ways to communicate sexual health information to youth.  One first step in developing more effective ways of talking about sex is to ask youth what they need in clinical conversations that address the broader concept of sexuality, not only sexual risk.  The objective of this study is to develop effective ways of talking about sex that move beyond the limitations of current approaches. The central research questions are: 1- What new content should be developed for a comprehensive model of communication? 2- What new communication strategies should be developed to respond more effectively to sexual health needs?  Individual interviews and focus groups with youth will be used as a primary source of data. This study will develop comprehensive strategies that are required to inform, empower and support youth in making healthy and responsible sexual choices. Comprehensive sexual health education results in postponement of first sexual intercourse, decreases in number of partners and significantly increases condom use. This inquiry represents an important foundation for health care providers to develop more effective ways of talking about sex that extend beyond a primary focus on sexual risk. A novel youth-engaged approach concentrates on youth's perception of their sexual health needs, a rare opportunity in a conversation where adult and expert opinions predominate."
"Impact of Cash Transfers and Micronutrient Powders on Stunting and Iron Deficiency in Children 6-23 Months in Northern Zambia, A Randomized Control Trial","['Daly, Zachary R']",['N/A'],"['24 Hour Recall', 'Anthropometry', 'Cash Transfers', 'Children', 'Food Security', 'Hemoglobin', 'Iron Deficiency Anemia', 'Micronutrient Powders', 'Serum Ferritin', 'Stunting']",17500.0,280801,"Child malnutrition is of major concern globally, negatively impacting the lives of millions of children. Two specific forms of malnutrition are stunting, caused by chronic undernutrition, and anemia as a result of extreme iron deficiency. In Zambia 52.9% of children under 5 years are anemic and 45% are stunted. Childhood stunting leads to impaired cognitive development, poor school achievement, and lower adult wages, while anemia in children can cause negative impacts on intellectual and physical development. In light of this, the Zambian government has initiated a Cash Transfer program, whereby households with a child under 5 years receive a stipend from the government. The purpose of the program is to increase food security and improve child health. Simultaneously, Irish Aid and UNICEF will be distributing Micronutrient Powders (MNPs) to children 0-23 months, combined with nutrition education. MNPs are single use packets of vitamins and minerals which are added to a child's food just before it is consumed. Our research will assess the impact of the cash transfers paired with MNPs in lowering rates of stunting and anemia in children. We expect that MNPs with cash transfers will prove more effective than cash transfers alone. In order to test this we will randomize 300 households in Northern Zambia who have a child 6-23 months of age to one of three groups: cash transfer only, cash transfer plus MNP, and a control. Stunting will be measured using physical measurements, as well as proxy variables such as child feeding practices, child food intake, and the incidence of disease. Iron deficiency will be measured using blood samples. The Zambian government is hoping to scale up the cash transfer program, and as such it is critical to know whether it is having the desired impact on child health. Furthermore, while MNPs have been proven effective, there is little research on their pairing with cash transfers, a gap this research will fill."

Maternal stress hormones can cross the placenta and impact the foetus, and these effects can last throughout life. For example, stress during pregnancy can influence children's IQ, behaviour, and language skills. Studies in animals also suggest that stress during pregnancy is related to later health effects such as obesity and high blood sugar, but we do not know if this is also true for humans. Pregnant women cannot be assigned to stress or non-stress groups, so human studies of stress during pregnancy are difficult to design. 

We study stress during pregnancy by measuring stress levels of women who were pregnant during the 1998 ice storm in Québec and during flooding in Iowa (USA) in 2008. We have studied the development of their children, now 2 ½ years old (in the Iowa Flood Study) and 12 ½ years old (in Project Ice Storm), since their birth. We have measured the children's height and weight, and we are also studying measures such as waist circumference, body fat, and blood sugar. Our studies show that, compared to children whose mothers had lower levels of stress during the ice storm, those whose mothers had high stress levels were shorter at birth and were more likely to be obese at age 5 ½. We will study the same growth measurements for the children in Iowa, and for children at later ages (8 ½, 11 ½, and 13) in Project Ice Storm. We expect that children whose mothers had high levels of stress will have greater risk for obesity at all ages, have higher blood sugar levels, and will gain weight and body fat earlier in adolescence. This research will help us understand the extent to which stress during pregnancy might affect foetal and childhood growth, and increase some children's risk for health problems later in life."
Motherhood Deferred:  The Role of Women's Knowledge and Beliefs About AHR in Their Decisions to Delay Childbearing,"['Daniluk, Judith C']","['Cheung, Anthony P']","['Assisted Human Reproduction', 'Delayed Childbearing', 'Fertility Awareness', 'Reproductive Decision-Making']",,192026,"The fertility rate over the last 20 years in Canada has steadily declined for women in their twenties, while tripling from 14% to 48% for women in their thirties. The birthrate for Canadian women in their forties has also tripled in the past 30 years. The psychosocial and medical consequences of delayed childbearing are so serious that fertility specialists in England have coined the term ""infertility timebomb"" in reference to the increasing number of women who, in delaying childbearing, significantly reduce their chances of having children. Although recent research suggests many women are aware that fertility declines with age, some women appear to believe any age-related decline in fertility can be compensated for through the use of assisted reproductive technologies such as IVF. However, assisted human reproduction (AHR) is often financially prohibitive, restricted in availability, and limited in terms of success rates, particularly in cases of age-related fertility decline - leaving some women unintentionally childless. It is essential to assess women's fertility knowledge and beliefs about delayed childbearing, AHR treatments, and alternate parenting options, in order to develop targeted and effective educational strategies and interventions to support fertility awareness and informed reproductive decision-making. In this study a Fertility Awareness Survey (FAS) developed and pilot tested by the researchers will be administered to a geographically and demographically diverse sample of at least 1,000 childless and presumed fertile Canadian women between the ages of 30 and 45 who intend to pursue a pregnancy in the future. The FAS will assess participants' fertility knowledge and beliefs about AHR, as well as identifying their current and preferred sources for accessing reproductive information. The findings will inform health policy and guide the development of targeted public education programs and material to support informed reproductive decision-making."

There are fewer children per family, more women are working in the paid labour force, and more men are becoming involved in the provision of informal/family care by assuming the caregiver role. In addition, due to technological advances in medicine, the general population is living longer, which raises concerns regarding the increasing use of the health care system and the prevalence of chronic diseases. In Canada, long-term informal caregivers play a major role in caring for the senior population while receiving little or not support from employers or the government. Due to inadequate support, recent studies have shown that caregivers are at high risk in developing chronic diseases and thus, potentially straining and threatening the Canadian universal healthcare system and weakening the economy. Currently, Canada has no long-term policy to support long-term caregivers and to address the arising health dilemmas. One concern not addressed is the activity-travel behaviour of caregivers and which health factors may be strongly impacted. Therefore, the goal of this study is to convey valuable information to informal caregivers in terms of potential accessibility to the nearest support services of the dependent's needs, and how they can improve their activity-travel behaviour via a temporal and spatial analysis, and in so doing, maintain their health. Results will allow us to develop recommendations in how to prevent chronic diseases from occurring.

Quebec is one of only two provinces that have not begun to establish an organized cervical cancer screening program and, in fact, very little is known about screening practices among women who live in this province.  Because it will likely take some time for a province-wide program to be established, there is a role for local public health agencies to develop targeted programs to improve the demand and availability of screening within their jurisdiction. This project aims to describe the socio-demographic characteristics (such as age, educational attainment, income, and country of birth) of women residing on the island of Montreal who have not recently received cervical cancer screening.  Additionally, we aim to describe in which neighborhoods women who have not recently been screened reside and to assess the characteristics of these neighborhoods (such as the density of physicians or the percentage of people who live in poverty) that explain the observed patterns.  We will achieve these aims by analyzing data from several waves of the Canadian Community Health Survey that have been linked to a dataset that contains information on the characteristics of Montreal neighborhoods called MEGAPHONE (Montreal Epidemiologic and Geographic Analysis of Population Health Outcomes and Neighbourhood Effects).  Understanding factors that predispose and enable women to be screened will permit public health decision makers to assess the need to develop programs that increase women's understanding of the importance of screening and aid women in obtaining a screening test."

Many women not only suffer physically from the disease, but socially and economically as well. Women with cervical cancer are often stigmatized by their community and family. Currently there is little literature that measures the social and economic impact of cervical cancer of women, their children, and families. 

GOAL: Understand the impact of cervical cancer in Uganda on women and their families.

RESEARCH PLAN: This study will recruit women diagnosed with cervical cancer from the Uganda Cancer Institute over an eight-week period. Participants will complete a written survey which will include questions on their diagnosis, treatment, dependents, and household tasks. Following the survey, participants will be interviewed about the impact of their diagnosis on their families. Survey data will be analyzed to determine the social and economic impact of a cervical cancer diagnosis. Additionally, interviews will be conducted to determine significant social themes around their cervical cancer diagnosis. 

IMPORTANCE: The results from this study will help identify and develop support needed for women and children affected by cervical cancer in low- and middle-income countries. This information can be used to improve cervical cancer screening programs and serve as an example for investing in the mobilization of resources to support global cervical cancer screening."

In 2022, 1 in every 8 Canadian women is expected to develop BC and 1 in 34 will die of it. Further, identifying as female is the biggest risk factor for gender-based violence (GBV; physical, psychological, or sexual violence by an intimate partner or as a child (ages 0-17)). These risk factors commonly intersect, as 42.3% of women with BC report a history of GBV and 12.5% of women experience BC and GBV concurrently. Women with BC and GBV history often experience worse health outcomes because of re-traumatization or partner interference (ex: withholding medication) during care. Unfortunately, Canadian BC practice and policy are ill-equipped to help women with GBV history - thus reinforcing health inequities - because of insufficient data about how these issues intersect.

I will answer, ""How does GBV affect the health outcomes of Canadian women with BC?"" by exploring:
1) the prevalence of GBV in this population,
2) BC differences between women with/without GBV history, &
3) lived experiences of BC related to GBV.

In collaboration with the Canadian Breast Cancer Network (the leading patient-directed Canadian non-profit for women with BC), I will lead a 1-year study including 1) a survey of ~7000 women with BC and 2) in-depth semi-structured interviews with 15-20 women with BC and GBV history. Survey analyses will identify important biological, social, and psychological differences and patterns related to BC and GBV/no GBV groups. Interview analyses will identify themes in lived experiences of BC related to GBV. A forum of 10-15 BC and GBV experts (including women with lived experience) will co-interpret findings and co-determine dissemination strategies.

I aim to produce the first Canadian evidence of the relationships between GBV and BC to identify intersections contributing to health inequities. Ultimately, this will promote equity- and trauma-informed BC care for women with GBV history."

Led by the Community Health and Wellness Committee of the Hamlet of Arviat, this 12-month project will include three phases of deliberative dialogue about ""wellness journeys"" in Aviat. The project will involve eight facilitator trainees in a train-the-trainer format. Each phase will consist of: 2-days of preparation and training; 1-day of active deliberative discussions and arts-based activities with up to 24 community members in each round; 1-day of reflection on the process and learning; and 1-day of qualitative interviews with trainees and participants. The project will build local capacity in deliberative dialogue and arts-based discussion facilitation; pilot and evaluate the use of these techniques in an Inuit context; collect and reflect on data around ""the wellness journeys"" of residents of Arviat and catalyze future research and program development."

The project, referred to as ""Bridging the Divides"", will include the development of tools and resources with the guidance and assistance of an international nutrition knowledge transcription service called Practice-based Evidence in Nutrition or PEN. The products that will be developed will be based on the identified research priorities and tailored for different users including researchers, policy makers, health professionals, as well as people with lived experience of mental illness and the individuals who support them. In addition, a website will be developed as a central hub to support all knowledge activities such as project updates, knowledge products, event listings and registration forms. The site will also host a contact database to support project communications and promote linkages among stakeholders. All of the project initiatives will be evaluated to determine the extent that new research, collaborations, products, policy actions, educational activities and practice changes were started and their successes. The products, tools, collaborations, and research that result from the Bridging the Divides project will improve population health as well as nutrition and mental health programs and services."

Although unanimous agreements have been achieved regarding CRC prevention strategies and especially screening guidelines, they are not readily used in clinical practice (China) or are suboptimal (Canada). Variance has been seen in CRC screening in ethnic populations with Chinese people in North America having the lowest screening rates as compared to Whites and African Americans. Minority and vulnerable populations (including migrants and immigrants) have been consistently found to have lower CRC screening rates.  The roles that health care policies, physicians and patients play in the early detection of CRC are critical to existing gaps and prevention targets that can be achieved. However we do not know how the three parts interact and what the most decisive factors are in determining Chinese population's CRC screening outcomes in different scenarios. As one of the world's major destination for immigrants, Canada hosts more than 1.2 million Chinese, of whom one fifth are above 50. Meanwhile, China is experiencing fast population aging and massive internal migration. Researchers in both countries have previously been working on CRC screening strategies from clinical or epidemiological perspectives for years. Despite advances made, there is still much room for improvement. This planning grant sets to bring together key researchers, clinicians, knowledge users and stakeholders from Canada and China to plan a research program that will help empirically understand how country-specific policies, practice of physicians, and patients' behaviors impact on CRC screening outcomes within Chinese populations in Canada and China. This grant will, taking migration as a unique lens, establish a forum to facilitate the identification of key research priorities, address better CRC screening practice, and develop ongoing research collaborations in both countries."

Severe maternal morbidity (SMM) refer to serious unexpected outcomes during pregnancy, or around delivery that increase a woman`s risk of dying. Even for women who survive the delivery period, SMM has significant short-term health consequences to a woman. For example, women with SMM often have increased length of hospital stay, and a greater need for admission to an intensive care unit, compared with women without SMM. However, we do not know enough about a woman's long-term health after SMM, that is, her health status after 42 days of delivery (immediate postpartum period). Some SMM, e.g. severe pre-eclampsia and obstetric hemorrhage, have been reported to increase the risk of heart disease in the mother months to years after delivery. Therefore, it is possible that SMM has long-term effects on a woman's physical and mental health. As SMM rates are rising, including in Canada, it is pertinent to understand how these conditions may impact a woman's future health. This study aims to find out if women who survive after experiencing SMM in pregnancy become ill and require more health service use, compared with women who did not have SMM in pregnancy. We will find out the most common reasons for health service use e.g. recurrent pregnancy complications, mental health and other health issues. We will also examine how these health outcomes vary by province and year. This will be the first known study to explore these issues using Canadian databases. The results from this project will help health care providers understand the risk of future health outcomes in women with SMM, and plan necessary interventions, procedures, follow-ups and resources. Overall, this research will provide information that will help to improve the health of women in Canada."

Prescription opioid misuse among at-risk youth: Investigating drug use trajectories and associated risk behaviours to inform policy responses,"['DeBeck, Kora A']","['Fischer, Benedikt', 'Kerr, Thomas H', 'Milloy, Michael-John S', 'Montaner, Julio S', 'Nosyk, Bohdan P', 'Small, William G', 'Wood, Evan']","['Addiction Treatment', 'At-Risk Youth', 'Drug Overdose', 'Epidemiology', 'Illicit Drug Use', 'Injection Initiation', 'Prescription Opioids', 'Prospective Cohort', 'Sexual Risk']",300000.0,266405,"Increasing misuse of prescription opioids among North American youth is a disturbing trend. After marijuana, prescription opioids are the most commonly misused drugs among youth. In 2007, 20.6% of Ontario high school students reported misusing prescription opioids in the past year. The negative impacts of the rising trend in prescription opioid misuse are becoming increasingly apparent. Drug poisoning is now the leading cause of death from injuries in the US, and this increase has been largely attributed to prescription opioids. There are signals that prescription opioid use among at-risk youth may promote transitions into heroin use and initiation into drug injection, drastically increasing the severity of opioid dependence and elevating the risks of experiencing other drug-related harms. Despite these concerning findings, no longitudinal evaluations of this phenomenon have taken place, and our knowledge of prescription opioid use among youth is limited to retrospective and cross-sectional studies. To address this gap, we propose to build on an existing cohort of more than 700 poly-substance using street-involved youth in Vancouver -the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS)- and recruit 200 youth who misuse prescription opioids that will be nested within the larger ARYS cohort. Our objectives are to: longitudinally monitor and evaluate trends in the availability, acquisition and use of POs among at-risk youth; evaluate the influence of PO misuse on the natural history of illicit drug use, including initiation into and cessation of injection drug use; identify and monitor risks and health impacts of PO misuse; and examine reach, coverage and impacts of policies and interventions on PO availability, use and health impacts. Our aim is to generate a body of evidence that will inform policy responses to address the crisis of prescription opioid misuse among at-risk youth."

Early in the pandemic, BC has been praised for having managed to contain the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. However, May, June and July 2020, saw record numbers of overdose deaths in BC with young people age 19-29 years consistently accounting for approximately one-in-five of all decedents from an overdose in BC. In this context, the impact of the pandemic and COVID-19 mitigation measures on street-involved youth who use drugs is largely unknown. To address this knowledge gap, we propose to build on the At-Risk Youth Study (ARYS), an established open prospective cohort of more than 1,200 street-involved youth (age 14-26) who use drugs in Vancouver, BC. At baseline and biannually participants complete a questionnaire which elicits information pertaining to behaviours and exposures occurring throughout the lifespan and in the previous six months. Using the infrastructure of the ARYS cohort, and in collaboration with Indigenous partners including the First Nations Health Authority, we propose to expand the ARYS questionnaire to include COVID-19 specific measures. Our specific objectives are to: (1) evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the illicit drug supply and associated overdose risks; (2) investigate the impact of COVID-19 on access and engagement with overdose prevention interventions; and (3) evaluate the influence of COVID-19 clinical risk mitigation interventions on long-term trajectories of addiction treatment engagement and subsequent drug use patterns.

Phthalates are widely used as additives in plastics and consumer products, including food packaging, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, building materials, and textiles. Phthalates are readily absorbed through the skin or inhaled, and biological monitoring studies have detected universal exposure to phthalates in the urine of children and adults in the general population of Canada.

Mechanistic studies in cells and experimental animals have provided growing evidence that phthalates exhibit key characteristics of carcinogens, with endocrine-disrupting effects of particular concern for hormone related cancers of the breast and prostate. However, epidemiological studies of phthalate exposure and cancer risk in humans are few and have been limited in their exposure assessment and ability to follow people for cancer diagnoses.

The proposed research aims to address the critical lack of human evidence on phthalate exposure and breast and prostate cancer risk. The main objective is to conduct an epidemiological cohort study to estimate the association between urinary concentrations of phthalate biomarkers and breast and prostate cancer incidence in an existing national cohort of male and female adults in Canada. Further, we aim to identify lifestyle, medical, and employment factors associated with biological phthalate exposure, and to estimate associations between employment in highly exposed occupations and breast and prostate cancer risk to evaluate proxies of long-term exposure to phthalates.

Results will advance understandings of the carcinogenic hazards of phthalates and identify opportunities for breast and prostate cancer prevention. Knowledge users from governmental research and occupational health organizations will translate results to stakeholders and workers to reach vulnerable populations with high levels of exposure."

My specific aims are:
1.To develop a large program of epidemiological research on understanding broad sexual and reproductive health needs as well as key factors shaping HIV prevention, treatment and care for women living with and affected by HIV/AIDS. 
2.To expand an epidemiological research program based on the development and use of advanced statistical, mathematical and spatial methodological approaches in research on women living with and affected by HIV/AIDS, including establishing a platform for the research training of students and postdoctoral fellows. 
The setting for the majority of this research program is Metropolitan Vancouver, Canada. In joining the Department of Medicine at UBC as faculty, I will bring strong methodological and research innovation, spanning infectious disease epidemiology, HIV prevention and treatment, and monitoring and evaluation of large-scale population-level interventions both in Canada and globally. The proposed research program directly addresses global calls for a research agenda on women and HIV. This program will provide valuable, policy-relevant information and enable policy and programmatic responses tailored to the needs of women living with and affected by HIV/AIDS. Moreover, this program will develop and use a number of novel analytic techniques that are under-used in research with women living with and affected by HIV/AIDS, but which are well-suited to take into account the complex pathways and dynamics that shape HIV prevention, treatment and care."

Therefore, in the proposed fellowship project I aim to investigate the intersecting relationships between neighbourhood and sex work environment at the macro level and the distribution of individual sexual HIV/STI risk patterns and access to health services among a sample of sex industry workers in an urban Canadian setting (Metropolitan Vancouver). This project is part of a larger study, a five-year longitudinal cohort of women in sex industry work in Metropolitan Vancouver that began enrolment in Jan-10, in partnership with local sex work and service agencies. Women will be followed up every six months over five years through interviews. I will use empirical data gathered in the larger project, and combine advanced social epidemiology methods and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping technology, developing a GIS database. I will also explore the use of novel complex adaptive systems approaches and develop a unique model that incorporates factors at multiple levels of influence, including social, structural and environmental, in understanding how neighbourhood environment impacts sexual risk patterns and health services access. The results from the research conducted during this fellowship will be exceedingly important in informing the ongoing development of health policy and structural interventions that improve the health of women involved in sex industry work in Canadian settings and will support ongoing knowledge translation of evidence into policy and practice through our extensive community partnerships."

Persistent gaps exist in science and interventions to address gender disparities in HIV treatment and care continue to exist, with women falling behind men in all HIV clinical outcomes in BC. WLWH also experience high levels of violence and HIV stigma throughout their lifetimes, which has been linked to reduced HIV and broader healthcare access. There is limited data characterizing co-occurring harms of  violence and stigma on HIV outcomes. Global calls exist to incorporate 'trauma- and violence-informed care' principles into HIV care and practice to address these barriers, but limited research exists to understand how this can be done, and how to tailor these programs to meet the needs of marginalized groups including Indigenous women and women identifying as gender and sexual minority people. Leveraging phase I cohort of 350 cis and trans WLWH in a Metro Vancouver, Canada (Sexual Health and HIV/AIDS: Women's Longitudinal Needs Assessment (SHAWNA)), funded by CIHR (2015-2019), we have the unique opportunity to refresh and extend this cohort to 500 WLWH to inform programs and interventions designed with and for WLWH. This study brings an established interdisciplinary team, including social scientists, epidemiologists and clinical researchers, together with knowledge users and collaborators, representing community experts, to examine how violence and HIV stigma shapes WLWH's access to HIV treatment and care. Our study offers an unprecedented opportunity to create an evidence base to understand how to mitigate violence and stigma impacts on HIV treatment and care outcomes. Knowledge translation and exchange will be conducted throughout the study, playing a key role in informing policy and programs that promote trauma- and violence-informed HIV practice for WLWH in BC, and can be replicated across Canada."

In study #1, participants will perform three postural transitions: (a) sit-to-stand, (b) lie-to-stand, and (c) lie-to-sit, and three identical constant workload walking tests. The autonomic (brain, e.g., sympathetic and parasympathetic activity), cardiovascular (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac output), and respiratory (e.g., oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide output, ventilation) will be assessed in females and males with different frailty statuses. In study #2, frail individuals will perform 15 weeks of progressive strength or aerobic training to determine how exercise can reverse frailty and improve autonomic, cardiovascular, and respiratory function. Homeostatic dysregulation compromises rapid adjustments in the autonomic, cardiovascular, and respiratory regulatory mechanisms affecting maintenance of homeostasis, especially in vulnerable populations (e.g., older adults). The dysregulation exposes them to higher risks of frailty, chronic diseases, and falls. Frailty is characterized by the degradation of biological and functional reserves to tolerate stressors resulting in high vulnerability to adverse health outcomes. People living with frailty are under-recognized, under-served, under-appreciated, and poorly understood. This research proposal is critical because it will inform the future development of more robust early frailty risk detection assessments, frailty preventative, and rehabilitative treatment/intervention strategies considering sex differences. Advancements in the fundamental knowledge of the underlying mechanisms regulating autonomic, cardiovascular, and respiratory responses will inform how to promote health, well-being, and quality of life for females and males living with frailty."
Transformation sociale des technologies médicales en développement : la participation des usagers dans les processus d'innovation en santé,"['Demers-Payette, Olivier']",['N/A'],"['Changement Technologique', 'Implication Des Usagers', 'Organisation Des Soins De Santé', ""Processus D'Innovation"", 'Recherche Qualitative', 'Santé Des Populations', 'Transfert De Connaissances']",105000.0,184497,"Les changements technologiques ont des effets structurants majeurs sur l'organisation des soins dans notre système de santé et affectent l'ensemble de ses acteurs : organisations, gestionnaires, professionnels, patients et société en générale. En outre, les processus d'innovation des technologies médicales sont complexes et mal compris. La mobilisation des acteurs du système de santé dans le développement technologique s'avère essentielle afin de faire converger les objectifs économiques du secteur privé et les objectifs sanitaires et curatifs du système public de santé. L'implication des usagers dans l'élaboration des innovations en santé se révèle cruciale pour aligner les besoins de chacun et anticiper les effets sociaux des technologies. Pourtant, cette participation varie considérablement et semble peu structurée. C'est pourquoi il est nécessaire de mieux comprendre les processus d'innovation en santé et l'impact de la participation des usagers sur la transformation de ces pratiques. Ce projet de recherche propose d'examiner comment des compagnies oeuvrant dans le domaine des technologies médicales impliquent le point de vue des usagers (patients et professionnels de la santé) dans le processus d'innovation. Il s'agit d'une étude de plusieurs cas comparant différents mécanismes d'implication des usagers. Ce projet emprunte une démarche méthodologique de type qualitatif: 1) analyse documentaire; 2) entrevues; et 3) groupes de discussion. Cette recherche permettra de saisir plus finement le phénomène complexe de la participation des usagers dans les processus d'innovation et de mieux comprendre comment les valeurs et les préférences de chacun gouvernent le développement de nouvelles technologies. Ce faisant, il offrira de nouvelles perspectives aux décideurs, à l'industrie et aux usagers pour aligner plus efficacement les processus d'innovation médicale avec les objectifs du système de santé."

Par ailleurs, la preuve des bénéfices sur la santé de caractéristiques résidentielles favorables, favorisant l'activité physique, est croissante. 
Une étude cas-témoins fut conduite dans le Grand Montréal. 1933 cas de cancer de la prostate âgés de moins de 76 ans, diagnostiqués dans les hôpitaux francophones entre 2005 et 2009 ont été identifiés et appariés par âge à 1994 témoins, non diagnostiqués d'un cancer de la prostate, sélectionnés dans les listes électorales. Les habitudes de vie et l'histoire résidentielle des sujets ont été collectées lors d'entrevues individuelles. Leurs adresses ont été géocodées et liées à un indice de « marchabilité » disponible pour l'environnement proche des résidences. Cet indice prend en compte le type d'utilisation de l'environnement (résidentiel, commercial, institutionnel) et son niveau d'hétérogénéité, la densité d'habitations et le nombre d'intersections de routes.
Le risque de développer un cancer de la prostate agressif ou non agressif a été estimé par régression en tenant compte de l'âge,  de l'ethnie, de l'histoire familiale de cancer et de caractéristiques individuelles telles le niveau d'éducation et l'activité physique, ainsi que de caractéristiques matérielles et sociales de l'entourage géographique. Comparés aux hommes vivant dans un environnement où la «marchabilité » est faible, les hommes dans un environnement de «marchabilité » élevée ont un risque de cancer de la prostate agressif 1.24 fois plus élevé. 
De futures analyses permettront d'évaluer le potentiel de confusion expliquant cette association « inattendue ». Les résultats de cette étude contribueront à mieux comprendre l'étiologie du cancer de la prostate, qui demeure largement inconnue."

The last two decades have seen a steady growth in research studies on the accuracy of rapid tests for TB screening in vulnerable populations. Systematic reviews and accompanying meta-analyses have played a key role in synthesizing the results of this diverse literature. They have aided in directing medical research towards more promising technologies, and also in identifying failed technologies that have proved detrimental to public health.  The last decade has also seen a growing recognition of the need for more sophisticated statistical modeling to support meta-analyses. This proposal describes development of new tools to improve meta-analyses of tuberculosis diagnostic studies. Building on our earlier work in this area, we propose methods for addressing three principal concerns: i) Quantifying and modeling variation across diagnostic studies, ii)Studying the impact of common biases in diagnostic studies, and iii) Estimation of the incremental value of a new test over and above a standard test. Our methods will be applied toe data from published meta-analyses of TB tests. We anticipate that our research will lead to improved methods for evaluating available evidence and aid in policy making. For all models we will develop user-friendly software to permit easy application. The methods we propose will also find application in areas besides tuberculosis where diagnostic meta-analyses are needed."

While the cause of PPD remains unclear, recent research suggests recent immigrant status is an important predictor. The purpose of this longitudinal study is three-fold: (1) to determine the prevalence of PPD, when it started, and whether the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) is a good way to assess for PPD among recent immigrant Chinese mothers; (2) to examine the relationships between recent immigrant status, PPD, acculturation, acculturative stress, social  support, income, and the practice of traditional postpartum rituals; and (3) to determine patterns of PPD help-seeking behaviours and barriers to health services among recent immigrant Chinese mothers. Following a comprehensive recruitment program, eligible and consenting mothers will receive follow-up calls by trained research assistants matched on maternal language ability. Diverse study outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 12, 24, and 52 weeks postpartum. The study results will make substantive contributions in seven areas: (1) provide information about PPD prevalence rates among recently immigrated and Canadian-born Chinese women; (2) establish the validity of using the EPDS in detecting PPD among these Chinese mothers; (3) advance our understanding of the relationship between recent immigrant status, the acculturation process, and PPD; (4) determine which traditional postpartum rituals are maintained post-migration and the effect of these practices on the development of PPD; (5) investigate health service utilization barriers and help-seeking behaviours related to PPD; (6) promote cultural sensitivity among health professionals; and (7) guide the development of a future randomized controlled trial."

accompanied by depression or anxiety and is considered by some to psychosomatic. Recent observations show that acute
gastroenteritis can trigger IBS and that this may result in changes in the bacterial population that resides in the gut - known
as flora. In this proposal, we will investigate whether changes in gut flora contribute to the expression of IBS using a mouse
model. We have already shown that perturbing gut flora produces changes bowel function. As psychiatric conditions often
accompany IBS, we will investigate whether the gut flora influence the brain and change behavior. The proposal uses
molecular tools to identify gut bacteria and experiments are undertaken in a unique germ free laboratory to minimize
contamination. If we succeed in showing that gut flora influence both gut function and behavior, then it will be possible to
develop a single treatment strategy to treat all aspects of this condition."

However, few studies have studied whether this is also the case for socioeconomic outcomes, such as attendance of university, individual income, and being on social assistance. Using survey data and tax records from Canada and appropriate statistical methods, this work will study whether children of depressed mothers are more likely to not attend university, have lower income and/or receive social assistance when they are adults and how this occurs. Special attention will be paid to whether there are differences by children's sex and race/ethnicity, mothers' socioeconomic status (income, education), household type (single vs. two-parent households; single child vs. presence of siblings), and frequency of periods of depression among mothers. This work will be important to inform the design of interventions that target mothers' mental health as well as children's health and development."

Though it was long considered a disease among older adults, it is now frequently striking in younger adults who are diagnosed at less than 50 years of age. With this increased risk of young-onset colorectal cancer (yCRC) comes the need to understand its impacts on patients at a unique stage in their lives.  In particular, with younger patients more likely to be of reproductive age and yCRC being a cancer ""below the waist"", it is important to understand its impacts on reproductive health.  

We will expand on our current research on yCRC through the use of ""big"" healthcare data in the province of British Columbia. This includes information on all doctors' visits, hospitalizations, prescription medications, and diagnosed cancers. Using this data, we will study reproductive health outcomes of female patients with yCRC including pregnancy outcomes of mother and baby.

The goal of our project is to gain a better understanding of reproductive and sexual health among AYA cancer patients. Because of the complex nature of this topic and the unique patient population of younger adults, we will use multiple research methods. First, we will analyze ""big"" health care data including cancer and pregnancy registry data. Second, we will hold focus groups with AYA cancer patients to gather their experiences with reproductive and sexual health during and after treatment. Altogether, this project represents the start of meaningful and inclusive conversations about reproductive and sexual health among AYA cancer patients. It also provides a safe space for these sensitive topics, often associated with stigma or taboo, which have major impacts on AYA cancer patients' quality of life.

Worldwide, over 200 million major noncardiac surgeries occur annually, and in Canada 500,000 adults undergo such surgery every year.  We, however, do not know how many major vascular complications - such as heart attacks, cardiac arrests, strokes, or death from these causes - occur when patients have surgery, and we do not know the best way to estimate a patient's risk of such complications.  Further, we do not know if a simple blood test after surgery will help doctors to avoid missing heart attacks after surgery and predict a patient's risk of death at 1 year after surgery.  We will undertake a study to address these issues.  

Our study will determine: how many patients have a major vascular complication (i.e., heart attack, cardiac arrest, stroke, or death from these causes) within 30 days of surgery; the best method to predict these complications; how many patients have a heart attack after surgery without symptoms; and if these heart attacks affect patient health over the following year.  Knowing the current number of major vascular complications after surgery will inform decision makers about the resources required to confront this problem; and knowing the best method to estimate a patient's risk of such a complication around the time of surgery will allow patients and physicians to make informed decisions about the appropriateness of surgery.  Finally if a simple blood test after surgery can identify heart attacks that would go unrecognized and predict major vascular events at 1 year this will allow physicians to provide appropriate timely treatments to help these patients survive to enjoy the benefits of their surgery."

Using concept mapping to create responsive cervical cancer screening knowledge translation and exchange for South Asian women who are under- or never screened in Ontario,"['Devotta, Kimberly']",['N/A'],"['Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Concept Mapping', 'Health Inequities', 'Intersectionality Theory', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Newcomer/Immigrant Health', 'South Asian Women', 'Tailored Communication']",105000.0,417315,"With regular screening, cervical cancer is preventable for women living in Canada.  Organized programs exist at the provincial level to make this screening (i.e. Pap tests) available to women, and some groups have noticeably lower participation rates. In Ontario, around 60-65% of women get screened but this falls short of the province's aim of 85%. 

In particular, South Asian women have the lowest rates of cervical cancer screening among major ethnic groups and a suggested higher burden of cervical cancer, in Ontario. This is due to a number of reasons such as access to a physician, cultural barriers and indirect costs. Additionally, misconceptions and misinformation have also played a role and work in this area has shown the need for more tailored communication strategies. 

Understanding the knowledge and beliefs of these under- or never screened women, can allow us to create health education materials that speak to their information needs and communicate in different ways. This study will first review the available cervical cancer screening communications and research that exists in this area. Then we will work with women who identify as part of this group, to map out their ideas and opinions around cervical cancer screening to see how it differs from mainstream communications. Lastly, we will work in collaboration with the women in the study to create cervical cancer screening communications to reflect their input in the process. 

This work will contribute to an underexplored area and work in line with current priorities of Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) to increase screening rates for populations with low participation rates. It also responds to a research priority of CIHR's Institute of Cancer Research to support intervention research including knowledge translation into practice and policies in reponse to inequities in prevention services."

Prenatal exposure to chemicals in plastics, specifically phthalates, is substantial due to their widespread use in food packaging, household cleaners, cosmetics and personal care products. Phthalates can cross the placenta and affect the activity of genes critical for brain development. This in turn could influence the development of children's thinking and reasoning abilities and behaviour. Prenatal exposure to phthalates has been associated with adverse effects on children's development, including lower levels of intelligence, poorer motor and language skills and a higher risk for autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The effect of phthalates on genes is poorly understood and may be different for girls and boys. This could explain the greater proportion of boys who are diagnosed with developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Our team is comprised of researchers with expertise in child development, epigenetics, environmental toxicology and public health. We will use already collected data on mother's prenatal exposure to phthalate chemicals and children's cognitive, motor and behavioural outcomes at 2, 3-4 and 5-9 years of age. This data comes from two studies that recruited women during pregnancy, one in Canada and the other in Australia. These studies have biobanked DNA samples that will be used to identify genes that change due to phthalate exposure. We will investigate the relationship between these genes and intelligence, language and motor skills, and behaviour in girls and boys. Our results could be used to update recommendations on exposure to chemicals in plastics during pregnancy. They could also be used to design interventions to prevent or reverse the potential negative effects of exposure to these plastic chemicals on children's brains and behaviour."

A Bayesian Approach to Understanding Mental Health Burden and Service Utilization among Sexual Minority Men in Canada,"['Dharma, Christoffer']",['N/A'],"['Bayesian', 'Epidemiology', 'Health Services', 'Machine Learning', 'Men Who Have Sex With Men', 'Mental Health', 'Sexuality']",105000.0,458353,"Sexual minority men, which are gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men, experience a high mental health burden due to societal stigma. However, our understanding remains limited due to challenges in recruitment and sampling. Population surveys from Statistics Canada are representative of 97% of Canadians, but up to 60% of sexual minority men have reported that they would not report their sexual orientation to a government employee. Linking these surveys to hospital records is another common way to identify mental health problems, although this would be missing out on those who do not seek care. Among sexual minorities in particular, this is compounded by the fact that many may choose not to seek care due to fear of discrimination, past negative experiences in the healthcare system, or lack of cultural competence from providers. Community-based surveys that are conducted by groups of sexual minorities could have fewer misclassification and underreporting biases, however, these will only capture those sexual minorities who are the most connected to the community. To remedy these issues, this thesis will propose the use a Bayesian approach, an alternative statistical method that will allow us to combine strengths and weaknesses of different datasets to produce more accurate estimates. Using this same approach, we will also calculate individual risk scores to predict improvement in mental health through factors such as seeking care, social support, outness, and resilience using community-based and population-based surveys. Building risk scores for mental health improvement among sexual minority men will help individuals to make more informed decisions regarding their care, especially in situations where care is not easily accessible (e.g., during pandemic times). It also allows public health practitioners to better target groups who need help. These methods can potentially be used in other hard to reach populations, which will improve future studies."

En Côte d'Ivoire, c'est la 3e cause de décès chez les femmes et les hommes. Il est dû à des types cancérigènes du virus du papillome humain (VPH) qui se transmet souvent lors des rapports sexuels. La vaccination cible donc les jeunes filles dès 9 ans, avant le début de l'activité sexuelle. Il y a trois types de vaccins: 2-valent pour les VPH 16-18; 4-valent pour les 16-18-6-11; et 9-valent pour les 16-18-31-33-45-52-58-6-11.

Notre étude vise à combler ce déficit de connaissances en comparant les VPH cancérigènes retrouvés chez 1 000 jeunes filles vaccinées à ceux de 1 000 jeunes filles non vaccinées qui seront recrutées dans des écoles. Les jeunes filles éligibles à l'étude (avoir eu 9 à13 ans en 2013-2016 et avoir été scolarisée dans l'une des cinq localités du projet pilote) qui accepteront de participer répondront à un questionnaire et fourniront, chacune, un prélèvement vaginal fait par elle-même. Celui-ci servira à identifier les VPH cancérigènes et à comparer leurs fréquences entre les jeunes filles vaccinées et les non vaccinées. L'on s'attend à ce que la fréquence soit nettement inférieure chez les vaccinées comparativement aux non vaccinées. Dans le cas contraire, lors de la vaccination de masse, le vaccin 4-valent pourrait être remplacé par le 9-valent qui cible plus de types cancérigènes parmi ceux circulant en Côte d'Ivoire et ailleurs en Afrique au sud du Sahara."

La recherche sur le changement climatique et la santé est en progression. L'objectif de ce projet est triple :

1)Utiliser une approche méthodologique novatrice, l'évaluation d'impact sur la santé, pour évaluer les bénéfices et les risques potentiels pour la santé des stratégies de réduction des émissions de GES prises par les autorités locales d'une ville du Canada telle que Québec, Montréal ou Toronto.
2)Favoriser la collaboration intersectorielle dans la protection du climat et la promotion de la santé.
3)Montrer aux décideurs et aux professionnels des différents secteurs concernés par la lutte contre le changement climatique, que la prise en compte de la dimension santé pourrait contribuer à développer ou soutenir des politiques d'atténuation de ce phénomène.

Dans le contexte où le droit à la santé figure dans le préambule de l'accord de Paris sur le climat de 2015, les villes qui sont responsables de la majorité des émissions de GES, ont un rôle de premier plan à jouer dans la lutte contre le changement climatique qui pourrait induire des co-bénéfices pour la santé."

I will use socio-critical theory and an environmental and social determinants of health framework so as not to privilege human over animal or environmental health. I will use visual-narrative qualitative methods to explore the experiences, affects, and perceptions of the public and public health leadership, providers, and scientists about communicable disease and climate change. I will also explore relationships and points of (con/di)vergence between these topics and populations. This research is in alignment with several public health priorities and will be important for interdisciplinary policymakers and providers who are simultaneously juggling the tasks of pandemic recovery and the ever-present threat of climate change and its' health-related outcomes. It is novel in its' drawing upon sociocritical theory and will be the first to use arts-based methods to explore vaccination, climate action, and trust in science."

Funded through multiple sources (e.g., federal funds, the provincial home support program, private donations) Stella's Circle has maintained clients, who may have been otherwise homeless, in stable supportive housing rather than institutions. However, a noticeable trend among its clientele has been identified, namely, that the clients (tenants) are aging and their physical and mental health is declining. Through a research study, it was evident that tenants were experiencing physical challenges limiting their mobility which exacerbated their mental health issues (Hanrahan, 2017). As well, tenants had tenuous connections with their families of origin, and placed high value in the connections that they had within Stella's Circle and wished to age in this community (i.e., the Stella's Circle community). Further, as tenants age, Stella's Circle has encountered a gap in the community care system, and the personal care home sector which has limited capacity to work with this clientele. The proposed research is to explore a new model of housing that will identify staff models, skills, and physical infrastructure necessary to help this cohort of older adults with complex mental health issues. Ultimately, this cohort will 'age in place' in their home in their community."
Application for a Travel Bursary to attend the Institute of Population and Public Health Starting Investigators Workshop,"['DiLiberto, Deborah']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1347.0,400368,"My current research examines health worker dilemmas and decision-making in humanitarian emergencies. In particular, my research focuses on the multifaceted set of clinical, social and operational challenges that arise in these complex settings and almost immediately become daily and significant dilemmas for local health workers on the frontlines of service delivery. Unlike their expatriate counterparts, local health workers have minimal training on emergency preparedness and response, yet they face overwhelming circumstances when emergencies strike including limited supplies and equipment, increased workload and long working days, lack of pay, dangerous transportation and working conditions, and disconnection from social and professional support systems. How health workers navigate these everyday challenges has been demonstrated as critical to the provision of quality care which ultimately affects health outcomes, but has received inadequate attention. If left unaddressed, these challenges can erode the skills, motivation and retention of local health workers leading to ineffective health care services and exacerbating the already poor health outcomes characteristic of these settings. Working in South Sudan and Rwanda, my research aims to produce evidence of local health workers' dilemmas and decision-making experiences in humanitarian emergencies to inform the design and evaluation of  locally-responsive interventions that support the provision of quality essential health care during difficult times and in marginalized areas. Taking an interdisciplinary and participatory approach, I am employing a mix of anthropological and epidemiological methods to incorporate and feature the complexity of the context and health workers' dilemmas into the design and evaluation of the intervention. This research will contribute to the increasing emphasis for evidence to inform policymaking on human resource development and health systems strengthening in humanitarian emergencies."
The Partnership for Adolescent Sexual and Reproductive Health Research in Humanitarian Emergencies: Establishing Research Priorities and Partnership Plans,"['DiLiberto, Deborah']",['N/A'],"['Equity', 'Evidence For Health Policy', 'Global Health', 'Global Health Emergencies']",19946.0,412348,"Our proposed partnership aims to identify research questions and projects that will contribute to improving sexual and reproductive health (SRH) for refugee and internally displaced adolescent girls in humanitarian crises. We have proposed two meetings as the first step to creating a partnership of Canadian and Colombian colleagues working together to develop research questions and projects on this topic. 

We are focusing on adolescent girls in Bogota, Colombia. We know that Colombia's health system is over-stretched due to the many refugee and internally displaced adolescents living in Bogota due to the crisis in Venezuela and Colombia's history of insecurity and violence. We also know that adolescent girls face many SRH risks and that addressing their health needs results in positive outcomes for themselves and society. But more research is needed to identify the best solutions to improving care.

Our meetings will include researchers, representatives from local government, non-governmental and civil society organizations, and citizens working together. We will have two meetings of 3 days each in Bogota, Colombia. In the first meeting, we will share information on problems affecting SRH for refugee and internally displaced adolescent girls in Bogotá, the methods we can use to ask questions about these problems, and plans to develop the Partnership. In the second meeting, we will visit El Codito, a neighbourgood in Bogota where many refugee and internally displaced adolescent girls live. We will visit places providing health care and talk with adolescent girls. By the end of the meetings, we will have decided the focus of our research, the research projects we will develop, and how to support the Partnership. 

We believe the meetings will help us build an effective Partnership that will contribute important information for improving SRH for refugee and internally displaced adolescent girls in humanitarian crises that can apply to many places in the world."
Addressing the COVID-19/malaria interface at health centres in the Democratic Republic of Congo,"['DiLiberto, Deborah']","['Banek, Kristin E', 'Baumann, Andrea', 'Kashamuka, Melchior M', 'Tshefu, Antoinette']","['Africa', 'Case Management', 'Covid-19', 'Democratic Republic Of Congo', 'Health Centres', 'Health Workers', 'Knowledge, Attitudes, Behaviours', 'Malaria']",260000.0,465289,"With the COVID-19 pandemic jeopardizing two decades of progress against malaria in Africa, approaches to supporting health workers on the frontlines of managing both diseases are urgently needed. Health workers are responsible for the management of both COVID-19 and malaria, while also being at greater risk of COVID-19 infection and onward transmission through their close contact with patients. Their work is complicated by the symptom overlap between COVID-19 and malaria which complicates diagnosis and treatment resulting in an increased risk of poor health outcomes. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is at risk for poor outcomes related to COVID-19 and malaria. DRC has the second-highest burden of malaria worldwide and accounts for 12% of malaria cases and 13% of malaria deaths worldwide. Less than 1% of the population has been fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Insights into health workers' changing knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours towards both diseases is lacking but essential to tackling the COVID-19/malaria interface. This research will make recommendations to address the COVID-19/malaria interface at health centers in Kinshasa, DRC. We will collect data from health workers at six health centres in Kinshasa Province using questionnaires and focus group discussions (FGD). The questionnaires will provide quantitative data identifying the barriers and drivers for taking up recommended COVID-19 control behaviours and managing the COVID-19/malaria case-mix. The FGDs will gather health workers' perspectives on their recommended solutions to the challenges to COVID-19/malaria control and case management that can be implemented at health centres. This study will produce recommendations for improving the role health workers can play in making progress against both COVID-19 and malaria.  These outcomes will equip policy and decision makers with the knowledge needed to address the intersection of pandemic response and endemic disease management."
A Longitudinal Analysis of Caregiver Emotional Availability During Routine Infant Immunizations: The Roles of Infant And Maternal Variables.,"['Din Osmun, Laila']",['N/A'],"['Caregiver Behaviors', 'Caregiver Emotional Availability', 'Caregiver Sensitivity', 'Culture', 'Developmental Trajectories', 'Infant Pain', 'Infant Temperament', 'Longitudinal Analyses', 'Multilevel Models', 'Risk Factors']",105000.0,184498,"Unrelieved and poorly managed infant pain can have detrimental effects on infant development (Anand, Grunau, & Oberlander, 1997). In order to avoid these deleterious outcomes, it is imperative to understand how different factors can influence infant pain distress and regulation over time. Several studies have pointed to the fact that caregiving behaviors, such as sensitive and emotionally available caregiving, are linked to lower pain expressions and faster distress regulation during painful procedures such as routine immunizations (e.g. Axia & Bonichini, 2005; Din, Pillai Riddell & Gordner, in press). Despite the important role caregiver behaviors play in infant pain related distress and regulation, no studies to date have attempted to investigate the risk factors for suboptimal caregiving behaviors during painful events or have examined the developmental trajectories of caregiving behaviors during painful procedures. The goal of this study is to investigate risk factors for suboptimal caregiving behaviors during routine infant immunizations over the first year of life. The roles that infant variables (e.g. temperament, gender, health) as well as caregiver variables (e.g. social stressors (i.e. age, education, number of children at home, perceived social stress), ethnicity, and gender) play on caregiver interactive behavior during infant immunizations will be observed. The impact of these infant and caregiver variables on the developmental trajectories of caregiver interactive behavior will be explored. It is hoped that the results from this study will help inform the practice of infant mental health by providing longitudinal and developmental data pertaining to the risk factors for suboptimal caregiving quality during distressing situations over the infant's first year of life. As such, it is believed that this study will have important clinical implications for interventions designed at improving the quality of caregiver-infant interactions in at risk families."

Being able to identify early on those patients who are most likely to sustain long-term, significant disability would thus favor better treatment (the right patients referred earlier to the right interventions) among severe cases while helping to reduce the costs and adverse consequences of unnecessary treatment of milder cases. A classification tool that was developed and validated in the past 10 years to achieve this goal (the ""Cassandra Rule"") will be further studied in this project, that aims at examining how the availability of this tool to physicians impacts on the process that determines the long-term clinical and economical outcomes of back pain. Since there are currently no simple means to identify patients at high risk of chronicity in primary care settings, the results of this study could have important implications for a more efficient management of back pain problems. This study will also provide for the first time estimates of the direct cost of back pain in the general population."

However, recent data indicate that this protective effect on breast cancer risk may be limited to postmenopausal obese women. Possible explanations for this protective effect might come from reduced inflammation, decreased estrogenic activity and improved insulin sensitivity in the breast of obese women but have yet to be confirmed. For the first time, Dr. Diorio's team proposes to examine these obesity-related markers in all components of the breast and with levels of omega-3 fatty acids in fatty breast tissues. The research team will show that these obesity-related markers are linked to breast cancer risk by looking at their effects on breast density, an indicator of breast cancer risk. Looking at changes in breast density is a unique approach, and the best way, to examine if omega-3 fatty acids offer protection against cancer, and so will help to accelerate research. A better understanding of how omega-3s interact with obesity markers in the breast will provide clues as to why the protective effect may be limited to obese women. Our findings will provide mechanistic insights that will help support the design of clinical trials and open the door for testing omega-3s as an approach to reducing breast cancer incidence."

EAs are interested in mental health services, but there are limited available options and long-wait times on campuses. Brief mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) have been suggested as an efficacious method for reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression. MBI treatment effects (improved mental health and wellbeing) may also be explained by augmented self-compassion. Although, there is limited research to support the intervention efficacy and the mechanisms of change in EA populations. The proposed randomized control trial study will consider the efficacy of a brief MBI for EAs at York University, by comparing self-report mental health and wellbeing outcomes of the intervention (55 brief mindfulness participants) to a placebo-control group (55 mindfulness app participants). Based off my masters brief MBI research, this study hypothesizes (1) that a 5-week, brief MBI reduces mental health difficulties, and improves well-being in the short-term (immediately before session 3 and immediately after session 5) and in the long-term (3-, 6- and 12-months following the intervention completion) and (2) that the intervention effects (reduction in depression, anxiety, and improved wellbeing) are explained by augmented self-compassion. If an efficacious intervention, the proposed research study (1) could lead to a brief, evidence-based solution to improve the mental health and wellbeing of post-secondary EAs, that aligns with York Universities goal of Building Healthy Lives, Communities and Environment, (2) provide support for cultivating self-compassion in mental health-focused interventions for EA populations and 3) could result in dissemination of EA post-secondary student mental health knowledge nationally and internationally."

At the same time, poor employment and low-income levels may impact or exacerbate a mental illness and the ability to access treatment. In Canada, we know little about what employment and income look like for Canadians with these disorders over time. This evidence is a necessary first step to identifying the most appropriate time to intervene with health and labour interventions to retain these Canadians in work.

The goals of this project are to: 1) uncover the trajectories of employment and income among Canadian males and females between the ages of 18 to 64 who experience a common mental disorder (anxiety disorders, depressive disorder), severe mental disorder (bipolar disorder, schizophrenia), eating disorders, substance use disorders, or multiple disorders; 2) determine which sociodemographic and health factors most strongly influence trajectory membership for each mental disorder group; and 3) compare these trajectories to those of working-aged Canadians who do not experience mental or substance use disorders. 

We will use the 2002 and 2012 national, mental health-focused Canadian Community Health Survey cycles linked to annual administrative tax records from 1993 to 2017, providing an objective measurement of employment, earnings, and income. Growth mixture modeling will identify the shape of employment and income trajectories and how many exist for each sex experiencing each mental and substance use disorder. The association between trajectory membership and sociodemographic/health-related profile will be studied using multinomial logistic regression. After comparing these trajectories to Canadians without a mental disorder, this study will be able to quantify the difference in income attainment of Canadians with mental disorders and uncover differences in employment stability over the prime working years."
"Emergency contraception in Albania: A multi-methods qualitative study of awareness, knowledge, attitudes, and practices","['Doci, Florida']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,383063,"Objective(s): 
At 11%, the contraceptive prevalence rate with modern methods is relatively low in Albania, even though an array of methods are freely available. Abortion remains the mainstay of family planning in the country. Emergency contraception (EC) could play a significant role in addressing women's need for an effective and discreet method of pregnancy prevention. Although two different levonorgestrel-only EC pills (NorLevo and Postinor) are available directly from pharmacies, use remains limited. This study aimed to explore awareness, knowledge, attitudes, and practices toward EC in Albania.
Design and methods: 
In 2016, we conducted a multi-methods qualitative study with women and service providers in Albania. We invited women to report on their knowledge of, attitudes toward, and practices surrounding EC in an online survey and through six focus group discussions. Additionally, we conducted 19 in-depth semi-structured interviews with key informants and 16 structured interviews with retail pharmacists in Tirana. We analysed our data using descriptive statistics and for content and themes.
Results: 
Our findings suggest that EC is widely available in pharmacies in Albania. However, women face numerous barriers to accessing this form of contraception. Lack of knowledge among providers and women, misconceptions about hormonal contraceptives, misinformation about the side effects of and risks associated with EC, lack of public sector provision, and stigma and fear of judgment among women pose obstacles to timely access.
Conclusions: 
Misinformation about EC among women and providers in Albania appears common. Training of health service providers, raising awareness among women, and developing Albanian-language and culturally resonant materials for distribution could play a key role in improving knowledge and uptake of EC."

Seasonal migration represents one response by some households in this context to address cycles of poverty and malnutrition.  It is often assumed that income generated from seasonal migration can be used by the household to purchase necessities for individual and household survival, including food.  However, there is a lack of consensus or empirical data regarding the actual financial and nutritional benefits and costs of seasonal labour mobility in Tamil Nadu.  The hypothesis of this research is a household's participation in seasonal migration is associated with measurable changes in maternal and child nutrition in several rural communities in central Tamil Nadu.  This hypothesis will be tested through tracking the nutrition and dietary intake of mothers and their children who are members of migrant households for one year in order to observe any changes in nutritional status.  The collection of anthropometric data, dietary recalls, along with qualitative interviews and focus groups will be used as the primary methodological tools."

The research question that this project will address is how do patterns of seasonal labour migration impact the health status of different members of migrant households who are small-scale rural farmers in the Krishnagiri district of Tamil Nadu, India. More specifically, this project has three overarching objectives which are to investigate the impact of seasonal labour migration on the overall health status of individual migrants; to examine how seasonal labour migration impacts the overall health statuses of household members who do not seasonally migrate; and to describe the major health problems that constrain agricultural production and community development in this setting. This project will elicit participation from community members in its design and implementation and use several methods including interviews, focus groups, and surveys. Beyond filling several gaps in the academic literature, this project has a strong applied orientation and policy focus. A stronger understanding of the connections among seasonal labour migration, health, and agricultural production is a critical step in the development of improved health policy, food security policy, and inclusive social policy that grasps the complexity of seasonal labour migration in this context and in other areas throughout South Asia.  For these reasons, this study clearly connects to the mandate of CIHR to promote research that addresses the global health concerns of marginalized populations."

In Honduras, changing rainfall patterns, prolonged droughts, and the increased incidence of natural disasters, combined with poor growing conditions and soil quality, make subsistence agriculture challenging. Despite advances in decreasing macronutrient deficiencies, micronutrient deficiencies, such as iron deficiency anemia, continue to be prevalent throughout Honduras. A nutritional transition is also underway in Honduras, with changing lifestyle and dietary habits leading to an increased prevalence of non-communicable diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Simultaneously, out-migration of primarily young adults from rural Honduras to urban centres or to the United States is fundamentally re-shaping rural communities. 

Anchored by an intersectoral partnership, this project will investigate relationships between out-migration and health within the context of climate change. Specific research objectives are: 1) to identify and compare the health and food security of migrant and non-migrant households over time; and 2) to assess how out-migration and climate change are influencing food and nutritional security. Using household data collected in 2014, follow-up data will be collected with the same households and will be complemented by environmental data and interviews with selected households. Data analysis will explore relationships among demographic, socio-economic, environmental, agri-food, and health variables at the individual, household, and community levels. Additionally, analyses of interviews will focus on responses to the perceived relationships among health, migration, and climate change. Study findings will be shared locally and with regional partners in Guatemala and Nicaragua."

Exploring the associations between Lung Function and Sedentary Time among Middle-Aged and Older Canadian Men and Women,"['Dogra, Shilpa', 'Copeland, Jennifer L']","['Buman, Matthew P', 'Gardiner, Paul', 'Stickland, Michael K']","['Asthma', 'Copd', 'Functional Fitness', 'Physical Activity', 'Pulmonary Function', 'Sedentary Behaviour', 'Spirometry']",70000.0,352420,"Aging is associated with changes to the heart, lungs, brain and muscles. An established way to slow such changes is through an active lifestyle. More recently, reducing the amount of time one spends sitting in a day has been associated with improved health and a lower risk of disability. However, there is little research on the relationship between sitting time and respiratory specific health outcomes. 
Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are respiratory diseases that affect 8% and 12% of adult Canadians, respectively. In fact, COPD is one of the fastest growing chronic diseases in Canada. People with asthma and COPD often feel short of breath and this shortness of breath may make it difficult for them to be active. This inactivity may lead to further declines in functional ability and lung function. One strategy to get adults with lung disease out of this vicious cycle might be to reduce their sitting time, as this may be a more feasible starting point than physical activity. 
The purpose of the proposed research is to determine if sitting time is associated with lung function; to determine the relationships between sitting time with healthcare use and quality of life among people with asthma and COPD; and to determine the impact that reducing sitting time would have on lung function. The Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging has all of the variables necessary to understand these associations. Specifically, it contains information on lung function, healthcare use, quality of life and sitting time, as well as information on functional fitness, physical activity, respiratory disease, and many other factors that may impact these associations.
Reducing sedentary time may be a new way to reduce the age-related decline in lung function in older adults, and it may be particularly beneficial among those who feel short of breath, as physical activity may be too challenging."

Furthermore, it is not known what types and patterns of sitting behaviours are associated with negative health outcomes in older adults,  how the prevalence or consequences of sedentary time differs between men and women, or what dose of sedentary time is associated with increased risk. At this early stage of research on sedentary time in older adults, it is essential that experts come together to create research priorities and agree upon a consistent public health message that is appropriate for both men and women. Thus, an important outcome of this meeting will be the evidence informed consensus statement that will be published in an open access journal. This will ensure that researchers, health professionals and knowledge users who work with older men and women have access to accurate information on sedentary time for older adults. This meeting will also lead to the development of research priorities and research groups that will work on creating new knowledge. An important priority will be the development of Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines for Older Men and Women. Canada has been a leader in the development and dissemination of Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines for children and youth, however, resources for older adults are limited. This planning meeting is a critical first step in bringing together experts to plan these important projects."

Unfortunately, we know very little about the environmental features that influence physical activity levels of older adults living in cities, and we do not know if these factors influence their health. We plan on using a large database that contains physical activity and health information on over 50,000 Canadians as well as information on the air quality, walkability, and health inequalities of the neighbourhoods these older adults are living in. Analysing these data will help us identify factors that influence physical activity and health of older adults living in cities.

Adults over the age of 65 years are spending the most time in such activities, in some cases because they have conditions that make movement painful, uncomfortable, or challenging. Importantly, older adults are also not getting enough daily activity. This increases their chances of developing diseases such as cancer and heart disease. In order to help older adults sit less and move more, we will develop a program that slowly progresses individuals from sedentary lifestyles to more active lifestyles. For this research, we first want to know what older adults, exercise and recreation professionals, and healthcare professionals think of this approach, and what elements they would want in such a program. Once we hear from them, we will create the program, and deliver it in a healthcare or community setting. Health and recreation professionals will tell older adults about the program, and they will be signed up for the program.

Due to low HCP-to-patient ratio, the burden of ongoing assessment and intervention often falls on the mother (e.g., feeding of expressed breast milk via cup, skin-to-skin contact). However, mothers are inadequately trained compared to HCPs, creating a knowledge gap in how to improve their babies' chances of surviving and thriving. The current study will utilize a mixed method approach to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and impact of a complementary HBS module to train mothers in essential newborn care. First, a needs assessment will be conducted using focus groups of mothers and HCPs at an international HBS Center to assist in identifying educational needs and priorities of the module. Once the mothers' module has been created, we will evaluate the acceptability and impact with mothers (n=60) who have recently given birth to a preterm or at-risk newborn in a HBS Centre using a pre-post test design. Mothers and HCPs will provide feedback on the acceptability of the module as well as impact data will be collected on neonatal outcomes (e.g., mortality, temperature, growth) and maternal outcomes (e.g., confidence, knowledge on essential care) before and after receiving the training. It is anticipated that this module will reduce the burden on HCPs and optimize newborn outcomes."

The CHAPP is a community program which will be implemented by trained volunteers. In the program, the volunteers will invite community residents to attend CHAPP sessions where the volunteer will ask the residents questions about their health practices and also check their blood pressure, weight and height. The information of the residents will be entered into a computer and the computer program will show if the residents have a high risk of having diabetes. Those who have high risk of having diabetes will be seen by the public health midwife present during the CHAPP session to check the blood sugar of the resident. Residents who have high blood sugar will be asked to come back to have a repeat blood sugar check after they have fasted for 8-hours. Residents who have a high blood sugar after fasting will be asked to have a check-up with the public health doctor. If the residents consent, all information collected during the CHAPP sessions will be given to the public health office to help those who are at risk of having diabetes. In the first year of this research, the researchers will check how to best make the CHAPP fit in the community setting. In the second year, the CHAPP will be tested in 2 communities to check if there are problems in running the program. In the third and fourth year, the CHAPP will be tested if it decreases the number of people who have high risk of having the diabetes in 20 communities. If the CHAPP is effective, the fifth year will be used to inform government officials and health workers about how CHAPP can be implemented long term and in other communities. The CHAPP researchers will also talk to researchers and health workers from low and middle income countries like the Philippines regarding how CHAPP can be applied in their setting."

Community organizations focused on health and well being need to form strong coalition efforts to generate an strong collaborative effort to address cardiovascular health promotion and prevention.  This project aims to understand how different stages of coalition development  within communities (formative, maintainance, and institutionalization stages) are associated with changes over time in individual health, population health and system-level outcomes within small and medium sized communities in Ontario. A modified time series analysis will be carried out incorporating agency and participants surveys as well as community level administrative data on cardiovascular outcomes will be gathered. The information gleaned will be important for health funders to provide for support for public health engagement into knowledge dissemination and  will provide a template for further community participatory research approaches to chronic disease management and prevention."

Canada is the second-highest PO consuming country in the world and has an estimated 500,000 - 1.25 million people using POs non-medically. PO misuse can result in serious health harms such as addiction, overdose, and death. It can also bring a tremendous burden for health-care system (e.g., emergency department visits, addiction treatments). Studies have found that PO misuse has become increasingly common among people who use illicit drugs, and these people are more likely to experience prescription opioid misuse related harms including elevated risk of HIV or HCV infection, reluctance to engage with addiction treatments, and developing riskier drug use behaviors. Previous qualitative and cross-sectional studies in U.S. have demonstrated the rising prevalence of transition to injection drug use among PO misusers. However, the knowledge of PO misuse among illicit drug users is still fragmented, insufficient, and is not thoroughly studied in a Canadian setting. Therefore, this work aims to characterize the complex risk profiles of PO misusers and explore the unique impact of PO misuse on injection drug use patterns among this at-risk population. Data will be collected from three ongoing CIHR- and U.S. National Institutes of Health-funded prospective cohort studies comprised of over 3200 illicit drug users in the Greater Vancouver area, Canada. The research findings will contribute to the development of more effective harm reduction interventions, health care and disease management strategies."

The opioid epidemic is a complex problem, and one of the major drivers of this epidemic is the untreated opioid use disorder (OUD). There is limited scientific evidence regarding the individual, interpersonal, communal, and societal level factors contributing to the risk of developing OUD. Therefore, this postdoctoral research program aims to: (1) review the scientific literature on predictors of OUD for people who use opioids; and (2) build comprehensive and reliable predictive models for OUD using machine learning methods, which can overcome the critical challenges often faced by traditional statistical models when handling high-dimensional data. This postdoctoral research program will make important contributions to understanding mechanisms underlying development of OUD, informing design of impactful prevention and treatment strategies to curb the opioid overdose crisis, and ultimately improving clinical care and public health policy priority setting."

Moreover, the selection of an appropriate drug therapy is very patient specific and should take into consideration not only the potential benefits and harms, but also patient preferences. There are currently no standardized approaches that take these three factors into consideration to allow for a quick comparison across treatment alternatives. My research will use advanced methods for quantifying the relationship between effectiveness, safety and patient preference. Specifically, I will study the newest medications approved in Canada to treat type 2 diabetes called the sodium-glucose transport protein-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors. The SGLT-2 inhibitors work by blocking the kidney from reabsorbing sugar back into the bloodstream thereby lowering blood glucose levels. These drugs are effective in managing diabetes and have even been shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes in high risk patients. There are however several safety concerns including higher rates of infections, kidney disease and bone fractures. The manner in which patients make trade-offs between these benefits and harms are not understood. My doctoral dissertation will consist of four studies: the first will summarize the clinical evidence and rank the safety and effectiveness of the SGLT-2 inhibitors compared to other common diabetes medications; the second will evaluate the reasons why patients prefer certain diabetes medications over others; the third and fourth studies will use findings from the first two studies to calculate a summary measure regarding the overall trade-offs of the potential benefits and harms for the SGLT-2 inhibitors using two different approaches. My research aims to improve patient safety and lead to better health outcomes and lower healthcare costs."

The lay counsellors have found that the services for depression during pregnancy and after birth are not culturally safe. We will work with lay counsellors and women in the villages of rural Rajasthan to understand the ways that culture impacts how they seek and receive services for depression during pregnancy. The women and lay counsellors will be our research partners. We will work with an expert to ensure that the women and lay counsellors remain safe during the research. We will ask women to take photos to help explain the impact of culture on depression. We will ask lay counsellors to take notes to help explain what pieces of culture are not being understood. We will interview both women and lay counsellors to help explain their pictures and notes. We will have group discussions to ensure that we understand the experiences of the women and lay counsellors correctly. We will work with women and lay counsellors and a creative expert to develop including a documentary film, a photobook, a children's book. This information can help community members better understand depression in pregnancy and how they can help. We will include branding to make sure that the voices of the women and lay counsellors are heard. We will then change our screening tools and talk therapy programs in response to our learning. Through this work, we hope to identify factors that lead to depression so we can find ways to reduce the rate of depression in pregnant women. We can then use this learning to help pregnant women who are depressed in other countries."

Social loneliness and racism are risk factors for mental wellness while cultural ways, community infrastructure are protective factors for mental wellness.  Poverty, colonization, residential schools are risk factors for mental wellness while language, culture and heritage, and self-determination are protective for mental wellness. We will collect information on these risk and protective factors. Mental health outcomes include stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, substance abuse and suicidal ideation. The project will be based on the values embodied in Tipi Teachings. Tipi Teachings correspond to current concepts of determinants of positive mental health in Indigenous peoples. This is a chance for the communities to evaluate and promote fundamental issues around housing, the house as a home, the effect of these on mental wellness, and the way mental wellness affects the house and home.

The sexual health of young rural Canadians: Examining positive outcomes and the gendered dynamics of power,"['Doull, Marion J']",['N/A'],"['Adolescents', 'Gender', 'Interviews', 'Positive Sexual Health', 'Power', 'Qualitative', 'Quantitative', 'Rural', 'Survey']",135000.0,180859,"Research has shown that gendered power dynamics within heterosexual relationships influence sexual health outcomes in both positive and negative ways. Gendered power dynamics are generally characterized by inequity. This inequity or imbalance in power often means that women have less power within relationships as compared to males. This imbalance in power often stems from gender - the social expectations of what it means to be a man or a woman.  

This project proposes to investigate the positive aspects of sexual health and the gendered dynamics of power among young heterosexual Canadians living in rural and Northern settings in British Columbia. Adolescents living in rural and Northern communities face unique challenges as compared to their urban counterparts which may impede their ability to achieve positive sexual health. First, this project will use interviews to talk to young people about how they experience and use power within their sexual relationships. The results of these interviews will be used to develop a survey to explore the links between the gendered dynamics of power, social determinants of health (e.g. income, ethnicity), and positive (e.g. communication, pleasure) and negative (e.g. sexually transmitted infections) sexual health outcomes. 

This research will improve our understanding of the sexual health of young rural and Northern Canadians, a unique and often overlooked population. The addition of a positive perspective will provide a more complete picture of young people's sexual health, which extends beyond risk and negative outcomes. Moreover, this project will help us understand how the gendered power dynamics influence both positive and negative outcomes and provide insight into issues of gender equity. This enhanced perspective will allow for the creation of programs and interventions that reach young people more effectively to improve their sexual health."

Food system incentives are currently aligned to promote cheap calories and expensive nutrients, which compromises the health of populations and leads to the double burden of diet-related disease. Leveraging agriculture to improve the availability and affordability of nutrient-dense foods (high in vitamins and minerals) will reorient the food system towards a healthier and more sustainable food supply. There is an urgent need to identify feasible cost-effective agricultural interventions that improve access to nutrient-dense foods to reduce the double burden. This study has three aims. First, using value chain analysis, it will identify innovative agricultural interventions that improve access to nutrient-dense foods. An analysis of fruit and vegetable value chains in Kenya, India and Myanmar will be conducted. Second, the study will evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of agricultural interventions using a microsimulation model populated from existing data sources. Third, the study will prioritise a package of agricultural interventions to inform policy development and implementation to address the double-burden of diet-related disease. Qualitative interviews with key value chain stakeholders will be conducted in each country and a health impact assessment-based prioritisation tool will be used to assess the feasibility of policy options, forming the basis of a framework for leveraging agriculture. This project offers a major contribution by developing evidence-based guidance on a package of agricultural interventions that represent best-buys and a scaling-up framework for leveraging agriculture to address diet-related disease. The findings of the study have global relevance for all countries that are striving to increase access to nutrient-dense foods to improve population health."

It is important to use this window of opportunity to examine how effectively federal, provincial and regional pandemic plans have been implemented.  From discussions with our Decision-Maker Advisory Team we know that many communications plans were prepared in advance of any outbreak. However, all of these different jurisdictional public health offices have had to modify their respective communications messaging to manage the H1N1 outbreak that, so far, has been much less severe than had been originally anticipated in the pandemic preparedness plans. One of the biggest challenges they have faced is trying to ensure that their messaging is hitting the right tone in balancing public attention to prevention activities while minimizing public fear/concern. In this project, we are interested in studying: 1) how well different communications plans related to H1N1 were implemented and modified as knowledge evolved during the outbreak; 2) how different public health agencies, front-line health care workers, and the public perceived the effectiveness of the communications messaging during the H1N1 outbreak; and 3) to look at some of the issues that arose when agencies needed to communicate relevant information related to the availability of an H1N1 vaccine in the fall and winter of 2009-2010 and any future waves of the outbreak. We expect that this project will be able to deliver some concrete recommendations of how to improve risk communication planning for future outbreaks to better meet the information needs of front-line health care workers and the Canadian public."

While this is similar messaging to what is heard in cold/flu season, what separates these events apart is the inherent uncertainty involved during the emergence of a novel virus. 

However, when public health best practice (e.g. quarantining returning nationals from Wuhan) is attacked as putting people in ""medical jails"", or when the WHO implores governments for emergency resources to manage the outbreak by declaring the novel virus as ""public enemy number one"" akin to a ""global threat potentially worse than terrorism"", it creates a paradox around the concept of precaution. There is an urgent need to examine the cultural, social and political responses to the management of the current outbreak in real time.

The objectives of this research are: 1) to evaluate how cautionary public health messages for the outbreak are presented by the news media; 2) to evaluate whether public health agencies are using social media and how well these tools, if used, increase public understanding of these outbreaks; 3) to assess how members of the general public, including special targeted groups, understand the outbreak, both the risks of disease and the risks of contraction; 4) to evaluate how effectively members of the public feel they can protect themselves given public health outbreak communication, and how they make sense of this relative to seasonal influenza risk messaging; and 5) to assess public response to a novel vaccine if one becomes available.

We will meet these objectives through a content analysis of news media stories / social media, and interviews with public health communication leads (objs 1&2) and focus groups/surveys with members of the general public and targeted communities (e.g. Indigenous peoples, Asians) in select Canadian cities (objs 3-5)."

Systematically marginalized populations, such as First Nations/Métis/Inuit (FN/M/I), have been greatly affected by COVID-19 in Canada. This is why people identifying as FN/M/I were prioritized for COVID-19 vaccines. This policy was adopted Canada-wide, except in Manitoba. In Manitoba, only First Nations Peoples were prioritized for COVID-19 vaccines. Inuit and Métis Citizens were to access COVID-19 vaccines following age-eligibility criteria like all other Manitobans. This policy changed in May 2021 in acknowledgement of the ""impacts of colonization on all Indigenous people in Canada"". Vaccines were handled differently during H1N1, where only Manitoba prioritized people of Indigenous Ancestry (FN/I/M) for H1N1 vaccine in Canada. Manitoba's COVID-19 vaccine policy has had a negative impact on vaccine uptake by the Red River Métis. 

In this project we aim to study:
1.Ongoing COVID-19 vaccine decision-making processes among Métis Citizens;

2.Harms (e.g. COVID-19 infection rates, health service use for COVID-19, lower vaccine uptake) created by a racist policy that disadvantaged Métis relative to all other Manitobans;

3.The impact on possible COVID-19 cases if Red River Métis had been prioritized for vaccination earlier in the pandemic; and

4.Long-term consequences and possible loss of trust among Métis in provincial health systems.

Methods: 
We will carry out focus group discussions with Red River Métis (obj 1, 2, 4) to examine Métis experiences given the provincial public health COVID response, and use whole-population administrative health and COVID vaccination data, updated monthly, to compare Métis experiences to all other Manitobans (obj 2, 3). 

Impact:
As we enter the fourth wave, we need to document the experiences of Red River Métis relative to all other Manitobans. Only then might we be able to better understand how we can close the gap in Métis vaccine uptake."

One group of ECEs (control group) from 11 childcare centres did not receive training, while a second group of ECEs (experimental group) from 11 different childcare centres, participated in a single 4-hour workshop that included a review of the Canadian physical activity recommendations, and strategies to support children's physical activity during childcare. The workshop was part of an 8-week multi-component physical activity intervention known as the Supporting Physical Activity in the Childcare Environment (SPACE) study. ECEs completed paper surveys to assess their knowledge and confidence before the intervention, and again at 8 weeks. After the intervention, ECEs who participated in the experimental group reported greater knowledge and higher confidence compared to ECEs in the control group. Therefore, the results suggest that participation in the SPACE study, including training, improved ECEs' knowledge of physical activity guidelines and supported their confidence to engage preschoolers in physical activity while attending childcare. Efforts that focus on educating ECEs on physical activity-related practices during childcare could help to improve the health of young children in care."

While this period of development is marked by increased personal autonomy, it is also a time of difficult personal, emotional, vocational, and social adjustments. As such, any transition, and especially the school-to-work transition, can contribute to alterations in the course of mental health and overall wellbeing. In fact, the World Health Organization reports that emerging adults are particularly at risk for serious mental health issues when they are transitioning and adjusting to full-time work after graduation. Mental health related problems have become one of the leading causes for absenteeism from work and exclusion from the labour force due to work-related stress.
Current trends in research are showing that social support, peer support, and a strong sense of belonging during late adolescence and emerging adulthood can improve overall health outcomes and help emerging adults adjust successfully to their first full-time job. Easing the transition results in reduced work-related stress and a reduction in the use of formal mental health, medical, and social services.
Therefore, the creation of an effective e-mental health solution that can specifically address the support and belonging needs of emerging adults who are transitioning into a competitive labour market and adapting to their new workplace can make a significant contribution in reducing the incidence of work related stress and mental illness throughout the life course, in addition to having national economic implications."

It is a leading cause of hospitalizations and costs the Canadian healthcare system over $2 billion per year. Asthma is difficult to diagnose in young children due to variable and fluctuating symptoms, and the lack of standardized tests. These challenges result in delayed diagnosis, which hinders the study of risk factors for early-onset lung disease. We address this by including quantitative assessments of lung health such as repeated measures of lung function from infancy throughout early childhood from the Canadian CHILD Cohort Study. Longitudinal studies have reported that children who are diagnosed with asthma later in life show impaired lung function during infancy. This suggests that the perinatal and preschool years are important for lung development and asthma risk. Our study aims to identify novel risk factors of asthma and low lung during this critical window of early childhood. Specifically, we will identify genetic factors inherited from parents to children that are associated with lung health and asthma risk. In addition, we will determine if certain environmental exposures during pregnancy and throughout early childhood affect genetic predisposition to asthma or lung function. Our innovative study leverages existing data and resources from the largest population-based birth cohort in Canada that recruited over 3000 families to study early-life determinants of chronic diseases such as asthma. In addition, we have established collaborations with international childhood cohorts to replicate identified risk factors. The knowledge gained from this proposed study will inform on mitigation strategies to reduce the burden of asthma and other chronic respiratory diseases through public policy and educating the public as well as health care providers."

The purpose of this study is to assess the factors influencing the willingness and ability of older adults living at home in Brazil to perform a simple activity designed to maintain mobility. This simple activity is the act of repeatedly standing up from a chair and sitting down and can be completed in the context of daily life.  My proposed study builds on research completed with older adults living in Canadian long-term care facilities.  Residents with dementia who practiced standing up and sitting down two to four times a day had better mobility and ability to complete daily activities compared with a similar group who did not do the sit-to-stand activity. The elegant simplicity of the intervention, which does not require specialized training or equipment, has the potential to be spread to other cultural and geographic contexts. This research is significant because of an aging international population that could benefit from a low-cost mobility-enhancing  activity that does not require specialized equipment or training."

This study proposes to identify the key barriers that remain once a new diagnostic has been developed, looking at recent technological advances that ultimately failed to be authorized, adopted, or able to change prescribing. It will also look at technologies that have helped in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. Are there any features or particularities that seem to have improved their chance of success? Lessons from the failures and few successes will be used to assess chances for products in the pipeline, examining how regulation, reimbursement, technology transfer, and organizational characteristics might be improved to make them succeed within the clinical setting.

Traditionally, population-wide data collection efforts are very difficult to execute due to the level of recruiting, cost, and methodological reliability. As a result, cohort studies are used to collect detailed data. Additionally, they may lack any representation of real-world environments such as households, schools, transit, workplaces, health facilities, and food environment. Here, we propose developing the SynthEco platform to operationalize government, private and academic research for population level urban and intervention planning by combining various disparate data collection efforts into a population-level, geographically explicit representation. It will be built upon the concept of a Synthetic Ecosystem (SE), a statistically representative virtual population embedded within a real-world environment. SEs serve as a key information technology for combining disparate data sources into a realistic, coherent whole, free of privacy concerns. They can be pivotal in planning population level health interventions in three ways: 1) by filling knowledge gaps that plague the use of cohort studies in population-level intervention and urban planning, 2) elucidating inequities in services throughout a population, and 3) aiding in developing and validating new measures of population health. SynthEco will allow planners and researchers to create, visualize and download Synthetic Ecosystems and will provide a general capability to operationalize cohort studies at the full population level by placing persons in a grounded real-world environment support decision making in urban and health interventions planning."

Understanding how these factors interact with our genes to promote better or worse life during aging can help us to create more efficient preventive actions during life course to not only extend life expectancy but also promoting better quality of life. In the present study, we propose to examine how those psychosocial factors contribute to some of the main chronic diseases that compromise the quality of life for aging population, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and depression. These diseases have many similar symptoms and complications and also share many psychosocial and behavioral risk factors.

Because they are also at greater risk of complications from COVID-19 infections, seniors have been especially targeted by social and physical distancing measures, further limiting their social interactions. In a post-lockdown world where social restrictions are likely to last for vulnerable aging populations, it is important to find the appropriate balance between physical distancing and social connection (be it in-person, digital, or a combination of both) to promote older adults' long term well-being and resilience. 
This project aims to answer the following questions: Among older adults, who are the most vulnerable to the mental health effects of social isolation? What strategies are the most likely to succeed in preventing or mitigating the effects of social isolation? 
To this end, we will review the most recent scientific evidence and share our findings with 'knowledge users' such as healthcare professionals, policymakers, and patient groups. Building upon these findings, we will be able to simulate different interventions using a digital platform known as SynthEco.

The general objective is to use a twin-study design to investigate the quantitative genetic, shared, and unique environmental influences on dietary intake, and to estimate its contribution to the development of obesity. Data collected from a birth cohort of 675 twin pairs born between 1996-1998 will allow us to assess the extent to which different food intake and eating behaviours, measured from birth to 9 years of age, and usual dietary intake, measured at 9 years of age, account for the genetic and environmental (shared and unshared) influences on body weight trajectories and the development of obesity to the age of 15 years. This includes an investigation of common, correlated, and interacting genetic and environmental effects on dietary habits and on the development of obesity. This research is important because, in most cases, obesity does not come about as a result of markedly defective biology, but rather by maladaptive behaviours nurtured by an obesogenic environment. A susceptibility to obesity is partly determined by genetic factors, but an ""obesity-promoting environment"" is typically necessary for its phenotypic expression. Such a genetically mediated susceptibility to environmental exposure may result from gene-environment interactions, mediation, and/or confounders. There is a paucity of literature on gene-diet interactions in childhood obesity, and large twin-birth cohorts are essential for the development of such knowledge."

Understanding early-life determinants of obesity is thus central to designing public health interventions that increase the proportion of children entering adulthood with healthy weights. Although nutrition is recognized as one of the key modifiable factors for obesity prevention, studies on the long-term relationships between early-life diet and later-life excess weight or later-life dietary habits are lacking. To bridge this gap, our research aims to identify early-life dietary factors that are associated with healthy and unhealthy dietary habits in young adults relative to their weight status. Study participants are young adults taking part in the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development (QLSCD), under the direction of the Institut de la Statistique du Québec (ISQ). This birth cohort comprises a representative sample of children born in Quebec 20 years ago; 1,750 young adults still actively participate in the study. Over the years, ISQ staff have met with these children and their families to collect data on multiple aspects of child development since birth. We also conducted an extensive nutrition study when the children were aged 4.5 years. We propose this project to assess dietary habits and weight status at age 22. The data collected from birth to early adulthood will enable us to analyze how dietary factors and other determinants active in early childhood are associated with the dietary habits of young adults according to weight status. Findings of this research will reinforce and add to current knowledge about early-life influences on later-life diet and excess weight; allow identifying the ages at which influences are first detectable; identify protective factors that could reduce risks over time; and assess the cumulative effects of a variety of influences prevalent from birth to early adulthood."

This involves investigating what triggers it, in terms of strategies that foster its development, and what results from it, in terms of their impact on healthy public policy program development, within a regional context. 

We identified four initiatives that took place between 1997 and 2012 within a Quebec region (Chaudière-Appalaches):

• Case 1: Program for the prevention of psychological distress among farmers
• Case 2: Construction of a play park for children aged 0 to 5 years
• Case 3: Program of collective kitchens in Beauce-Sartigan
• Case 4: Program for the prevention of alcohol-impaired driving

Our analysis of these four different intersectoral initiatives was developed around the following seven dimensions: the problem, the population health objectives, other objectives, the outcomes, the actors, the processes and the context. The analysis focused on the benefits, facilitating conditions and challenges of intersectoral action in health, including a discussion of the role and legitimacy of the health sector as an instigator of intersectoral partnerships."

Pelvic floor surgery includes procedures to treat conditions such as incontinence and prolapse of the pelvic organs. There has been a good deal of innovation in pelvic floor surgery in recent decades, but also the use of some devices and procedures that caused harm and are the subject of lawsuits, particularly procedures that used permanent synthetic mesh. We will examine why this happened in pelvic floor surgery and ask whether certain types of values and ways of thinking in surgery are associated with problems, and how medical decisions and values are impacted by the specific contexts in which treatment decisions are made. In addition, we seek to develop research methods and tools that will help clinicians make the best possible decisions given the situations in which they work. We seek to understand developments in pelvic floor surgery in order to promote ethical, appropriate medical practices in the future."

Avec le vieillissement de la population, ces troubles cognitifs auront de sérieuses répercussions pour les personnes atteintes, les familles qui s'en occupent et le système des soins de santé. L'inflammation et l'oxydation sont des réactions dans l'organisme associées au vieillissement et au développement de la démence. Ainsi, des concentrations sanguines élevées de facteurs d'inflammation comme la protéine C-réactive (CRP) et l'interleukine-6 (IL-6) de même que le raccourcissement des télomères, des structures qui protègent nos cellules de l'oxydation et de l'inflammation, pourraient être reliés à un risque plus élevé de démence. Par ailleurs, certains stresseurs au travail ont été associés à des concentrations élevées de CRP et d'IL-6 et à un raccourcissement des télomères. Il serait alors possible que ces stresseurs au travail jouent un rôle dans le développement de la démence via l'effet intermédiaire des facteurs d'inflammation et d'oxydation. Le présent projet de recherche vise à évaluer : 1) l'association entre trois facteurs d'inflammation et d'oxydation (CRP, IL-6 et télomères) et la dysfonction cognitive; et 2) le rôle intermédiaire de ces facteurs sanguins dans la relation entre les stresseurs au travail et la dysfonction cognitive. Ces objectifs seront réalisés à partir d'une étude importante constituée de plus de 9 000 Canadiens suivis depuis 22 ans. Les résultats de ce projet de recherche contribueront à identifier des facteurs qui précèdent le diagnostic de troubles cognitifs comme la dysfonction cognitive. Les stresseurs au travail étant fréquents, il serait possible d'intervenir éventuellement dans les milieux de travail pour ralentir le développement de troubles cognitifs plus sévères comme la démence. Cette étude permettra d'obtenir des informations qui serviront aux connaissances pour un vieillissement actif et satisfaisant."

Even with these challenges, many community-based harm reduction providers have found ways to make services work better within their community. These providers are important leaders, becoming harm reduction information and expertise hubs. There is benefit in linking these hubs together to share what they have learned about what works when providing harm reduction services, to identify gaps in knowledge and information relating to their work and to discuss potential research questions that could support harm reduction in rural communities moving forward. We propose a series of monthly, virtual meetings bringing together experts on harm reduction in small urban, rural and remote places across BC. Allowing people to come together to network, build relationships, and set priorities for research moving forward, with a goal of answering the following research questions: ""What harm reduction practices and approaches best support people living in small urban, rural and remote communities? What unique and innovative programs/services have community-based organizations developed to support their service users and why are they successful? Where are there gaps in knowledge that if filled, would allow rural CBOs to improve outcomes?"" This series of meetings will allow for the discussion and sharing of successful practices and approaches and laying the groundwork for future research priorities including a clear work plan to further refine future research priorities and a strategic plan for seeking out funding to support this work."

The increasing need for mental health services in the wake of recent student suicides has overwhelmed resources and has been described as a mental health crisis on campuses. Yet, there is little evidence to inform universities as to specifically what mental health support services are needed and for whom and how best to deliver these services.  An important next step towards answering these questions is to understand the pathways leading from risk and protective factors to different mental health and academic outcomes.  To address this question, we leverage an existing collaboration and past experience in student survey studies, and propose a longitudinal study of students over the critical first year of study at either Queen's or Oxford universities.  Through an electronic survey sent via university email to each first year student in the first semester, we will evaluate important risk and protective factors across family, person and environment domains.  We will also assess important influential variables such as lifestyle and attitudes.  At the end of term, students will complete a follow-up survey asking about academic outcomes, mental health and the use and effectiveness of mental health support services.  Findings will  inform the development of resiliency building and mental illness prevention initiatives for the undergraduate student population, and the development of early intervention mental health services for targeted high-risk or help-seeking subgroups. Broader implications of this work include understanding mechanisms of resilience, mitigating morbidity and mortality related to emergent mental illness, and determining multi-level contributors to academic success. This research project will form a platform for the development of a national student mental health research program with international links."

Authoritative reports have highlighted the need for research to reliably estimate student mental health needs, identify risk factors and develop student tailored mental health supports with facilitated transitions to higher intensity services.  This proposal uses digital technology and the best available evidence in partnership with students and stakeholders across campus and in the community to adapt, implement and evaluate integrated initiatives organized in a stepped care model with facilitated transitions to different levels of support. The initiatives were co-developed with students at Queen's with prior funding and include: (i) an electronic longitudinal survey to follow students through undergraduate studies assessing well-being, mental health, access to care and the student experience, (ii) an online credit-bearing mental health literacy course, (iii) a digital student well-being platform that supports self-monitoring and access to digital wellness resources, and (iv) a student-facing electronic health passport to engage students and providers on campus and in the community in monitoring and adjusting the nature and intensity of care.  This work will improve well-being and mental health across the diverse student population and clarify care pathways. In addition, in partnership with students we will develop a novel digital student mental health calculator which will help connect students to the appropriate level of support on a more timely basis."

Arsenic is a material that occurs naturally in some rocks. Arsenic present in rocks can enter well water, which is used for drinking water in many parts of Canada. Many Canadians who obtain drinking water from a private well do not follow guidelines about well water testing and treatment. Our current study, funded by the Canadian Cancer Society, is studying the risk of cancer related to arsenic in drinking water in Nova Scotia. We will use this information to devise interventions, community engagement and knowledge transfer activities to improve public take-up of well water testing guidelines and therefore reduce the impact of arsenic in well water on health. We will undertake surveys, interviews and focus groups to identify why people do or do not routinely test and treat their water. We will test an intervention to increase well water testing and treatment in areas where arsenic is present in drinking water wells. This will reduce the amount of cancers that may be caused by arsenic and other heavy metals.

This study will identify reasons why many people do not follow government advice regarding testing their well water supply for arsenic and other heavy metals that may cause cancer. We will talk to residents who get their drinking water from a private well. We will also talk to government officials to try to understand in more detail why people do not have their well water tested or treat unsafe water. This information will help us devise interventions that encourage people to follow guidelines regarding well water testing and use. We will support advocacy by utilising the extensive resources of the Canadian Cancer Society Nova Scotia Division, who are knowledge translation partners in this proposal.

Interestingly, the socio-environmental contexts in which people are born, grow up and live (e.g., exposure to pollutants, familial context, social adversity) may affect the ""epigenetic programming"" of some genes in the long term and sometimes for future generations. 
Epigenetic research is ethically sensitive because it points to some stakeholders, for instance, polluting industries and misbehaving parents, who may be found morally responsible for wrongful epigenetic programming. Concerns over the possibility that misuses of epigenetic information may lead to stigmatization or unjust discrimination have also emerged in recent years. Two hypotheses of my research project are listed as belows: 1) Currently, epigenetic research, findings, and information are not sufficiently taken into account in existing laws, policies and guidelines, including those developed in the context of genetics research; and 2) Early engagement of scientific experts and bioethics scholars in discussions about the implications of epigenetics for policy making purposes could provide credible foresight for responsible governance. 
The objective of this research project is to better understand how epigenetics findings should be integrated into laws, policies and guidelines from experts' perspective. Using a 3-round survey, I will collect and analyze qualitative and quantitative data, build a consensus about most imperative issues and provide solutions. Further analysis of the current Canadian regulatory environment will be performed to identify gaps and flaws. The results will provide timely guidance for policy-makers to integrate epigenetics into sustainable health care and public policies."
Connecting Across Generations: Tackling agism through intergenerational programming,"['Dupuis, Constance']",['N/A'],"['Agism', 'Intergenerational Connection']",549.0,497928,"My postdoctoral research aims to deepen our understanding of overcoming the negative effects of age-segregated societies by investigating the benefits and challenges of an Intergenerational Club. The club brings together McMaster students and older adults from the Hamilton area in monthly 2-hour sessions from September 2023 to April 2024. Our primary focus is to explore the perspectives of both older adults and students, evaluating the potential impact of the project on their social health and well-being.
Our overarching goal is to investigate the impact of intergenerational programming on both older adults and university-level students, with a focus on promoting social health and well-being. Recognizing the scarcity of opportunities for such exchanges, we aim to contribute to reducing agism and enhancing relations between different generations.
Building on the feedback from our pilot study, the project has been refined to address challenges such as an uneven ratio of older adults to students and a desire for more semi-structured or unstructured time. We have renamed the program to Intergenerational Club based on participant feedback. We also aim to expand on successful elements, including the content of sessions, particularly the art-making sessions, to create an environment that fosters meaningful connections across generations."
Café Scientifique: Let's talk about muscle and bone health,"['Duque, Gustavo']",['N/A'],"['Education', 'Musculoskeletal Disease', 'Older Persons', 'Osteoporosis', 'Sarcopenia']",6000.0,485619,"Osteoporosis (bone loss that predisposes to fractures) and sarcopenia (loss of muscle mass and strength that predisposes to falls, poor balance, and weakness) are diseases that frequently happen together in older persons. Only 20% of older Canadians with osteoporosis and <5% of older persons with sarcopenia are diagnosed or treated in the community. This is partially explained by limited awareness about these conditions amongst our older population and their caregivers, their concerns about side effects associated with osteoporosis drugs, and their lack of adherence to interventions such as nutrition and exercise. However, the catastrophic consequences of these conditions could be avoided if prompt prevention, identification, and treatment strategies were implemented. 
Using a very interactive format, our ""Café Scientifique: Let's talk about muscle and bone health,"" coordinated by the RUISSS McGill Centre of Excellence for Sustainable Health of Seniors, will bring together internationally recognized experts from several disciplines (i.e., physicians, nurses, allied health professionals, researchers) with older persons and their caregivers to informally discuss their muscle and bone health, including how to identify osteoporosis and sarcopenia, prevent their complications, and understand how current treatments work. As an additional benefit of this program, we will also target the Latino community, one of the largest minorities in Quebec. Profiting that several members of our team are Spanish speakers, we will organize the ""Un Cafecito"" sessions at churches and community centers. The conversations will focus on sharing the high-quality evidence available on these diseases while identifying the participants' concerns regarding drugs, the use of new technologies, and interventions (i.e., nutrition and exercise). We also expect to motivate them to participate in clinical trials in the field and encourage them to contribute their views on future research directions."

Cependant, ces pratiques ne sont pas encore appliquées dans de nombreux milieux de travail. Ce projet visera donc à combler cet écart en implantant les meilleures pratiques sur la gestion des absences en fonction du contexte d'une usine aux prises avec des problèmes d'absence en raison de problèmes de santé. Il utilisera une approche participative, c'est-à-dire qu'elle sera menée avec l'étroite collaboration des personnes directement concernées dans la gestion des absences dans l'usine. Cette étude permettra d'implanter, avec la collaboration des partenaires, des activités de gestion des absences intégrant les meilleures pratiques issues de la littérature scientifique et de l'adapter à la culture organisationnelle d'une usine. L'utilisation des meilleurs principes permettra de réduire le fardeau de l'incapacité au travail pour les travailleurs et pour l'entreprise en assurant une meilleure coordination de retour au travail, en réduisant la durée des absences du travail et en améliorant la santé des travailleurs absents. L'usine sera donc mieux outillée pour intervenir auprès des travailleurs absents. À long terme, une transposition de l'approche participative pour implanter des activités de gestion des absences à d'autres secteurs, notamment dans les secteurs industriels ou de services, et dans d'autres provinces ou pays pourra être réalisée."
Minority Stress and HIV Risk Behaviour in South Asian-Canadian men who have sex with men,"['Durrani, Samir']",['N/A'],"['Heterosexism', 'Hiv Prevention', 'Hiv Risk Factors', 'Men Who Have Sex With Men', 'Minority Stress', 'Protective Factors', 'Race/Ethnicity', 'Racism', 'Sexual Health Promotion', 'South Asian']",8750.0,284430,"Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) are at an increased risk for HIV infection. Research suggests that the stress associated with being a stigmatized sexual minority (minority stress) is related to HIV risk behaviours (e.g., unprotected anal intercourse). However, these studies have predominantly focused on White populations while largely ignoring the impact of minority stress on HIV risk behaviours in racial/ethnic communities. The present study will address this gap in the literature by investigating the impact of three minority stressors (racism, internalized homophobia, and experiences of heterosexism) on HIV risk behaviours (unprotected anal intercourse and substance use) among South Asian-Canadian MSM. This study is significant because it will be first in its kind to provide data on HIV risk behaviour in a major Canadian ethnic minority group that has been previously neglected in HIV prevention research . Thus, this study will inform future Canadian HIV prevention research and sexual health promotion programs among South-Asian Canadian MSM, which can be expanded to target other MSM of colour. Consequently, this research will contribute to the overall health and well-being of populations at risk for HIV."

The proposed research aims to bring an explicit gendered perspective lacking from much existing research in this topic.  Another disease of interest is canine rabies, an underappreciated and significant killer of people in the less-developed world.

Despite successes in higher-income countries and the Americas, rabies control has proved difficult in many endemic regions of Africa and Asia. Our work, and the work of others, have made it clear that many other forms of heterogeneity (in dog populations, in the physical landscape, and in control efforts) complicate rabies control.

We have access to rabies data from many endemic areas, including very high-quality data from our ongoing contact-tracing in Tanzania, a broad range of research and surveillance data from Kenya, Bhutan and Peru, and surveillance data from other endemic areas.  Although much has been done to analyse these data streams, we believe that more can be learned.

The proposed research will use modern statistical methods to bridge between dynamical models and diverse data streams to inform rabies control.

• Curate and link rabies data streams and improve quality control and follow-up
• Increase understanding of the mechanisms of rabies transmission and what factors underlie successful and unsuccessful control
• Analyse current surveillance and control measures, evaluate alternatives, and quantify the value of different information sources
• Provide tools for knowledge users to visualize rabies information and plan surveillance and control campaigns

Our research team has considerable expertise and our research has generated fundamental and applied insights into rabies dynamics, whilst developing a science platform for effective disease control. We propose to take an collective approach to work in parallel with ongoing work and connect different fronts to bridge and translate critical knowledge gaps. We believe the proposed research holds great promise to provide practical tools to aid public health decision-making to support rabies elimination."
Paid Sick Days as Public Health Policy: Understanding the perspectives of Precarious Workers and Public Health Physicians to strengthen partnerships and influence population health,"['Dutt, Monika']",['N/A'],"['Health Equity', 'Health Promotion And Disease Prevention', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Population Health Intervention Research', 'Psychosocial, Sociocultural And Behavioral Determinants Of H']",105000.0,496434,"The importance of a strong public health sector has been made clear throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Public health is a field that aims to improve the health of populations in many ways. In addition to managing outbreaks, public health is increasingly focused on determinants of health, such as work conditions, income, and immigration status, as well as structural factors such as racism and colonialism. However, during the pandemic, many public health measures required/recommended individual actions without the system level changes needed to support those actions. For example, requiring isolation when many people were unable to do so without housing supports.

As the pandemic progressed, it became clear that some public health measures were not as effective as they could have been because of long-standing social and economic inequities. Many people were unable to follow measures that put the burden of responsibility on the individual. For example, workers who were income-deprived, racialized, and/or lacked immigration status were at far higher risk of acquiring COVID-19 infection and often lacked key labour protections, such as paid sick days. 

To overcome this disconnect between public health measures and the realities of many peoples' lives, new approaches that establish stronger connections between public health and precarious workers are needed. This is key to achieving more effective and equitable public health measures. 

The objective of this research is to examine perspectives of precarious workers and Public Health physicians related to the necessity and feasibility of paid sick days as a public health measure during the COVID-19 pandemic. By understanding how public health can more effectively influence policies through working in solidarity with community labour justice organizers, there will be an anticipated impact of stronger cross-sectoral relationships, improved public health policies, and ultimately, better population health."

We know that health and income are related, with the lowest income individuals experiencing the worst average level of health. However, there is little evidence in Canada that giving people money on a large scale improves their health. One underexplored source of evidence for this relationship is Canadian public pensions. These pensions give a guaranteed annual income of about $18,000 to individuals who satisfy eligibility criteria upon reaching age 65. Using the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging baseline and follow-up data, we will follow individuals over time as they transition onto public pensions. We will apply statistical models to this data to describe how guaranteed income influences physical and mental health outcomes across the income spectrum. We will have a special focus on individuals who can experience a real benefit from a guaranteed annual income, like people who are on social assistance or otherwise at risk of low income prior to age 65. These estimates will be broken out for different identifiable groups and, when appropriate, we will model the change in the distribution of variables rather than changes in the average. This work will provide information to policymakers on the expected benefit of changing the age of eligibility for public pensions, or more broadly, the health impact on different groups in Canada of providing a guaranteed minimum income."

Although research is increasingly demonstrating the benefits of psychedelic-assisted therapy, equity related issues in a number of areas remain to be addressed, such as access to treatment, safety and regulation, representation and diversity, and stigma, discrimination, cultural safety and systemic racism. Emerging research is drawing attention to inequities in psychedelics for particular groups of people including Indigenous Peoples, Communities of Colour, women and gender diverse individuals. Equity oriented health care interventions and strategies for addressing systemic racism and discrimination can serve to address such inequities and promote a psychedelic sector that is more equitable, accessible, and safer. This Cafe Scientifique aims to bring together researchers, health organizations, Indigenous peoples, and people with lived experience to share research findings and/or experiences related to psychedelics and equity, including topics such as decolonizing psychedelics, addressing Whiteness and anti-racism in the psychedelic sector, and making psychedelic-assisted therapy more accessible and equitable for people facing multiple systemic barriers. The Cafe has two components: 1) an in-person event in Vancouver involving a panel of experts speaking about their findings and experiences followed by a moderated public dialogue and recording of ideas and themes discussed; and 2) a follow up virtual session to identify potential priorities, actions, collaborations and opportunities for making psychedelics more equitable in Canada.

To prepare social workers to help people cope with HAND, a study was conducted to understand: a) self-identified concerns of older adults affected by HAND in Ontario; b) how these concerns were currently being addressed; and c) how participants defined the role of social workers. Methods: Four peer researchers (i.e., people aging with HIV who have cognitive challenges) and three social workers recruited people living with HIV over age 50 who expressed HAND concerns. Participants (n=108) completed a survey, and a subset (n=20) were then interviewed. Questions focused on the social determinants of health, HAND testing, cognitive and mental health concerns, existing supports, and the role of social work. After four two-hour analysis meetings, overall findings were determined. Results: 90% of participants were seeing their doctor and taking HIV medications regularly. Despite this, all participants self-reported HAND symptoms with 58% not talking about these concerns with anyone. From the interviews, two major themes emerged: a) fear, shame, and uncertainty concerning HIV and aging; and b) a sense that ""social workers are the meat and potatoes"", which included sub-themes concerning the need for social work HAND support, the positive impact that social workers have had on participants, and the importance of client-focused social work. Conclusions: Participants hesitated to discuss cognitive concerns out of a fear of being labelled as ""less of a person"". Yet, they said that social workers could help ease HAND's challenges by: a) providing therapy to relieve stress and address shame; b) HAND screening referral and follow-up; and c) identifying social support opportunities. This presentation discusses how social workers can support clients concerning HIV, aging, and cognition in research and practice."

A rapid assessment and response system will utilize reportneedles.ca, a real-time geographic information system (GIS) to generate geo maps of hotspots where community needle prevalence in public spaces is the highest in Regina and compare these hotspots to service access. We will then deploy and evaluate pop-up point-of-care HIV and syphilis testing alongside the distribution of HIV self-testing kits and education on pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP and PEP). These pop-up interventions' feasibility (proportions of participation) and acceptability (participant satisfaction) will be assessed. The geospatial relationship between needle prevalence and access to care will be explored. HIV and syphilis testing and education will be delivered to 300 Regina residents in hotspot areas of community needle prevalence over 2.5 years. We will measure change in knowledge on PrEP and PEP. Positive results on HIV and syphilis tests will be linked to care at Regina General Hospital. We will explore the identification of previously undiagnosed HIV and syphilis cases amongst people who use injection drugs in Regina as a result of this study. Further, a purposive sample of participants will be invited to semi-structured, peer-facilitated interviews regarding substance use, sexual health, and service access. By empirically testing whether this rapid assessment and response system is feasible and beneficial, our community-based team aims to generate proof-of-concept for a cost-effective, GIS-based approach to HIV and syphilis prevention and to share knowledge for adaptation and implementation elsewhere."

These internally displaced persons (IDPs) have often experienced trauma and upheaval, now living in crowded camps with very limited resources and support. This has led to a mental health emergency - high levels of conditions like depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder among IDPs. Many also face daily struggles meeting basic needs, gender-based violence, unemployment, and lack of education access which erodes hope.

Our project aims to respond to this crisis through an intervention called RESETTLE-IDPs which will deliver life skills education and support groups to IDPs using both in-person and mobile technology platforms. Life skills training will equip IDPs with critical knowledge and capacities around communication, managing emotions, problem solving, advocacy, health practices, and more tailored to their displacement experiences and cultural context. This aims to improve their mental health, functioning, and skills to take charge of improving their own wellbeing despite the challenges.

We will co-design the program with IDPs to ensure it meets their needs and priorities. Local facilitators will be trained to deliver the life skills groups in a supportive way. RESETTLE-IDPs is unique in holistically addressing mental health and capacity as foundations for IDPs to sustainably thrive and integrate into their host communities, rather than just providing short-term relief aid.

The project will rigorously assess whether the mobile approach can be just as impactful as in-person groups, allowing support to those in remote camps. We will also evaluate the feasibility and costs to inform scaling and integration into national policies to sustain IDP mental health promotion long-term. Most importantly, RESETTLE-IDPs will empower IDPs as changemakers in creating more just, equitable communities during displacement crises."

These patients suffer from a variety of conditions including back pain and other chronic non-cancer pain, and mental illness such as depression and anxiety. Approximately 60-75% of the costs from disability claims are from 10% of claimants, demonstrating the importance of early identification of, and intervention with, this vulnerable group. Currently, no standardized approach exists for identifying high-risk claimants.

We are currently performing a systematic review evaluating studies that explored predictors of recovery among patients in receipt of disability benefits. The results obtained from our review will generate candidate criteria for identifying persons at high risk for prolonged recovery. We will use the candidate criteria to determine the extent to which information in existing databases from private insurers might serve to identify those at risk. We will then determine if the factors identified in the literature predict prolonged recovery among claimants represented in insurance company databases, and if additional factors not yet studied formally appear to have predictive value. The results of these studies will be used to inform the items for an instrument designed to identify claimants at high risk of prolonged recovery following receipt of disability benefits. We will then test the instrument using a cohort of patients in Canada and one in Switzerland. 

The results of this study will be of interest to insurance and compensation boards, researchers, clinicians and patients suffering from disabilities. Our study will be the first to develop an evidence-based tool to identify claimants at high risk of prolonged recovery. If successful, our instrument will identify high-risk claimants who can receive intensive rehabilitation efforts early on, which may result in an overall shorter duration of claims and an increased rate of successful claim resolution."

Despite the impact of SDHs on health, they are not routinely measured in many healthcare institutions across Canada and their importance is not well-known to the public. Over the past decade, there has been increasing interest in incorporating SDH screening into healthcare and using this information to prescribe social services to address SDH-related needs (i.e., social prescription) and improve patient health. One example of a social prescription program is the Health Connections program in Mendip, England which successfully reduced community emergency department visits by 14%. This program also involved community members who helped people connect with social services after social prescriptions were provided. In partnership with several community and healthcare organizations, we propose to use Quality Improvement (QI) approaches as a foundation for the co-design of an implementation and evaluation program of social prescribing at a secondary (e.g., Diabetes Clinic) and tertiary (e.g., Stroke Clinic) health care setting in the Kingston Health Sciences Centre (KHSC). To facilitate follow-up for social prescriptions, this program will also involve a system of community volunteers who can connect patients to social services. The following objectives will be addressed by the planning phase of this project: 1) nurture collaborative and respectful partnerships with representatives of marginalized communities to enable co-development and person-focused research; 2) build a system of networking between project partners to develop an over-arching project strategy and timeline for the implementation phase, and; 3) develop a CIHR project grant application (within the Global Health Areas) to implement and evaluate our unique approach to a community-integrated social prescribing program."

The Speakers Bureau provides a platform for people with histories of homelessness and mental illness to engage with the community, open the dialogue on issues related to mental health and homelessness, and discuss the impact of Housing First in their lives - an emerging service model that serves to transition the most vulnerable homeless individuals into permanent housing. This proposal aims to extend the reach of the Bureau by connecting Speakers Bureau members to researchers, and provide new opportunities to co-present their 'insider' knowledge alongside the dissemination of study results to diverse audiences in policy, academic and non-academic settings. Involving peers in knowledge dissemination activities will advance mutual learning, promote more informed and balanced policy discussions, and share power in decision-making with people who have historically been excluded from conversations about the development of policies and programming that directly impacts their lives."
Characterizing Gender Differences among the Homeless Mentally Ill: The First Members of a Vancouver Cohort,"['Eiboff, Faith L']",['N/A'],"['Gender And Health', 'Gender-Based Analysis', 'Homelessness', 'Housing First', 'Mental Health And Addictions', 'Population And Public Health', 'Supported Housing']",17500.0,201596,"Relatively little is known about the characteristics, experiences or patterns of homelessness among Canadian women. Rates of homelessness continue to increase across Canada each year, however, and the number of homeless women are also steadily increasing--particularly in Vancouver's downtown core. The homeless have an increased risk of suffering from mental illness and addictions, chronic health conditions, sexual abuse/violence and premature death in comparison to the general population-with homeless women experiencing more significant distress and major depression than homeless men. Although increasing evidence suggests that the homeless mentally ill are able to maintain long-term housing in the community, preliminary research suggests that housing interventions have different trajectories between homeless men and women. Very few studies to date have explored gender differences in housing outcomes, however. This research project will provide a systematic gender analysis of the first 100-200 Vancouver participants drawn from a population-based study-the At Home/Chez Soi Mental Health Commission Canada (MHCC) National Homelessness Demonstration Project, part of a Canadian five-city randomized controlled trial, over four-years, comparing different models of housing and supports among the homeless mentally ill. The analysis will compare differences between participants on a comprehensive set of health, social and clinical measures, as previous research suggests that undetected differences in functioning may influence poorer housing outcomes among homeless women. It is predicted that homeless women will report greater functional impairment compared to homeless men with similar psychiatric diagnoses. As evidence continues to implicate homelessness with poor health, gender-specific data will assist with implementing the housing and service needs required for homeless women to successfully achieve long-term recovery, in a Canadian and more localized context."
Housing and Health-Related Trajectories among Homeless Women Struggling with Mental Illness and Addictions: A Trauma-Informed Perspective,"['Eiboff, Faith L']",['N/A'],"['Cumulative Abuse', 'Gender And Health', 'Homelessness', 'Housing First', 'Latent Class Analysis', 'Mental Health And Addictions', 'Recovery', 'Trauma', 'Violence']",105000.0,283816,"Homeless women with mental illness are a highly vulnerable population struggling with poverty, violence and trauma, and are often disengaged from the current system of care. The realities of homeless women's lives present multiple barriers to the access and uptake of essential services, which can compound health risks and compromise health and mental health outcomes. This is important, as the number of homeless women has increased more than men in the last ten years in Vancouver. This research will explore the impact of violence and trauma among a cohort of homeless women with mental illness. The research will draw from data collected at the Vancouver site of the At Home/Chez Soi National Research Demonstration project - a randomised controlled trial investigating mental health and homelessness over two years, funded by the Mental Health Commission of Canada. Early findings indicate high rates of post-traumatic stress (40%) and partner violence (65%) among the women, and significantly greater incidents of sexual violence and violent victimization. Many women have attributed these experiences as directly related to becoming homeless. Utilising the statistical method of latent cluster analysis, this project will identify patterns of cumulative violence, trauma and abuse among participants, and link to trajectories of homeless women's service utilisation, residential stability and health-related outcomes. It is expected that women with more extensive and severe histories of violence and trauma will be less engaged with essential health care services and supports, resulting in compromised housing, health and mental health outcomes. Given the magnitude of the preventable health and social costs of homelessness, this research will generate gender-specific evidence to inform Canadian housing and health-related policy and address inequities in health among a highly disadvantaged, and currently underserved, group of women."

Each year, half of all smokers try to quit.  Half of those trying to quit use mainstream smoking cessation aids.  These conventional aids, or products that make it easier to quit smoking, include drugs, nicotine inhalers, and behavioral therapy.  Some smokers, however, turn toward more unusual smoking cessation aids:  acupuncture (including electro-acupuncture and laser therapy), electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes), hypnosis, and rapid smoking.  These unconventional treatments are becoming more and more popular.  However, they are expensive, and their usefulness remains unclear.  There is a pressing need to determine how effective each treatment is.  We will do this by combining and summarizing information from previously published studies.  We will rank the unconventional smoking cessation aids in order of effectiveness and compare them to conventional treatments.  We will provide clear recommendations about these aids to physicians, policy makers, and millions of Canadian smokers.  The conclusions from our trial could help individual smokers quit more easily, and reduce the overall burden of smoking on the healthcare system."

Although several interventions have been proposed, Canada lacks a comprehensive strategy to adequately manage this epidemic. Thus, it is imperative to evaluate current interventions for this crisis and to make explicit evidence-based recommendations for future strategies. Unless more efficient approaches are urgently considered, Canada will continue to face a broad expansion of opioid use and related harms. Our systematic review will evaluate the effectiveness of interventions in the general population and vulnerable sub-populations (individuals with low socioeconomic status or mental illness, women, and youth). We will also examine how current interventions are implemented in Canada in order to tailor recommendations for the Canadian context. We will search electronic databases and the grey literature for Canadian or American studies addressing interventions for the opioid crisis. We will classify interventions according to three domains: clinical, policy, and public health, and will consider both licit and illicit opioid use. The GRADE framework will then be employed to structure our recommendations, in consultation with our knowledge users at Health Canada and the Canadian Task Force of Preventive Health Care. Using an integrated knowledge translation approach, we plan to facilitate the dissemination and exchange of our findings through several outlets, including end-of-grant knowledge translation activities with other researchers, physicians, and the public. Our proposed study, in line with the mission of the Canadian Drugs and Substances Strategy, has great potential to improve current policy and inform treatment guidelines. Our expected findings will add to the debate regarding suitable interventions for the opioid crisis, identify avenues for future research, and ultimately contribute to minimizing opioid-related harms in Canada."

We will conduct systematic and scoping reviews of the literature concerning cannabis and impaired driving. This includes the detection and prevention of cannabis-impaired driving, identification of gaps in knowledge, and the provision of recommendations for harm reduction in Canada. Our research is designed to answer the following questions:

1.What measures and/or tools are available for the detection of cannabis-impaired driving, and how well do these measures work?
2.What is the impact of public health approaches (e.g., mass media campaigns, youth education programs) for the prevention of cannabis-impaired driving?
3.What is the role of primary care physicians in preventing impaired driving?

Literature reviews are the first step in establishing what evidence exists, the quality of this evidence, and what gaps in knowledge require future research to address. Our reviews will include searching databases as well as governmental and organizational publications. If collected data are similar, it may be possible to perform meta-analyses to pool and compare our findings. The project will require 18 months to complete.

Our proposal addresses the needs of knowledge users at Health Canada and the Canadian Task Force for Preventive Health Care for literature reviews concerning cannabis-impaired driving. The full development of this proposal included a librarian, epidemiologist, ethicist, statistician, diagnostic test accuracy and knowledge translation experts, as well as knowledge users. Based on our findings, we will make recommendations, suggest avenues for future research, and inform the debate for appropriate health policy and practice in Canada. Our findings will ultimately contribute to the larger goal of reducing harms associated with recreational cannabis legalization."
Social Network and Support Experiences of Older African Refugees in Calgary: A Graphic Visual Inquiry,"['Ekoh, Prince C']",['N/A'],"['Ageing', 'Social Gerontology']",768.0,476201,"Globally, the number of refugees is increasing. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reported that about 26 million persons lived outside their countries' borders at the end of 2021 due to conflicts, human rights violations and generalised violence. Older people make up an estimated four per cent of global refugees, yet they receive very little scholarly attention because their needs are not deemed as necessary as that of other vulnerable groups such as women and children. This leaves them at risk of falling through the gaps of support and care. Anchored on the theories of Ubuntu and intersectionality, this proposed phenomenological study will adopt art-based storytelling and graphics to explore the social network and support experiences of African refugees aged 50 years and over living in Calgary. This study will investigate the nature of social support received during the migration and postmigration periods. The impact of decreased support networks on their mental health and quality of life will also be explored. This proposed research aims to contribute to the established knowledge deficit on older refugees by highlighting the roles of older African refugees' current social networks and support to their well-being, how forced migration may have changed their social networks and support, and the gaps in support it may have created. The findings will aid immigrant serving agencies, social workers, multidisciplinary gerontologists and policymakers to design and provide ethnic and culture-sensitive programmes to support older African refugees and older refugees of other ethnicities."
How does gender influence the mental health of refugees in St. John's?

However, refugees experience many risks to their mental health, such as trauma in their home country, the stress of moving to a new country and leaving loved ones behind, as well as the difficulties of settling into a new context. Past research has found that refugee men and women experience these stresses differently, so mental health services need to take gender into account when working with refugees. In the city of St. John's, Newfoundland, there are no mental health services that cater to the city's refugee residents. This research project will use interviews to learn about refugee men and women's experiences of mental health in St. John's, with the goal of understanding how mental health services can best serve refugees in the city. As such, the results of this research project can improve mental health services for refugees in St. John's, helping them reach their full potential."

Our study will attempt to answer this question by looking at the medical records of deliveries across all institutions in the province of Ontario, comparing mothers who did and did not use cannabis. We will follow the children over several years to monitor changes in their health and development. Our results will inform women, medical practitioners, and the government on the risks of cannabis use in pregnancy and provide the best information for pregnant women and their providers to make safe and healthy decisions in pregnancy."

This is an unprecedented opportunity to study a major public transport project of this scale in the Canadian context. The last time a major public transport project of this size was built in the 1970s. The lessons it will teach are particularly timely. Even before the REM's completion, regional and provincial officials are already discussing expansions. At the same time, the federal government is pledging to support similar projects across Canada as part of its efforts to improve equity and combat the climate crisis. To our knowledge, no comprehensive study has been planned to fully assess the REM's possibly profound impacts on travel behaviour and public health. Several sections of the REM are already under construction and slated to open in 2021. Construction on others has yet to begin, giving us a brief window to conduct research to measure how the REM's impact is felt at various stages of development and operation.

Differences in Immune Reactivity to Respiratory Challenges in Asthmatic Patients with and without Panic Disorder,"['Elhalwi, Alexandre']",['N/A'],"['Anxiety', 'Asthma', 'Behavioral Medicine', 'Health Psychology', 'Immune System', 'Panic Disorder', 'Respiratory System', 'Stress']",17500.0,278578,"Asthma is a chronic airway disease characterized by the walls of the airway narrowing and having inflammation (the process which normally repairs damaged cells in the body but can be dangerous when it goes wrong, as in asthma). This condition affects over 8% of Canadians over the age of 12, with more than half of those people having difficulty controlling their asthma symptoms, despite many using asthma medication. The reasons for this lack of control remain poorly understood. Patients with asthma tend to have more mental health problems (e.g., psychiatric disorders) than the general population and these kinds of problems have been shown to worsen asthma symptoms. For example, panic disorder (PD) is up to six times more common in asthmatics than in the general population. This high rate is thought to be in part due to the fact that asthma and panic attacks have similar characteristic symptoms: anxiety, difficulty breathing, and chest tightness. While this similarity may cause patients and their doctors to misinterpret the nature of an attack (be it asthma or panic), it is also possible that panic attacks may trigger asthma attacks. It is possible that that a sudden stressful event, such as a panic attack, may cause an increase in inflammation, thus worsening the person's asthma. Identifying the links between panic and asthma attacks may lead to better and quicker treatment, and may help doctors distinguish asthma-related and PD-related attacks more effectively, which is particularly important in the Emergency Department. This work may also lead to the development of tools for patients, ultimately helping them to better understand their symptoms as asthma-related or not, which would in turn help them to make better medical decisions (e.g., choosing to go to the Emergency Department or not) and lead to reductions in unnecessary medical use."

Research on the biopsychosocial basis of affiliation offers important insight into the pathophysiology of mental disorders associated with social dysfunction, such as major depression. The neuropeptide oxytocin is widely believed to have a central role in promoting affiliative behavior. However, recent studies in humans have also reported negative findings associated with the administration of oxytocin, suggesting that our understanding of oxytocin may need to be modified. We propose that the response to the administration of an oxytocin nasal spray can be used to assess for abnormalities in the oxytocin system. More specifically, we will attempt, for the first time, to link oxytocin-induced changes in how people perceive and interpret emotional pictures to future changes in their interpersonal relations and clinical symptoms. The study will track social behavior in previously-depressed and never-depressed healthy young adults for 18 months, and will assess whether the cognitive response to oxytocin can predict interpersonal difficulties and symptoms of depression six to 18 months later. The proposed research is important because it is the first study to explicitly assess the clinical relevance of studying challenges to this important neurobiological system. It represents a novel approach to studying interpersonal vulnerability, and has important implications for understanding depression. If the response to an oxytocin challenge signifies vulnerability for interpersonal problems and depression, the procedure could be used in the context of identifying people who would benefit from preventative interventions."

In addition to stopping the spread of COVID-19, these programs have shown improved outcomes when compared to the standard congregate shelter program, including reduced 911 calls, fewer overdoses, and increased permanent housing. Understanding how these programs were implemented may allow for their continuation and expansion beyond the pandemic. 
What is the overall goal? We will work with community partners to examine initiatives in two mid-sized Ontario cities that have adopted integrated health and non-congregate sheltering models during COVID-19. We will learn how the programs were implemented, what resources are required, and what would be needed to sustain the programs post-pandemic. We will interview program staff members (including healthcare providers, shelter workers, and administrative staff) and clients to learn about their experiences implementing the program and will examine program documentation such as meeting minutes, reports, policies and budgets to better understand the process, planning, costs and policies that are associated with the program. We will use all of the information gathered to create a guide to share with other regions interested in developing and implementing a similar model.
What is the expected impact? Our project will yield an in-depth understanding of integrative health and sheltering programs developed in response to the pandemic and will learn how these programs can be successfully implemented and sustained."

The proposed research initiative centres on implementing the Dr. Peter Centre's Model of Care and evaluating its impact on the well-being of a diverse cohort of 150 clients over time.

Envisioned as a five-year, mixed-method community-based study, the initiative integrates qualitative and quantitative data, ensuring a nuanced understanding of health outcomes. Emphasizing engagement with people with lived/living experience (PWLLE), the project actively involves a diverse cohort in governance structures, leadership positions, and advisory committees, reflecting considerations of equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI).

The research team, drawn from diverse backgrounds across the country/province, aims to create a platform for collective reflection on knowledge translation practices. Embracing inclusivity, the team comprises early career researchers, Indigenous representatives, PWLLE, and experts focused on Sexually Transmitted and Blood-Borne Infections (STBBI). Indigenous representation enriches the decision-making process, contributing significantly to building capacity for Indigenous Health Research."

SLE is an autoimmune condition which primarily impacts women, particularly women of colour, and is highly variable. SLE can be mild to severe, and symptoms are often invisible. SLE comes with unique physical, emotional, social and financial challenges; in particular, a lack of awareness and education surrounding SLE - for both patients and their communities - is a major barrier to health and wellbeing. Our research has revealed that worldwide, people with SLE accessed news/social media for health information more frequently during the pandemic, even though they trusted these sources less than physicians. Further, one major impact of SLE is the high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), but many patients and healthcare providers lack knowledge around risk and management strategies for this group. In this Café, we aim to empower the SLE community by presenting evidence-based information around these topics. In partnership with Lupus Canada, we have developed two lay documents presenting our research results specific to SLE: one discussing health (mis)information, and one describing CVD in SLE. In addition, we have assembled a panel of SLE experts (physicians, researchers) and knowledge users (people with lived experience: patient partner, advocacy, and youth representatives) to discuss their ongoing research and learnings. Throughout this event we will foster dialogue among and between researchers and attendees during refreshment breaks and interactive activities. Both during and after the event, we will provide attendees with the opportunity to provide feedback about the event, as well as areas for future research. This event will be held in a hybrid (in-person and virtual) format at an accessible Calgary Public Library. location."
Early-Life Environment and Chronic Allergic Disease: Leveraging a Prospective Study to Discover the Epigenetic Signatures,"['Ellis, Anne K', 'Diamond, Miriam']","['Brook, Jeffrey R', 'Kobor, Michael S', 'North, Michelle L']","['Air Pollution', 'Allergy', 'Birth Cohort', 'Childhood Development', 'Dendritic Cells', 'Early Life Exposures', 'Environmental Health', 'Epigenetics']",100000.0,285352,"This project seeks to examine the effects of early-life exposures on allergic disease in a group of 350 children that we have been following since before birth. At age 2 we will measure outdoor traffic-related air pollution and indoor levels of environmental chemicals at the homes of the children. At the same time we will collect blood samples. We propose to investigate a mechanism called epigenetics as a mediator of gene-environment interactions. Epigenetic modifications are changes that affect gene expression that do not involve changes in the DNA code. Epigenetic modifications are highly dependent on both environment and cell type. We propose to look at epigenetics in dendritic cells, a specific cell type that lies at the interface between the individual and the environment. Dendritic cells encounter both pollutants and potential allergens and influence the immune response. We will test the hypothesis that distinct epigenetic patterns, potentially induced by the environment, are associated with health outcomes and the development of allergies."
Genetic modifiers of caffeine intake and cardiovascular disease risk,"['El-Sohemy, Ahmed']","['Fontaine-Bisson, Bénédicte', 'Sun, Guang']","['Blood Pressure', 'Caffeine', 'Cardiovascular Disease', 'Gene-Environment Interaction', 'Genetic Polymorphisms', 'Hypertension', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Population Health']",340311.0,238978,"Caffeine is the most widely consumed stimulant in the world. It is found naturally in coffee, tea and cocoa, and is added to cola beverages and energy drinks. There is increased concern that caffeine may negatively affect our cardiovascular system, however, studies have given conflicting results. Recent research has shown that this effect relates to how caffeine is broken down (metabolized) in the body. People who break it down slowly are at greater risk of heart disease whereas those who break it down quickly seem to be protected. Interestingly, the breakdown of caffeine has little to do with its physical effects on the body, such as alertness and withdrawal, and genes relating to these other effects have yet to be studied. We hypothesize that variation exists in important genes that are involved in both caffeine metabolism and its physical effects on the body, and that these genetic differences also modify the relationship between caffeine intake and the risk of high blood pressure and heart disease. The objective of this research is to determine whether these genetic variations alter the relationship between caffeine intake and disease in large populations of healthy young and older adults living in Canada, adults with high blood pressure in Italy, and those who have had a heart attack in Costa Rica. Given the significant burden of heart disease in Canada and the widespread consumption of caffeine our results will allow us to identify individuals who are more susceptible to disease based on their genes and dietary habits. This information is needed to establish improved guidelines to minimize the risk of cardiovascular disease in vulnerable populations."

Older adults newly diagnosed with dementia represent a vulnerable group where optimizing medication therapy throughout disease progression is critical. Inappropriate prescribing for this population has been associated with adverse health outcomes, including hospitalizations, falls, and mortality. Psychotropic, or central nervous system active, medications are particularly associated with falls in older adults. Two gaps exist in current research: 1) a lack of methods which capture broader prescribing context over time and 2) patient and care partner perspectives are seldom integrated in research studies on inappropriate prescribing, despite importance of patient engagement. This project will apply machine learning approaches, such as network analysis and optimal matching algorithms, to discover prevalent but understudied medication combinations, to better define exposure to medications over time, and compare the impact of different exposure definitions on the rate of fall-related hospitalizations. The Engagement of People with Lived Experience of Dementia (EPLED, https://www.epled.ca/), a Canadian Consortium of Neurodegeneration in Aging (CCNA) program which brings those with lived experience of dementia and their care partners, will be consulted during all stages of the research process."

We all either know someone with OA or suffer from it ourselves. A 2011 study by the Canadian Arthritis Alliance reported that approximately 4.6 million Canadians suffer from OA and that this number, and the cost to society associated with caring for OA, are expected to double over the next generation. Many things contribute to the development of OA, but one common risk factor is joint injury suffered in youth during sport or recreational activities. In fact, 50% of individuals who experience a significant knee injury go on to develop OA. Youth who experience joint injuries may reveal important clues about how joint injury leads to OA. This information could be used to slow down or prevent the disease. 

There are many potential reasons why some individuals go on to develop OA after a knee joint injury while others do not. For example, joint trauma has been associated with changes in how the trunk (abdominal and back), hip and knee muscles function. There are also some studies that suggest joint injury may lead to changes in blood chemistry, participation in physical activity, fitness level, beliefs about injury, and the use of the health care system. The goal of this research is to develop a better understanding of the interaction between the physical, structural, chemical and behavioral implications of joint injury and how these relate to developing OA. We will examine how young adults who sustained a knee injury 3-10 years ago in their youth differ in physical activity participation, fitness, body composition, blood chemistry, ability to perform movement tests, muscle structure as well as beliefs about injury, sport participation and health care use compared to those who did not experience a knee injury.

Evaluating the impact of front-of-pack nutrition rating systems on the food choices and dietary intakes of Canadians,"['Emrich, Teri']",['N/A'],"['Canadian Community Health Survey - Cycle 2.2 (Nutrition)', 'Consumer Research', 'Food And Nutrition Labelling', 'Food Choice', 'Food Label Database', 'Food Regulations', 'Front-Of-Pack Labelling', 'Nutrition Information', 'Statistical Modelling', 'Surveys']",70000.0,258466,"Nutrition logos and symbols provide simple nutrition information on food packages.  Front-of-pack logos have been proposed as a public health strategy to reduce diet-related chronic disease by helping consumers easily identify healthier products.  A variety of nutrition logos have been in use in Canada since 1999, but little is known about consumers' exposure to these logos and their effectiveness in guiding consumers toward healthier foods. Hypothesis: Considering front-of-pack logos' potential as a public health intervention, describing and evaluating the logos currently in use can inform nutrition labelling policy in Canada. I will use 3 distinct approaches to describe and evaluate Canada's current front-of-pack environment. 1) Nutrition logo effectiveness: 2500 Canadians have been surveyed on their use of logos, liking, trust, and understanding of logos, and how well logos help them choose healthier products, as well as preferences related to the use of nutrition logos in the marketplace. 2) Nutrition logo prevalence/healthfulness: Using a University of Toronto database of more than 10,000 foods sold in Canada, food packages will be visually analyzed to determine the prevalence of nutrition logos.  Products with and without logos will be compared according to nutrition criteria (including calories, fat, saturated and trans-fat, cholesterol, sodium, fibre, and sugars).  Statistical tests will be done to determine if products bearing logos are, on average, healthier than those without. 3) Impact of nutrition logos on nutrient intakes: The criteria used to place nutrition logos on foods will be applied to food intake data from a national health survey to find out if diets would improve if all or some of the foods consumed by Canadians met nutrition logo criteria. Significance: The results of my research will inform nutrition labelling policy on logos by determining if they help consumers implement dietary recommendations for the prevention of chronic disease."

A telehealth intervention to promote healthy lifestyles after stroke,"['Eng, Janice J', 'Lear, Scott A']","['Yao, Jennifer K', 'Barr, Susan I', 'Benavente, Oscar', 'Goldsmith, Charles H', 'Silverberg, Noah']","['Aging', 'Chronic Disease', 'Life-Style Intervention', 'Self-Management', 'Stroke']",307263.0,304957,"BACKGROUND: The lifetime risk of stroke is 1 in 5 for women and 1 in 6 for men over age 55.  The vast majority of individuals with stroke are not engaging in healthy lifestyles and are at high risk for serious psychosocial and physical complications.  As a result, the majority of stroke survivors are physically inactive; 30% have depression; 13% fall and fracture; and 30% go on to have another stroke due to poor cardiovascular health (diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity).  

PURPOSE: This study will be the first study to determine the effects of a comprehensive telehealth program on changing lifestyle behaviour for community-dwelling individuals with stroke. This program will offer specific knowledge and choices that consider the needs of the stroke survivor, and their family/caregiver.

METHODS: Community-dwelling individuals with stroke will be randomly assigned to the Healthy Lifestyle Telehealth Program or control group.  Individuals in the Healthy Lifestyle Telehealth group will participate in a 6 month tailored educational and behavioral counseling program for lifestyle modification delivered by telephone. Self-monitoring will be facilitated with a kit containing simple monitoring resources. We will determine whether the Healthy Lifestyle Telehealth Program will improve lifestyle behaviours such as physical activity, dietary habits, and medication adherence, as well as cardiovascular health outcomes, quality of life and health care costs. 

SIGNIFICANCE: The actual delivery cost of this service is relatively low and the telehealth approach would allow the program to reach a large number of Canadians living with stroke in both urban and rural regions. This comprehensive stroke-specific telehealth program has the potential to improve health behaviours of people living with stroke, reduce the risks of psychosocial and physical complications that frequently occur after stroke, and improve the quality of life after stroke."
Prenatal exposure to plastic chemical mixtures is related to DNA methylation variation in genes associated with neuroendocrine function and neurodevelopment,"['England-Mason, Gillian']",['N/A'],"['Behaviour', 'Child Development', 'Cognitive', 'Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals', 'Environmental Influences On Health', 'Epigenetics', 'Neurodevelopment', 'Prenatal Exposure', 'Sex Differences']",90000.0,454443,"Children's healthy development is very sensitive to exposure to environmental chemicals during pregnancy. Prenatal exposure to plastic chemicals, including bisphenol A (BPA) and phthalates, is unavoidable due to their widespread use in food and beverage packing, clothing and building materials, and personal care products. These plastic chemicals can cross the placenta and affect the activity of genes critical for the regulation of hormones and brain development. This in turn could influence the development of children's cognitive abilities and behaviour. Prenatal exposure to plastic chemicals has been associated with adverse effects on children's neurodevelopment and mental health, including a higher risk for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The effect of early exposure to plastic chemicals on the activity of genes is poorly understood and could be different for boys and girls. To better understand this issue, already collected data on prenatal exposure to plastic chemicals, gene activity from infant DNA samples, and children's cognitive, behavioural, and motor outcomes at 2, 3-4, and 5-7 years of age will be used. I will investigate the associations between prenatal exposure to plastic chemicals, the activity of genes, and children's cognitive, behavioural, and motor development. The results of this research could provide evidence that the activity of genes is a possible causal link between prenatal exposure to plastic chemicals and adverse neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes in children. This information could be used to help guide the Government of Canada's chemical management plans for plastic chemicals, pinpoint targets of intervention to alter neurodevelopmental trajectories, and improve health outcomes for Canadian children."

We will also examine how theatre and other arts-based methods engage Indigenous youth in healthy decision-making. The researchers will collaborate with youth to determine the specifics of the research project within the parameters set by the overall design. In collaboration with the youth participants, we will share our findings with other Aboriginal youth, community members, and policy makers."
Dog Days: Discussions on Sustainable Animal Management in First Nations Communities,"['Epp, Tasha Y']",['N/A'],"['Dog Bite Prevention And Population Control', 'First Nations Communities', 'Sustainable Animal Management']",5000.0,246062,"First Nations people, particularly in Canada's north, have in the past depended on dogs for protection, companionship and transportation. Dogs continue to play an important role in these communities, providing personal, cultural, recreational, and economic benefits. The issues faced by this population of animals and their interactions with humans are not widely documented; exceptions are, canine overpopulation and resulting unprovoked, often fatal attacks on aboriginal children. First Nation communities have recognized and attempted to address these issues for years; unfortunately, the limited resources available for dog management have been ineffective for many communities. The vision for this two day conference is to promote discussions within the communities, within academia, within the medical and veterinary profession and between all of these stakeholders on sustainable animal management options. By starting a dialogue between communities and interested stakeholders, research collaborations or solution based partnerships can be initiated that could have long-lasting impacts on the health of animal and human individuals in these communities or the overall health of the whole community."

The removal of Dakelh midwives from practice in Dakelh territory is the result of processes of colonization as well as Euro-western biomedical domination. This research seeks to revive Dakelh midwifery by implementing a culturally relevant, evidence-based, trauma-informed, community-led Dakelh Doula training curriculum. This research recognizes the social impacts of colonization, including birth evacuation policies, the opioid epidemic, and the COVID-19 pandemic, which underscore the urgent need for Indigenous-led perinatal care. 
The research asks fundamental questions: How can implementation science principles be effectively integrated into the Dakelh Doula Training curriculum? Will the program enhance perinatal outcomes and inspire Dakelh people to advocate for birth sovereignty?
Methodologically, the research draws upon decolonizing and ""Dakelh-izing"" Implementation Science. The implementation will measure specifically, the enhancement of safety, advocacy, economic opportunities, and cultural knowledge. This process will be guided by community-based participatory research protocols an centre Dakelh governance protocols. 
 Indigenous feminist, decolonizing, and critical race theoretical underpinnings guide this work. This research seeks to emphasizes collaboration with Dakelh knowledge holders and integrates community perspectives into the training process.
The project's impact extends beyond research outcomes; it promotes cultural revitalization, addresses healthcare disparities, and empowers Dakelh communities. A decolonized knowledge sharing plan ensures Indigenous voices remain central throughout the dissemination process, fostering reciprocal learning and respectful engagement. In summary, this research represents a vital step towards reclaiming Dakelh midwifery, promoting health equity, and fostering self-determination within Indigenous communities."

The complications appear to be similar across the diseases, suggesting that low grade ongoing inflammation may be the culprit. The diseases we will study affect over 5 million Canadians. They include psoriasis (a skin disease); rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and lupus-like diseases, ankylosing spondylitis, gout and osteoarthritis (joint diseases); and Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (bowel diseases).
We focus on complications that occur in a greater frequency than would be expected by chance, including heart attacks, strokes, blood clots in the legs and lungs, severe infections, hip fractures, selected cancers, diabetes, and chronic lung disease. 

We will do the following:
1. Find out how common these complications are and their true impact on individuals, including the financial costs.
2. Find out whether inflammation is in fact the cause of the complications and whether there are other factors that can either increase the risk of the complications or eliminate them. More than 500,000 Canadians (1 in 10 of those affected) will be studied.
3. Develop patient-centred approaches to reduce or eliminate the frequency and consequences of the complications. With prompt diagnosis and more knowledge, prevention is possible; five million Canadians could live better, longer lives and money will be saved by not treating complications that do not occur.  

Our team of over 30 scientists and patients have been working for a decade on identifying the complications and doing test runs that show this is doable. Four patients have been involved in every step of the study design. They have surveyed another 636 patients to assist in making sure the questions asked are truly relevant to all Canadians with these diseases.  

This research has the potential to save lives."

OA occurs when the cartilage (the gristle that lines the ends of the bone) is damaged. OA is the most common form of hip arthritis and responsible for more than 90% of hip replacements (more than 21,000 hip replacements are done per year in Canada). Recently, subtle deformities of the hip have been linked to hip OA. It is believed that certain types of physical activity such as hockey, soccer and bicycling combine with the deformity to cause hip damage. 

The goal of this CIHR team is to show how physical activity while interacting with one or more subtle deformities can cause cartilage damage and eventually OA. We will determine the frequency of the deformities in the population, compare the frequency in groups thought to have a lower frequency (Chinese) or higher frequency (Aboriginal Peoples) of OA compared to Caucasians and see if physical activity over one's lifetime is important in causing hip pain and eventually hip OA.  

In addition, we will: 1) See how the physical motion and the deformity combine to damage cartilage using Canada's only magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine that allows testing with the person standing up and with movement; 2) Use new techniques that show changes in the cartilage even though it is normal on a regular MRI; and, 3) Get the results out to Canadians better than has ever been done before.

These questions will be addressed by a collaborative team of researchers from four medical specialties (orthopaedics, rheumatology, physiotherapy, radiology), six research disciplines (basic and clinical sciences, population health, epidemiology, biostatistics, health services research and knowledge translation), as well as stakeholders from the arthritis community. This research program will generate the new knowledge needed for major breakthroughs in the prevention, detection and treatment of hip OA."

Recent research proposes that femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) of the hip may be a major cause of hip pain and a precursor for the majority of unexplained (primary) OA of the hip. It has been suggested that FAI may be associated with physical activities, such as hockey, soccer and bicycling, all of which are conducted in considerable and repetitive hip flexion, but a direct causal link has never been shown. Confirmation of the specific activities that lead to symptomatic FAI opens the possibility for altered physical activity to reduce hip OA in the population.

The goal of this CIHR team is to advance the knowledge of the role of physical activity in causing symptomatic FAI, and subsequently hip OA, by developing a cohort of individuals with hip pain in British Columbia. The prevalence of FAI in the population will be calculated. In addition we will estimate the prevalence of FAI in ethnic groups that are known to have lower or higher prevalence of OA (Chinese and Aboriginal groups, respectively). 

Other innovative aspects of this research program include the opportunity to: 1) explore the dynamic nature of the actual impingement caused by FAI using Canada's only research-directed vertical gap open magnetic resonance (MR) imager; and 2) assess the pathogenesis of cartilage damage using molecular biomarkers and newly developed imaging techniques (e.g., dGEMRIC, qMR).

This complex and important question will be addressed by a collaborative team of researchers from 4 disciplinary groups (basic sciences; clinical sciences; population health, epidemiology and biostatistics; health services research and knowledge translation) and stakeholders from the arthritis community. We envision that this research program will generate the necessary new knowledge leading to major breakthrough in the prevention, detection and treatment of hip OA."

Few school based programs have been developed and tested that are aimed at reducing the risk for Aboriginal youth, especially those living in rural communities. Fewer still involve interventions that are peer-led and reliant upon the strengths, energy, and talents of the youth themselves. Building on the successes of a communal, relationship based approach to Aboriginal youth mentoring in an after school physical activity program (AYMP), we are evaluating a peer-led approach for diabetes prevention in Aboriginal schools. With the support of adult community members, high school volunteer as mentors, and develop an after-school physical activity, nutrition and education program that they then deliver to children in grade 4 at a neighbouring school. The high school mentors meet twice a week. The first day, they develop an activity plan which emphasizes vigorously active low organized games and healthy nutrition; together, the mentors decide roles and responsibilities to ensure successful delivery of each activity. The second day, they deliver the program for the children.The project incorporates a community-based participatory action research model that is informed by indigenous teachings, values and worldviews."

A comprehensive literature review and a survey conducted in 2014 on New Brunswick nursing homes, indicated staff members lack training in, and resources for addressing ethical issues they encounter in practice. E:learning is frequently used in LTC, but there is little such provision regarding ethics. As a result, a three-month, standalone e:learning training program is being developed based on data previously gathered from staff members discussing experiences of ethical issues in LTC. The training has ten modules which explores the topic of ethics. Focus groups and interviews will be conducted to explore what changes, if any, in participants' ethical reasoning can be identified following engagement with the e:learning materials, the strengths and weaknesses of e:learning in ethics training, and staff members perceptions regarding e:learning in relation to developing ethical practice. Interview and focus group data will be compared with the previous interviews and focus group data to determine whether participants have enhanced ethical awareness indicated by the application of skills from the training through the recognition of ethical issues, the use of ethical concepts, more ethically-nuanced language, the use of principles, the consideration of alternative frameworks in discussing ethical issues, and more nuanced and robust justifications used in ethical decision-making. Residents and staff members of LTC will benefit as ethical issues may be addressed consistently thus enhancing the quality of care provided and staff may feel better prepared to approach and resolve ethical issues, thus reducing moral distress. Lastly, the issue of knowledge mobilization will be addressed."

In the United States ADEs have shown to contribute to approximately 9 million hospitalization annually. In recent years, pharamcoepidemiologic studies that use health care administrative databases have provided valuable information on drug adverse events. Many of these studies have been published in the area of chronic diseases in older adults. In fact, numerous studies and initiatives have been focused on clinically important but drug ADEs that affect Women's Health. For example, The Women's Health Initiative was a large randomized controlled trial that addressed many health related issues including the effect of hormone replacement therapy and various forms of cancers in women. Unfortunately, similar initiatives that that focus on examining ADEs in older men are absent. This is in light of the fact that millions of prescriptions are written annually in Canada and United States for alpha blockers and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs), one of the most prescribed classes of drugs used by older men. Both these drug classes have been linked to serious adverse events including cancer, liver injury and various ocular diseases through case reports submitted to the Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada. Currently, large epidemiologic studies that have examined these adverse events in a real clinical setting are absent. The primary objective of this grant is to bring together experts in the area of clinical pharmacology, pharmacoepidemiology, biostatatistics, knowledge translation, drug policy and urology. Specifically we plan to 1) discuss the creation of the first drug safety initiative in older men;2) discuss and outline specific methodological approaches for each study question;3) identify potential funding opportunities for each study question.

However, these studies have shown conflicting results mainly due to limitations in their study methodology including having small sample sizes which prevented the study to convincingly show whether TNFi increases MS risk. The incidence of RD and IBD is increasing in Canada and United States. This means that the number of patients with RD and IBD on TNFi therapy is increasing possibly putting them at an unnecessary risk for developing MS. Our study will be the first to identify a possible modifiable risk factor (TNFi use) for MS in a population of patients already afflicted with a chronic disease and a high burden of illness (RD or IBD). In case our study identifies an increase in the risk of MS with TNFi use, this study can quantify the potential risk of MS with TNFi and allow for clinicians to better inform this risk to their patients.

Although these guidelines have been useful in developed countries like Canada and the US, it has changed public ideas about infant feeding and represents a threat to Black women's perception of motherhood and breastfeeding.  The influence of culture, and socio-economic factors, as well as family and community members often leads to significant stress for Black women, some of whom are often not able to adhere to the recommended infant feeding options. 
Our research will explore the infant feeding practices and experiences of HIV+ Black women living in Ottawa-Canada, Port Harcourt-Nigeria and Miami-USA during the first year of life. The project also seeks to empower Black women and their communities to be self-advocates in the fight against HIV. Using mixed-methods research informed by CBPR principles, we will explore the socio-cultural, gender and socio-economic factors influencing infant feeding. Understanding these issues will contribute to knowledge necessary for feasible and sustainable infant feeding guidelines for women living with HIV.
The results will have important implications for informing action for the development of effective services and policies on infant feeding in the context of vertical HIV transmission. This process of this study will contribute to the empowerment of Black women living with HIV to actively engage in actions to address the challenges associated with infant feeding.

This overrepresentation of ACB women is believed to be in part due to social and structural factors, such as HIV-related stigma, gender discrimination, and racial discrimination, which converge to increase vulnerability to HIV infection by reducing access to HIV prevention and care.  Given the disproportionate burden of HIV infection among ACB women, the development of HIV interventions to respond to these increased risks is vital.  The project builds on three recently completed CIHR- funded studies lead by the PI which include infant feeding practices of ACB women living with HIV, HIV vulnerability and resilience among ACB men and ACB HIV Monitoring and Surveillance. They highlight the need for critical health and racial literacy among providers and community members. Critical health and racial literacy interventions are increasingly being used to promote health especially in the current context of COVID-19 and co-morbidities like HIV.   Peer-led programs can be an effective strategy for reaching at-risk populations. Scholars further recognize that ACB communities need to be involved in interventions addressing health inequities.  

This study seeks to create, implement, and evaluate an ACB community-based peer-led intervention to improve access to HIV prevention and care for ACB women in Ontario. Community-based participatory research (CBPR), guided by intersectionality lens, implementation science and evaluation frameworks will be used to guide the project.  The project consists of 5 phases over a 5-year period and builds on a record of inspired and innovative HIV-related work in ACB communities led by ACB women scholars.  Evidence on the effectiveness of this innovative, peer-led intervention can be used to inform policies and practice related to HIV prevention and care for ACB women in Canada."

Despite how common and costly it is, surprisingly little is known about pneumonia, especially regarding patients treated outside of the hospital.  Furthermore, many people suspect that an episode of pneumonia might signal poor health and long term problems with illness and repeat episodes of pneumonia.

Therefore, we created a cohort of 7000 patients with pneumonia treated between 2000 and 2002 in Alberta.  We collected detailed information on all of these patients, including how sick they were, how much oxygen they needed, and how bad their pneumonia was - information not routinely available in regular administrative databases.  We now propose following those patients for 5 years in a virtual fashion - by finding out what happened to them using provincial databases that record morbidity and mortality rates.  Using advanced analytic techniques we will describe rates (and predictors) of death, repeat pneumonia, and hospitalizations over 5 years; explore the role of how strong and mobile someone is and how they do after pneumonia (their functional status); and figure out how important it is to have ""enough"" oxygen before going home with a bad pneumonia.

Our study will be the largest and longest study of pneumonia patients that has ever been put together.  The results will help doctors figure out who needs more attention after they go home with pneumonia and who is better off coming in to the hospital and most important help patients and policy-makers figure out who might need more help and attention down the road because they are at high risk of getting pneumonia again or even unnecessarily dying."

Finally, individual stories will further help us understand how COVID-19 has affected chronic disease care among FN peoples.

Our novel study with FN people is urgent. This work will allow front-line health directors and leaders within FN communities to understand how COVID-19 is influencing their communities and people and will assist in service planning post-pandemic. 

Our existing partnerships with the FN communities will enable the co-creation of materials, use of the data to inform the current and future public health response, and deepen the understanding of how care was affected during the pandemic. We will build awareness and share results together."

Ongoing social, racial and systemic inequities due to colonialism have compounded with government and public health measures in response to COVID-19. While there are effective vaccines to prevent and lower COVID-19 infections, Indigenous peoples have a long and painful history with disease outbreaks, with western medicine and healthcare, including vaccines. To date, we do not know how Indigenous peoples are accepting COVID-19 vaccines and the pandemic's influence on other routine immunizations.

Using the existing Community Health Immunization Program (CHIP) and Alberta Health data, we will work with First Nations communities to report COVID-19 and other immunization data for First Nations and Urban Indigenous peoples in Alberta. This includes real-time COVID-19 immunization rates, as well as other routine immunization patterns for adults and children before, during and after COVID-19 waves. Also, we will document any cultural-specific practices used to promote COVID-19 vaccination, to be shared and used to shape future immunization programming for First Nations and Urban Indigenous communities.

Our study examining COVID-19 and other immunizations in First Nations people is timely and important. This work will allow First Nations communities to better understand COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and how COVID-19 is influencing routine immunization programs. Taken together, this work will assist in COVID-19 response and immunization program planning post-pandemic for Indigenous people across Canada.

Our strong partnerships with First Nations communities and use of existing data platform (CHIP) will enable the co-design, co-creation of materials, and use of the findings to inform current and future immunization program planning. We will build awareness and share results together."
A Characterization of Children's Lunches at School in Urban and Rural Locations in Saskatchewan,"['Everitt, Tracy']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,383051,"Background:
Recent research shows that the diet quality of Canadian children during school hours is poor. There is significant international evidence for the higher nutritional quality of food in school meal program lunches compared to lunches brought from home, yet very little research on school food has been conducted in the Canadian context.

Objectives:
To characterize the school lunches and snacks of elementary school children in Saskatoon and the surrounding rural areas.

Methods:
Data collection involved characterizing lunches in schools that have a meal program, those that do not have a meal program and rural schools, using a school food checklist and digital photographs. The School Food Checklist was informed by checklists used in other studies which were found to be an efficient and accurate method of obtaining dietary information in schools. 

Results: 
 Our final sample size includes the lunches of 741 children in the three locations. Our preliminary results show that meal program participants have more whole grains in their lunches compared to children who bring food from home and that students not in meal programs have significantly more calories in their lunches from unhealthy foods. Final results include a comparison of the overall nutrient density of foods brought to school in the two geographic locations and served in meal programs.

Conclusions:
Overall food provided in meal programs appears to be more nutritious than food brought from home. Elementary school children benefit from meal programs.  

Describe how this research demonstrates innovation: 
This is the largest known study to date in Canada characterizing what elementary school children are eating at school in rural and urban contexts. 

Describe how this research informs change to future public health research, policy development and/or practice:    
This research will be used to inform school nutrition policy and research examining the impacts of a universal school lunch program."
New Canadian Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines for the Early Years (aged 0-4 years),"['Exercise Physiology, CANADIAN S', 'Duggan, Mary']",['N/A'],"['Guidelines', 'Physical Activty', 'Sedentary Behaviour']",1500.0,263652,"The Canadian Society for Exercise Physiology (CSEP) will present an update for community health professionals and the general public on Canada's first-ever evidence-based Physical Activity, and Sedentary Behaviour Guidelines for the Early Years (aged 0-4 years). There has been keen interest in guidelines for this age group for many years and now that the Guidelines have been published, questions are posed about what the recommendations are, how they impact the health of young children, and how parents and caregivers can implement the guidelins. We have four great presenters lined up - because physical activity and sedentary behaviour, although related, are separate and distinct scientific areas of focus and attendees will find out why!  Dr. Mark Tremblay, Director of the HALO Research Group and chair of the Guidelines Research and Development Committee will provide a brief overview on how the Canadian evidence-based guidelines were developed using internationally recognized standards.  Dr. Brian Timmons is the Research Director of the Child Health & Exercise Medicine Program at McMaster University and the scientific expert in Canada concerning physical activity for this age group.   Dr. Ian Janssen is the CRC Research Chair in Physical Activity and Obesity at Queen's University and his research examines the role that physical inactivity and obesity play in the development of poor health in both child and adult populations.  Allana LeBlanc (PhD candidate), Population Health, University of Ottawa will translate the guidelines to clear messages for health professionals, parents and caregivers. Children's health is of high importance to health professionals, parents and caregivers and a healthy lifestyle begins with healthy behaviours in the early years.  The CSEP's new guidelines for the Early Years provide the guidance and evidence-based recommendations that health professionals, parents and caregivers have been seeking."
Evaluation of a program to prevent adolescent health risk behaviours and promote positive mental health: The role of neurocognition,"['Exner-Cortens, Deinera M']",['N/A'],"['Adolescent Risk Behaviours', 'Developmental Neuroscience', 'Differential Responsiveness', 'Executive Functioning', 'Mental Health', 'Population Health', 'Prevention Science', 'Program Evaluation']",90000.0,301076,"Introduction. Adolescent risk behaviours, such as violence and substance use, are prevalent public health concerns in Canada. Further, these behaviours often co-occur, and are associated with poor mental health. Although a number of prevention programs exist that target these behaviours, few program evaluations have systematically investigated for whom and through what mechanism these programs work, information that is critical when resources are scarce and intervention needs are high. One characteristic that is important to consider when examining responsiveness to program is executive functioning (EF), or the mental processes involved in reasoning, planning, problem-solving and self-control. Deficits in EF are linked to engagement in adolescent risk behaviours, and because of cognitive changes that occur during this period, adolescence is an optimal time to intervene and promote EF. Objective. This study will examine if EF deficits are related to response to the Healthy Relationships Plus Program (HRPP), a skills-based program designed to reduce risk behaviours (violence, substance use) and increase mental well-being in adolescents aged 14-16. This study will also examine if changes in EF mediate the relationship between HRPP participation and program outcomes. Design and Participants. Participants for this study will be students aged 14-16 enrolled in an outcome evaluation of the HRPP (N=200). Data on EF will be collected from these students using lab-based measures at baseline, post-test and 6-month follow-up. Significance of Study. The findings from this study will contribute to understanding of how neurocognition is involved in response to universal public health programs, an area of growing focus with important implications for the health and well-being of Canadian youth. Findings from this study will also inform the creation of evidence-based adaptations of the HRPP, with the goal of improving outcomes for higher-risk adolescents."

It is also the main cause of death among people living with HIV. Nigeria, which is Africa's most populous nation with an estimated 197 million people, has the highest burden of TB, multi-drug resistant TB, and TB/HIV co-infection in the continent, and the sixth highest burden of TB globally. According to the World Health Organization's recent report on the 'End TB Strategy', ""the Sustainable Development Goals and the End TB Strategy targets set for 2030 cannot be met without intensified research and development"". Without question, research to address this health challenge will require international collaborative efforts; and will need to happen in settings with the greatest burden of TB disease. Clearly, there is a need for a meeting to share knowledge and discuss gaps and opportunities for further research in a setting like Nigeria with such enormous TB problems.

The objective of this proposal is to plan a meeting between Canadian investigators and multi-stakeholder teams (including researchers) from Nigeria to exchange knowledge on TB disease and co-develop priority and emerging research questions, that could form the basis of a future grant application to CIHR. If funded, we are poised to hold a series of face-to-face meetings in Nigeria, the epicentre of the TB epidemic in Africa. These meetings will represent a significant step in our efforts to facilitate knowledge transfer, co-develop and identify pressing research questions on TB; initiate new research collaborations; and move towards the development of a CIHR grant application to plan future research.

Ultimately, an effort like this could evolve in the long-term into a research program that will place Canada and Nigeria at the cutting-edge of TB research internationally, by potentially demonstrating new approaches and strategies to address complex epidemics."

These communities have more immigrants, refugees, and temporary foreign workers (together called 'newcomers') who often work in frontline essential jobs and have lower COVID-19 vaccination rates. This increases the risk for more COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths - especially as the more infectious COVID-19 Delta variant spreads. Research shows that newcomers face many barriers to vaccination, are more vaccine-hesitant, and have more difficulty getting COVID-19 related information from trustworthy sources. 

Alberta currently has the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates and highest COVID-19 infection rate in Canada, increasing the risk to unvaccinated newcomers. To improve vaccination rates among newcomers, our team members developed different outreach vaccination strategies including 1) onsite meat plant vaccine clinics for workers; and, 2) targeted community-engaged vaccination clinics (i.e., mass, pop-up and mobile bus clinics).

We will build directly on our already established COVID-19 research team and benefit from the goodwill and trust built by our community-partnered team to study how different vaccine outreach strategies for newcomers may help build vaccine trust and overcome vaccine hesitancy. We will study: 1) How COVID-19 vaccine outreach clinics may help overcome vaccine hesitancy; and, 2) Reasons for vaccine acceptance and hesitancy among unvaccinated newcomers. 

Our embedded mixed-methods case study will collect and study surveys and interviews with vaccinated and unvaccinated newcomers. We will then combine our data and use them to make recommendations to improve newcomer vaccination outreach programs. With COVID-19 vaccinations for children under 12 years expected soon, understanding the best vaccination strategies for vulnerable communities will help Canada and other countries improve vaccine delivery, protect vulnerable communities from COVID-19."

In an effort to protect the remaining caribou, a ban on caribou hunting was instituted in 2010 which had a myriad of consequences beyond its well-intentioned goal of protecting the species. The Tlicho people, who have long depended on the caribou as a primary and culturally-significant food source, have been deeply impacted by this shift. This project seeks to characterize the impact that the loss of caribou has had on Tlicho food security, mental wellness, and community resiliency in the face of major climatic and legislative changes. Within the community-based research framework, a combination of conversational qualitative methods and other indigenous research paradigms will be employed throughout the course of this work, and guidance from Tlicho Elders will be sought at all phases of research, from initial conception, through to execution and eventual data dissemination. We anticipate that this work will build capacity among Tlicho youth and scholars, and will form the foundation for future evidence-based policy recommendations."

The health and economic impacts of infant Group B Streptococcal (GBS) disease,"['Fakhraei, Romina']",['N/A'],"['Group B Streptococcal Disease', 'Health Administrative Data', 'Immunization', 'Intrapartum Antibiotic Prophylaxis', 'Maternal Vaccination', 'Perinatal Epidemiology', 'Vaccine']",105000.0,458923,"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) disease, a bacterial infection often harmless in healthy adults, is the leading cause of serious blood and brain infections in newborns. Globally, around 18% of pregnant women carry the GBS bacteria in their genital and urinary tract which they can transmit to their baby during birth. Even with improvements in treatments, many infants with GBS disease die from infection and survivors often suffer long-term health consequences such as deafness, mental function delays or paralysis. Nearly 75% of GBS disease in newborns happens in the first week of life, known as ""early-onset disease"". To help limit early-onset GBS disease, pregnant women are tested for GBS bacteria when they are 35-37 weeks pregnant. Those who test positive, receive antibiotics during labour. Those who go into labour prematurely and do not have the opportunity to receive testing also receive antibiotics. The current strategy helps to reduce early cases of GBS disease, but it still misses some cases and fails to prevent disease in older babies who become infected later. Antibiotics may harm the mother and infant by damaging beneficial bacteria and can cause a reaction among mothers who are allergic. Vaccinating mothers with a GBS vaccine during pregnancy may be a potential solution to prevent GBS in their babies. To help Canadians make decisions about whether a vaccine will be better at preventing GBS and reducing healthcare costs, we need to have more information on the health burden of infant GBS and the effectiveness of current Canadian screening and treatment strategies. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap by reporting on the health consequences and total costs related to infant GBS disease, while also comparing current and future prevention strategies in terms of effectiveness and costs. Our results will give insight into the potential benefit of GBS vaccination during pregnancy, which will be useful for informing and supporting future vaccine recommendations."
Developing and evaluating an STI/HIV risk assessment intervention tool: implications for scaling up,"['Falasinnu, Titilola']",['N/A'],"['Clinical Prediction Models', 'Online Health Services', 'Predictive Algorithm', 'Risk Assessment', 'Risk Scoring', 'Selective Screening Criteria', 'Sexual Behavior', 'Sti/Hiv']",105000.0,245922,"In British Columbia, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are distributed unequally across the population, with youth (15- 24 years of age) bearing a significant burden of infection. Undiagnosed and untreated infections often lead to serious reproductive sequelae and/or opportunistic co-infections (e.g., HIV). Interventions involving active case finding and early treatment of infections are priorities for public health efforts. One population-level intervention provided by the BC Centers for Disease Control (BCCDC) is Internet-based testing or iTest, which aims to improve STI/HIV testing amongst youth and other groups that experience high rates of STI/HIV. When users access iTest, the website recommends tests based on a risk score for STI/HIV risk and then provides appropriate laboratory requisitions. The purpose of the proposed research is to develop, refine, test and validate a practical risk-scoring (or prediction) tool to support the continuum of potential uptake or scale-up of iTest. This risk-scoring tool will be comprised of a set of selective screening criteria which will be valuable for minimizing costs, targeting testing to higher risk individuals, increasing the probability of detecting infection among asymptomatic men and women, and reducing the unnecessary testing of those without infection. The proposed study aims to: (1) Develop the STI risk-scoring tool that will be used in iTest; (2) Assess the capacity of the risk- scoring tool to adequately discriminate between those who are infected and those who are not; and (3) Determine the utility of the risk-scoring tool and iTest's 'fit' for province-wide scaling up. Using multivariable analysis, the risk-scoring tool will be developed from data collected at the largest publicly funded sexual health clinic in Vancouver between 2001 and 2010 (n=76,000). The validity or usefulness of the risk-scoring tool will be evaluated in two additional clinical settings in Vancouver."
"Cross-sectional relationships of physical activity, sleep quality, and cognitive function in older adults","['Falck, Ryan S']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,382999,"The growing public health problem of cognitive impairment-and the fact a pharmaceutical cure does not yet exist-places increasing need for lifestyle and behavioural approaches that maintain cognitive health. Current evidence suggests physical activity and sleep quality are important for cognitive health. Research also suggests physical activity and sleep quality may be related to each other. Since physical activity and sleep quality may be associated with each other and with cognitive function, investigating the relationships PA and sleep quality have with cognitive function should not be performed in isolation. For example, it is plausible physical activity does not independently predict cognitive function, but influences cognition through sleep (or vice-versa). We therefore examined whether 1) physical activity is associated with better cognitive performance independent of sleep quality; 2) sleep quality is associated with better cognitive performance independent of physical activity; and 3) physical activity is associated with sleep quality. Our findings suggest that both physical activity and sleep quality are associated with cognitive performance. However, since we did not find any relationships between physical activity and sleep quality, we suggest that physical activity and sleep quality may help preserve cognitive function through independent mechanisms."

I propose a CDA of: scholarly texts (e.g.: scientific journal articles), media texts (e.g.: advertisement), and texts from interviews with bariatric surgeons. To determine the effects of discourses present within these texts, I will conduct interviews with over weight youth. A search of databases will be done to locate articles on youth weight loss surgery and the analysis will map the scientific discourses on this issue and its intersection with other bodily (e.g., discourses of obesity) and social discourses (e.g., discourses of gender). Interviews with bariatric surgeons will explore their perceptions and experiences with youth weight loss surgery as well as how they promote their services in the media. A Google text and image search will be conducted to map the textual and visual representations of youth weight loss surgery in digital media as well as the discourses they re-articulate. Interviews with overweight youth

Initial results show that trans people experience high rates of violence and trauma.  With oversight from an Advisory Committee of Trans PULSE community investigators, select data will be analyzed to determine how these types of violence/trauma are related to the emotional well-being of trans people, their experiences of social exclusion and HIV risk, as well as to document disparities with non-trans people.  This analysis will assist in developing a greater understanding of how different forms of harassment and violence affect trans people, so that we can begin to create prevention models for HIV and other health-related factors, that are firmly grounded in the social determinants of health, thereby contextualizing community and individual issues.  Understanding how violence impacts the lives of Ontario trans people will also provide data for advocating for funding of services, and as evidence-based research for policy makers concerned with (for example) human rights legislation. With these data, community members will have the opportunity to participate in both traditional routes of dissemination, such as journal articles and conference presentations, as well as alternate modes of mobilizing knowledge, including e-bulletins, web-based initiatives, community-led forums and a future Trans PULSE Policy Institute."

The root causes of our health, also named social determinants of health, comprise a variety of elements that are interconnected, such as our working conditions, education, housing conditions, food security or social exclusion and discrimination. Considering their impact on our well-being, the World Health Organization has invited healthcare professionals, such as physicians, nurses, and dentists, to expand the scope of their interventions and address these social factors, for instance through advocacy. 
Healthcare professionals, however, lack the necessary training to adopt such social approaches since their education is mainly focused on treating diseases and learning technical skills. Indeed, they are generally reluctant to adopt social approaches and struggle to address the fundamental causes of people's health. 
Very recently, though, we have observed important changes among Canadian health professionals of Iranian descent. Following the Woman-Life-Freedom movement - a civil unrest that unfolded in Iran in 2022 after the murder of Mahsa Jina Amini, a 22-year-old woman in police custody- many protestors in Iran were injured. As a response, Canadian healthcare professionals of Iranian descent have started advocating for justice in the face of violence and discrimination.
These events are a unique opportunity to understand how these professionals have been able to change their perspectives during the Woman-Life-Freedom movement and how these experiences have impacted their practice in Canada and their services to their Canadian clientele.
To attain these objectives, I will conduct a series of individual interviews with Iranian Canadian healthcare professionals who have been active during the Woman-Life-Freedom movement. I will analyze these interviews with the hope that my findings will help other clinicians in Canada address the root causes of people's health."

In collaboration with ParticipACTION, a national, not for profit, social marketing organization promoting physical activity and sport participation, my research programme will develop and implement a high quality program of population health intervention research for the ongoing monitoring and evaluation of Active Canada 20/20. The programme will consist of a series of interlinked and ongoing studies looking at dissemination of the strategy, its uptake by policymakers and practitioners, and case studies of a range of physical activity initiatives across Canada. Knowledge exchange with practitioners, researchers and decision makers is integrated within the research programme as are extensive opportunities for mentoring a new generation of scientists who will become leaders in physical activity and applied public health in Canada.  My research will contribute new knowledge internationally in understanding the role of national strategies in promoting health behaviours, and how such strategies can be effectively implemented. Specifically, it will contribute to understanding of the potential of microgrants in enhancing community capacity to provide opportunities for physical activity, mass events in promoting physical activity, and provide exciting opportunities to assess the impact of future policy and programme decisions in creating the conditions conducive for Canadians to be more physically active."

However, evidence confirms that the number of children walking to/from school has declined over the last twenty years. Project BEAT was a large-scale, mixed methods, multidisciplinary research programme that was developed to explore why this has occurred with a particular emphasis on how the built environment may shape decisions regarding travel mode. Since project BEAT started, an intervention to encourage active school travel has been promoted across Canada - School Travel Planning. This approach emphasises the development of school specific plans to address barriers to active school transport. These two initiatives(BEAT and STP) have the common objective of increasing active school travel, an objective that stands to benefit significantly from recent research evidence (BEAT) informing practice (STP).  Therefore, the purpose of this dissemination event is to ensure that lessons from BEAT are integrated into the school travel planning model being implemented nationally. Key lessons include 1) the need to consider how school travel is different for girls and boys; 2) that the built environment around the home may be more influential than that around the school; and 3) that walking increases in the after school period. We propose a workshop with identified knowledge users including local practice and policy partners (public health, police, municipal planners & traffic engineers, school boards, parents & school administrators) involved in STP planning across Canada.  Working with knowledge users we will share BEAT findings, identify solutions, and modify the STP process to optimize its potential impact on AST in Canada."

Irrespective of weight outcomes, physical activity is independently associated with better physical and mental health.  The focus of the proposed research programme is to identify the factors that influence physical activity. This information is important in
developing effective interventions designed to increase physical activity which in turn can be integrated into broader weight
management interventions. We will examine how objectively measured physical activity is related to factors such as confidence, and social support in this population. This will identify those factors that appear most important as potential targets to change during an intervention. Overall, this timely and innovative research programme will provide insight into the relationship between physical activity and health in this underserved population, and provide the basis for the development of theoretically informed interventions to increase physical activity."
Exercise and Depression: Moving from Efficacy to Effectiveness,"['Faulkner, Guy']",['N/A'],"['Depression', 'Exercise', 'Intervention', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Mhealth', 'Physical Activity']",533768.0,354260,"Physical inactivity is a health risk factor and a burden on Canadian public health. While inactivity is of concern at a population level, it is even more troubling for individuals with mental illness such as depression.  At least 1.4 million Canadians (7% of women and 5% of men) suffer from depressive symptoms at any given point in time and one in seven will experience depression during their lifetime. Conventional depression treatments (e.g., psychotherapy & medications) are expensive and have limited appeal, reach and accessibility for many individuals with depression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the development of innovative and acceptable treatment options that can ultimately reach all Canadians with depressive symptoms. One of the most effective non-pharmacological interventions for mental illness is engagement in exercise. As a timely response to new clinical guidelines and national mental health strategies, the proposed research program will be unique internationally in developing, assessing, and evaluating exercise interventions and initiatives aimed at alleviating depression across the lifespan. Three primary inter-related projects will develop an exercise intervention tool-kit for use by mental health practitioners in collaboration with their patients, and test several novel approaches to delivering exercise interventions to individuals with depression including referral to structured and supervised exercise and the development of a mobile app-based intervention to increase physical activity in adults with depression.  My research will provide a blueprint to individuals and healthcare providers for innovative, sustainable, and feasible physical activity strategies that can reduce the burden of depression."
Characterising the effect of PM2.5 air pollution exposure on tuberculosis (TB) treatment outcomes and TB-associated mortality in a high TB burden setting,"['Faust, Lena']",['N/A'],"['Epidemiology', 'Exposure Science', 'Fine Particulate Air Pollution', 'Global Health', 'India', 'Tuberculosis']",105000.0,416933,"Tuberculosis (TB) is responsible for a greater number of deaths worldwide than any other single infectious disease. India shoulders a particularly high burden of TB, accounting for more than one quarter of global TB cases. Given the high levels of pollution in India's large cities, and the identification of air pollution as the most significant environmental cause of disease globally, India is a pertinent setting in which to investigate the association between air pollution and TB outcomes. Although past studies have identified smoking as a risk factor for progression to active TB as well as TB-related mortality, none have explored the effects of exposure to fine particulate (PM2.5) air pollution on TB outcomes. This study therefore aims to characterise personal-level exposures to PM2.5 among TB patients in India, comparing exposure in active TB patients in the highly polluted city of New Delhi to those in the less polluted town of Udupi, Karnataka. Personal-level exposure will be measured using small, lightweight personal aerosol monitors. Patients will be followed up over a period of 2 months, and outcomes measured will include treatment response and TB-associated mortality. Adequate treatment response will be defined by the absence of detectable viable TB bacteria in patients' sputum (mucus) samples at 2 months of treatment. Appropriate statistical methods, including logistic regression analyses, will be carried out to determine whether an association is likely to exist between PM2.5 air pollution exposure and poorer TB treatment outcomes. Being the first to investigate the effect of individual-level PM2.5 exposure in TB patients on TB treatment outcomes, this study addresses two significant and coinciding health concerns in India and globally: TB and air pollution. By providing an evidence base for TB treatment considerations in this context, the findings of this study may therefore contribute to improved TB control and prevention."

Identifying Mechanisms for Facilitating Knowledge to Action Strategies on the Built Environment to Curb Obesity Epidemics,"['Fazli, Ghazal S']",['N/A'],"['Diabetes', 'Population Health', 'Population Interventions']",500.0,346569,"To consult stakeholders from a variety of sectors and disciplines across Southern Ontario (N=50) on knowledge gaps, challenges and key steps to implementing policy and planning changes related to the built environment to promote healthy and active living lifestyles and improve health outcomes. A stakeholder engagement meeting was held in Toronto to bring together a diverse group of stakeholders across multiple sectors and agencies and identify barriers, opportunities and solutions on policy and planning changes to the built environment. Based on stakeholder input, preliminary qualitative thematic analyses were conducted to identify emerging themes related to knowledge gaps and barriers that impede evidence-based decision-making and policy development related to the built environment. Relevant themes, key research priorities and next steps for influencing policy and planning changes to the built environment were identified and validated through post-meeting consultations with participating stakeholders. From the qualitative thematic analysis, five themes emerged including: targeted and Impactful Messaging, Common Measures and Tools, Tailored research for informed policymaking, Intersectoral collaboration and alignment within and between Levels  of Government, Importance of Public and Private Sector Advocacy; and two cross-cutting themes: Collective impact approach and Implementation mechanisms for optimal impact, were identified. Additional research and action items were also identified to guide the development of solution-oriented strategies around future research, planning, and policymaking in informing policy and planning changes to the built environment. Our results highlight the importance of identifying solution-focused mechanisms to align visions and strategies across multiple sectors and agencies in order to achieve changes to the built environment."

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using data from four consecutive cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey  from 2007 and 2008 to  2013 and 2014, including participants aged 20-74 in Southern Ontario. We used geographic information system tools to create neighbourhood level  park exposures based on size of parks (small or medium-0.5-4.9 hectares, large- greater than 5 hectares) and number of parks within 800m of participants' postal code of residence. Our cohort was comprised of 41,945 individuals, with both age groups being equally represented. Overall access to parks was also associated with greater levels of physical activity; however, effects were greatest among younger adults. In this age group, living closer to large-sized parks was strongly associated with physical activity, respectively. Similar associations were seen in those over age 50. Access to small or medium sized parks demonstrated lesser associations overall with physical activity, except in highly walkable areas. For instance, residents in highly walkable areas had substantially higher levels of physical activity than those in areas of low walkability, particularly in the presence of  greater than 1 small or medium park."

The greatest burden of diabetes is among racialized populations and those of lower socioeconomic status. Prior research suggests that intervening early in the natural course of diabetes development can help to delay or prevent its onset. However, to date, there is little evidence on interventions and solutions that target these critical windows and can be implemented in healthcare and community settings to prevent or delay future development of diabetes. 

Furthermore, while patient engagement in health research is gaining prominence, research priorities and interventions for diabetes prevention are rarely designed by the populations in which they are intended to serve. Thus, there is a critical need for research that is carried out 'with' or 'by' those with lived experiences to inform equity-driven research and policy priorities. 

This planning grant will support engaging with patient partners and community members who are representative members from racialized and marginalized communities as well as clinicians, researchers, policymakers, and knowledge users to identify key research priorities for diabetes prevention and co-develop recommendations for potential policies and programs to reduce the risk of diabetes. Informed by a scoping review of the available evidence and a concept mapping exercise, the planning meeting will be organized to exchange perspectives, knowledge, and experiences to co-develop and plan for research and priorities and policy actions for diabetes prevention in health and community settings.

In Canada, one in three individuals has prediabetes or diabetes, and these conditions disproportionately impact racialized and lower socioeconomic populations. Diabetes can be prevented or delayed through targeted health behavioural interventions promoting physical activity and weight loss. Healthy urban designs have the potential to shift population health behaviours on a broad scale. For example, living in neighbourhoods that promote physical activity (i.e., walking, cycling, public transit use) is associated with lower rates of obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and mortality, compared to areas that are more car-dependent. As well living in close proximity to parks and greenspace has been linked with significant mental and physical health benefits. However, the effects of neighbourhood features such as walkability and greenspace on stages of diabetes development are unknown. Our team will use population health and environmental data to study the effects of neighbourhood walkability and greenspace policies on the progression to/reversion from different phases of diabetes development and whether these relationships vary by population characteristics such as age group (younger and older adults), gender (men and women), socioeconomic status, immigration status, and world region of origin. This research will also identify policies targeting walkability and greenspace (alone or combined) that are most beneficial for diabetes prevention; for whom these interventions are beneficial, under what context and how early in the course of diabetes development these benefits occur. These findings will be translated into real-world policy solutions. To achieve this, we will engage with local leaders from planning and transportation and public health to identify potential policy solutions that will make Canadian cities healthy, green, and climate resilient and prevent diabetes."
Supporting nutrition and physical activity in adolescent girls - A systems analysis,"['Feicht, Rebecca']",['N/A'],"['Gender', 'Health Promotion', 'Nutrition', 'Physical Activity', 'Youth']",105000.0,327806,"There is a current public health focus on childhood obesity, with nutrition and physical activity (PA) as associated behaviours. Canadian youth do not meet nutritional guides, and are insufficiently active, a problem especially evident in girls, who tend to become less active with age. While comprehensive interventions are known to be most effective, it is common for initiatives to target only one behaviour, such as PA, rather than both PA and nutrition. As Nova Scotia currently has a comprehensive provincial strategy to support obesity prevention, there appears to be a disconnect between policy and practice. This study will explore this disconnect, to determine what is being or could be done to support comprehensive interventions for adolescent girls' health. 

The study will focus on both PA and nutrition in older girls (aged 16-19 years), using the social ecological model (SEM), which recognizes that environmental influences across multiple levels may help or hinder the ability of individuals to engage in healthy behaviours. Institutional ethnography, an approach that examines experiences of social relations and institutional processes will be used to examine processes influencing girls' PA and nutrition. The purpose of the study will be to explore the processes influencing implementation of interventions to support girls' PA and nutrition, and how those processes are influenced by institutional, social, and political relations. Data collection will involve observation of existing interventions in local schools and communities, document review of policies and procedures, and interviews with participants and key stakeholders. Outcomes will demonstrate the processes that contribute to the health of adolescent girls through nutrition and PA interventions. This systems level analysis will indicate where, how, and what is being done, and make recommendations for multi-level changes to support the health of young girls in research, policy, and practice."

However, even in countries where pertussis vaccination is recommended and provided for free, not all pregnant women become vaccinated possibly due to ongoing concern about the benefits and safety of vaccination during pregnancy for their children. As there is limited information on possible benefits or concerns of pertussis vaccination during pregnancy on longer-term health, our study will examine important health outcomes among children up to six years of age.

It has many serious physical, mental, and social health outcomes, such as depression, disordered eating patterns, and avoidance of physical activity. Indeed, such negative outcomes can lead to further weight gain. In Canada, one in four children has overweight or obesity. These children face weight bias in all aspects of their lives, including at school, where weight is the most common cause of bullying. Research on ways to reduce weight bias in children is scarce. However, one promising strategy is to address weight bias in school policies and curricula. This strategy is timely given the recent focus on creating safe and caring learning environments in schools.

Partnering with the Edmonton, Alberta school community, I will lead a study to develop, implement, and assess the impact of a tailored, school-based program in reducing weight bias in Grades 1-3 students, school staff, and parents. Proposed program elements include student, school staff, and parent education and anti-weight bias policy. I will develop resources, such as lesson plans, for the program, which will be implemented for eight months in an elementary school. To assess program impact, I will examine weight bias in students, school staff, and parents before and after the program implementation period. I will also explore school staff experiences in delivering the program, in order to improve its content and design.

This research is needed to create effective strategies to reduce weight bias in schools, a public health issue affecting many Canadian children. By presenting findings to key stakeholders (e.g., Alberta Education), I hope to influence policy change to address weight bias in schools and foster positive social environments that promote children's health and well-being. This program has the potential to be scaled up for students in Grades K-12 across Canada."
Suicide attempts across multiple social identities among gay and bisexual men: An Intersectionality Analysis,"['Ferlatte, Olivier']",['N/A'],"['Gay And Bisexual Men', 'Intersectionality', 'Quantitative Methods', 'Suicide']",1500.0,324449,"Several studies have demonstrated that gay and bisexual men are at increased risk of suicidal behaviors but less attention has been given to within group differences among this population. In this paper, we investigate how prevalence of recent suicide attempts varies among gay and bisexual men, across multiple axes of social identity, such as class, age, ethnicity, education, partnerships and geography. 

We used data from a national survey of Canadian gay and bisexual men. We first measured the individual effects of each socio-demographic variable. The second stage was informed by intersectionality and tested for interaction between the demographic variables.

When looking for the individual effects, only two variables were associated with suicide attempts in the last 12 months: not having achieved a university degree and lower income. However, several two-way interaction terms were statistically significant. First, we found that education and income interacted significantly with one another, such that the odds of recent suicide attempts for those with no university degree was 1.74 times higher among those with higher income but 5.51 times higher among those with lower income. Second, we found that sexual orientation and partnership status interacted with one another; among bisexual men those in heterosexual partnerships were at decreased odds of reporting a recent suicide attempt in comparison to those who were single or in relationship with a man, while this effect was not significant among gay men.  Finally, we found that both income and education interacted with geography; the effects of these variables were significant among urban men but not among men living suburban and rural settings. 

Our exploration of recent suicide attempts among gay and bisexual suggests that members of this community are not affected by suicide equally. Future research and suicide prevention interventions must acknowledge the diversity of experiences among gay and bisexual men."

How Independent Mobility Influences Outdoor Active Play among 8-11 year old children.,"['Ferrao, Thomas']",['N/A'],['Isc Travel Awards'],1000.0,324332,"Objective
Active play refers to unstructured and self-directed physical activity performed in children's free time. Active play can contribute to greater physical activity levels and subsequently help prevent obesity. The extent to which parents influence the active play domain of physical activity is not well established. One way in which parents could negatively influence their child's active play is by limiting their independent mobility, or the extent to which they can travel around their neighbourhood without adult supervision. The objective of this study is to determine if independent mobility is associated with active play among 8-11 year olds.

Methods
Participants consist of dyads of 8-11 year old children and one of their parents/guardians. Participants are from across Canada and the United States. To measure active play, parents completed a web-based survey consisting of questions measuring how frequently their child engages in outdoor play in various locations. Independent mobility was measured by asking parents how far their child is allowed to roam from home alone and with friends without adult accompaniment. All survey questions were taken or adapted from existing validated instruments. Generalized linear models will be used to examine the relationship between the independent mobility and active play frequency of children, while controlling for several covariates.

Results
Data collection is ongoing. A sample size of 500 is targeted. Results will be presented at the conference. 

Discussion
This study aims to fill current gaps in the literature by examining how limiting a child's independent mobility restricts their outdoor active play."
Modeling the Influence of Chronic Illness and Family Environment on Self-concept and Mental Health Outcomes in Adolescents,"['Ferro, Mark']",['N/A'],"['Adolescent', 'Chronic Illness', 'Determinants Of Health', 'Family Environment', 'Growth Curve Modeling', 'Mental Health', 'Parental Depression', 'Population Health', 'Secondary Analysis', 'Self-Concept']",140000.0,247250,"About 50% of adults with mental disorders experienced their onset during adolescence. Among those at elevated risk for mental disorder are adolescents with chronic illnesses (AWCI), representing about 1 in 5 adolescents in Canada. In this vulnerable group, self-concept, our internal depiction of social acceptance, capabilities, worth, and physical appearance, may be an important mechanism linking the experience of a chronic illness with elevated risk for mental disorder. In healthy people, poor self-concept in adolescence is linked to depression, substance abuse, criminal behaviour, and lower education, while positive self-concept protects against declines in health. However, no studies have used national databases to study self-concept in AWCI and there is a lack of research demonstrating the influence of self-concept on future mental disorders in AWCI. My research program is designed to show that self-concept can be altered to reduce the risk of psychiatric disorder among AWCI. To achieve this, I will conduct a number of studies using the Canadian National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (1996-2009). The research questions include: 1) Are questionnaires developed to measure self-concept in healthy adolescents appropriate for AWCI? 2) Do AWCI have poorer self-concept compared to healthy adolescents? 3) What individual and family factors predict self-concept in adolescents with and without chronic illness and do predictors differ across gender? 4) How does the family environment impact self-concept and does self-concept predict mental health problems in adolescents with and without chronic illness? Given the number of AWCI in Canada, the burden on individuals, families, and society, and the lack of existing research, it is important to establish the leverage that self-concept might provide in protecting against mental disorders. I envision the results being used to develop interventions to improve self-concept and prevent onset of mental disorders in AWCI."

Our results showed that 25% to 40% of children living with a long-term physical illness, like asthma or epilepsy, also had a mental illness, like depression or anxiety. We call this multimorbidity. We found that a child's age, sex, and level of disability, the caregivers mental health and the family's income level were related to whether a child or youth would experience multimorbidity. Some research shows that some children and youth who have a long-term physical illness have good mental health, but we don't know what happens as children and youth get older and become young adults. Working with young people and family members with lived experience, our research goal is to understand the long-term mental health of children and youth who were part of the MY LIFE study and who are now aged 7 to 20 years. We will look at whose mental health improves over time, remains the same, and declines, and what things affect these changes. We will look at whether new patterns of multimorbidity start as children get older, what things about their lives are related to mental illness over time, and look at how their use of mental health services changes as they get older. We will also include the brothers and sisters of the children and youth participating in our study to allow us to make comparisons to children and youth who share the same family environment. We will link our data with health services data collected by the government as this gives us good quality information about service use. This study will create new knowledge needed to help support mental health in children and youth living with physical illness."

"Comprehensive intervention strategies with young HIV-positive women in Canada: individual, social, and cultural factors that make sexual health promotion programs successful.","['Fielden, Sarah J']",['N/A'],"['Adolescents', 'Evaluation', 'Family', 'Food Security', 'Gender', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Intervention Mapping', 'Prevention', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Sexual Health']",135000.0,177221,"Despite extensive global efforts to combat HIV/AIDS through prevention, treatment, and care services, HIV infection rates continue to rise and approximately 25% of new infections are among young people. Young women are especially vulnerable to infection due to developmental, biological, social, and cultural factors contributing to the feminization of the pandemic. Research that extends beyond behavioural models of sexual health promotion is urgently needed to help curb the spread of HIV and provide support and care for those already living with HIV/AIDS. This proposed research is Pan-Canadian and aims to both develop and evaluate innovative sexual health interventions with HIV-positive young women. Given evidence of the multiplicity of factors impacting on health and wellness outcomes for women living with HIV, the objectives of the study include examining social and community influences. As a qualitative program of research, this work will enhance the understanding of developing successful interventions with groups of marginalized young women through using qualitative and community-based methodologies. This will involve combining various qualitative methods including naturalistic observation and in-depth interviews with young women and other key stakeholders such as family members and service providers. It will use intervention mapping, a step-wise systematic method of determining relevant stakeholders, community needs, program directions, and evaluation. The proposed research explores and addresses support and service needs of young women living with HIV in various geographic and cultural communities as it relates to their sexual health. In addition to the development of theoretically and empirically-based interventions, the project will serve to illicit cultural knowledge including understandings about the daily experiences of these young women in relation to their medical institutions, community-based services, and family systems."

Previous studies have shown that these drugs improve the symptoms of BPH and decrease the need for surgery. However, the hormonal changes that result from their use may increase the chances of developing heart failure. The vast majority of the available data regarding the effects of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors on the heart are from clinical trials, a highly controlled setting that involves highly selected patients. To date, no high-quality studies have assessed this potential drug safety issue in patients seen in a real world setting. To address this important knowledge gap, we will examine this question in a clinical database from the United Kingdom called the Clinical Practice Research Datalink or CPRD. This database contains electronic medical records from over 675 general practitioner practices and has information on over 13 million patients. Information from this database will be linked to that from a database called Hospital Episode Statistics, which records hospitalizations, and a database from the Office of National Statistics, which records deaths. We will identify all patients with BPH recorded in the CPRD and classify them into those treated with 5-alpha reductase inhibitors, those treated with alpha-blockers, and those whose BPH is not treated with medications. We will then compare the number of men in each group who are hospitalized for heart failure, have a heart attack, a stroke, or die of heart-related causes. In doing so, we will be able to determine if this class of drugs increases the chances of having heart problems. This study will therefore provide policy makers, healthcare professionals, and patients with the information required to make informed decisions regarding the risks and benefits associated with the use of 5-alpha reductase inhibitors for the treatment of BPH."

It is sold under the trade name Champix.  Previous studies have shown that it is the most effective pill used to help people stop smoking.  However, there is now some evidence that varenicline may have harmful effects on people's hearts and that it might increase the chances of having a heart attack.  Government agencies like Health Canada and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are currently studying the safety of varenicline.  Unfortunately, available information about its safety is limited.  For this reason, more studies are needed to determine if varenicline causes heart problems in people who are trying to stop smoking.  The proposed study will examine the safety of varenicline using information from the General Practice Research Database, or GPRD.  The GPRD is a database that contains the medical records for more than 11 million people in the United Kingdom.  We will use the GPRD to identify two groups of patients: those who took varenicline and those who took bupropion.  We will then compare the number of people in each group that had a heart attack in the 3 months after they started taking the pill.  We will also check if varenicline increases the chances of dying or being hospitalized for a stroke, heart failure, or heart operations.  To perform these comparisons, we will use a new type of statistical analysis called high-dimensional propensity scores.  This study will take 2 years to complete.  If varenicline increases the chances of having heart problems, patients and doctors need to know about these potential side effects.  On the other hand, if varenicline is safe, they need to know so that it can be prescribed to help people stop smoking.  Either way, this study will have important clinical and public health implications."
Levothyroxine for the Treatment of Subclinical Hypothyroidism in Pregnancy: A Population-based Assessment,"['Filion, Kristian B']","['Arel, Roxane', 'Grandi, Sonia', 'Platt, Robert W', 'Yu, Oriana Hoi Yun']","['Cohort Study', 'Databases', 'Drug Safety', 'Levothyroxine', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Population Health', 'Pregnancy', 'Pregnancy Complications', 'Subclinical Hypothyroidism']",175950.0,371824,"In Canada, there are over 450,000 pregnancies each year, including 380,00 live births and 100,000 abortions. Due to the increased demands during pregnancy, hypothyroidism or low thyroid hormone levels, are the most common endocrine disorder. Subclinical hypothyroidism (SCH) occurs in 2% of pregnancies as a result of high levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone levels but thyroid hormone thyroxine levels are normal and symptoms of hypothyroidism (such as fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain, or depression) are either mild or absent. Levothyroxine is used to treat overt hypothyroidism based on previous studies supporting a higher risk of pregnancy complications (both for the mother and baby) in these women.  However, the benefit of levothyroxine for SCH in pregnant women is less clear.  Despite a lack of firm evidence, current recommendations suggest that women start treatment with levothyroxine at the time of SCH diagnosis. Thus, there is a need to determine the effectiveness and safety of levothyroxine in pregnant women with SCH.  

Our study will use a database from the United Kingdom called the Clinical Practice Research Datalink to answer this question. This database has the electronic medical records for over 14 million patients and includes a detailed pregnancy register. We will compare the chances of having a pregnancy complication between patients who use levothyroxine and those who do not use levothyroxine. The main outcomes that we will study include maternal and fetal complications, such as diabetes and hypertension during pregnancy, blood loss during delivery, maternal death, preterm birth, small birth weight, and fetal death. 

If we find that levothyroxine reduces the risk of pregnancy complications, our study will provide reassurance regarding the effectiveness of this drug in pregnancy. Given the increasing rates of SCH in pregnancy, this study will have important policy, clinical, and public health implications."

We don't know much about vaccination rates or the factors that influence them in youth with ASD. We have already received funding to answer the following questions in Nova Scotia (NS): 1) What percentage of youth with ASD are vaccinated? 2) What factors influence vaccination of youth with ASD?

In the proposed project, we will answer similar questions in Alberta (AB). We know that context plays a major role in vaccination uptake so it is important to consider whether our NS results generalize to other regions of Canada. We will use health databases to examine how often youth with ASD receive school-based vaccinations compared to their peers without ASD. We will also hold focus groups with caregivers of youth with ASD to explore factors that may influence vaccination of youth with ASD. We will compare vaccination rates and experiences in NS and AB, which will help us to develop strategies to support vaccination in youth with ASD at both local and national levels.

This research is important because:  1) People with ASD represent at least 1% of Canada's population, so low rates of vaccination in this group would expose them and others to increased risk of infectious disease 2) If we find that youth with ASD are under-vaccinated, our results would provide a roadmap for making necessary changes 3) It will help us to understand issues that affect an under-served group in Canada. People with ASD have a hard time accessing healthcare services throughout their lives, placing them at increased risk for a range of medical problems. Our healthcare system must begin to respond to the unique needs of this group.  Working to ensure access to vaccination is an important step in this direction."

MEND (Mind, Exercise, Nutrition... Do it!) is a social enterprise founded in 2004 in the United Kingdom (UK) that delivers community and family-based obesity prevention and weight management programs targeting children and their caregivers. MEND is currently operating in over 350 locations in the UK, US Australia, New Zealand and Denmark. 
Alberta will be the first province in Canada to pilot test MEND programs.  Under a 3-year initiative, with initial funding from the Ministry of Alberta Health and Wellness and delivered by Alberta Health Services, program materials for two of MEND UK's programs (MEND 2-4 and MEND 7-13) will be adapted to the Canadian context and then pilot tested in 8 sites across the 5 zones within Alberta Health Services.   
While the MEND system provides good quantitative data on the impact of each program on its participants, the success of the spread of MEND in Alberta depends not only on the details of the intervention, but also the strategy used for scaling-up, the resource team and the user organizations that will be implementing the program in various communities.  The objective of the proposed project is to collect baseline and 1 year into implementation data to assess the effectiveness of the scale-up and spread of MEND in Alberta.  The proposed project will identify the barriers and supports to spread of MEND in Alberta and provide essential information to decision makers in other provinces and territories on the critical success factors for the scale-up and spread of MEND elsewhere in Canada.

"Redefining Resilience: Urban Indigenous Family Preservation Models as Decolonial Resistance in Victoria, BC","['Finestone, Erika']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1522.0,383174,"The 2015 Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Commission's primary call to action was to reduce the number of Indigenous children in the child welfare system. Today, there are three times more Indigenous children in care than at the height of the residential school period. The ongoing systematic removal of Indigenous children from their families represents a direct state assault on Indigenous health and wellness by disrupting another generation's ties to land, culture, and community: all of which are key social determinants of health for Indigenous peoples. Though many studies show the negative consequences of child removal on Indigenous communities, there is surprisingly little critical research evaluating existing programs and strategies aimed at preventing child removal and preserving Indigenous families, especially in urban environments where over 50% of Indigenous families currently reside. As such, we still lack a clear understanding of how 'prevention', as a set of programs and everyday practices, relates to the capacity for Indigenous families to be well in the city. Over a year and a half of community-based ethnographic research in the city of Victoria BC, I have investigated Indigenous peoples' pathways towards family preservation-what I term 'everyday prevention'-within and outside of preventative service agencies. This research has been augmented by the development and delivery of an arts-based workshop entitled ""Honouring Family Resilience"" that offers at-risk Indigenous caregivers the opportunity to share stories of family strength rooted in ancestral teachings. My research contributes a much-needed analysis of the relationship between urban Indigenous kinship systems, preventative service delivery, and Indigenous wellness in settler cities."

This study will investigate the impact of impending policy interventions and regulations for medical POA use in the province of Ontario on POA-related harms and problems on a population level. Several problem and harm indicators available for impact monitoring will be used and measured, including population and street drug user surveys, treatment admission and overdose death data as well as qualitative indicators regarding access to pain care. Ontario is of particular interest for this study, since it features both one of the highest POA use levels in Canada, as well as features some of the best harm indicator data country-wide. In addition, a comparison of policy determinants of differential POA use levels and harms between Ontario and the provinces of British Columbia and Quebec - which both feature substantially lower POA use especially regarding potent POAS with highre risk for misuse and harms on a population level - will be undertaken. This study focuses on natural policy experiments with substantial potential implications for policy making in the sensitive and complex realm of the emerging public health problem of POA misuse and harms, which could not be empirically investigated by ordinary scientific designs or experiments."

Too much time spent in front of screens by preschoolers has been linked to adverse health and developmental outcomes in later childhood. However, digital media use by young children can also benefit cognitive and psychosocial outcomes under the right circumstances.  To inform harm-reduction interventions, a nuanced understanding of the impact of digital media on children is needed. As such, the present project considers digital media usage comprehensively by considering context (ex., viewing alone vs coviewing), function (ex., passive viewing vs video chatting), and content (ex., educational vs violent) in addition to the duration of usage. The main objective of this research is to examine how digital media use during the pandemic contributes to child health, and developmental outcomes at the time of school entry. More specifically, Aim 1 is to examine how child media use contributes to direct assessments of health (ex., BMI, physical activity), and physical (ex., motor skills), cognitive (i.e., language, memory) and psychosocial (i.e., emotional regulation) outcomes. Aim 2 is to estimate associations between media use and academic outcomes at school entry (i.e., grades, classroom engagement). Finally, Aim 3 addresses the extent to which child (i.e., sex, temperament) and family (i.e., SES, parenting stress) characteristics contribute to child digital media habits. The extent to which these characteristics amplify/buffer the consequences of child media use will also be considered. Aims will be met by assessing child health, physical, cognitive, psychosocial, and academic outcomes from a pre-existing sample of Canadian children (N=331, mean age= 6.46, in summer 2022) assessed twice previously during the pandemic in 2020 (mean age= 3.5) and 2021 (mean age=4.5).

Although there is currently no vaccine, several candidates are in clinical trial and are expected to soon become available. A variety of vaccination approaches are being considered and there is an urgent need to determine the optimal strategy. However, our current understanding of spatial and population variations in RSV transmission is lacking. Understanding these factors is imperative to accurately predict the impact of a new vaccine and identifying optimal delivery strategies that both maximize impact and reduce inequities. Routinely collected health data and cutting-edge analytical tools, which are commonly used to predict the impact of infectious disease prevention strategies, offer an efficient means of investigating these variations. This is particularly important, as comparison of these strategies in trial or field settings are not feasible or ethical. 

The goal of this project is to develop a rigorous simulation model that incorporates spatial variations in RSV transmission, including age-structure and population mixing. We will validate this model using routine health data to ensure our predictions accurately reflect the real-world. Next, we will investigate various proposed RSV vaccine strategies to identify which one(s) optimally reduce RSV burden across the entire population. Traditionally, these studies have characterized transmission dynamics and vaccine impact at aggregated levels. However, this ignores important local variability factors such as vaccine uptake and spatially structured contact networks. These variations can result in disparities in vaccine impact, as has been documented in recent measles outbreaks. Our research will enable a better understanding of RSV transmission mechanisms and can be used to inform the selection of optimal RSV vaccine strategies. Further, it will inform planning of current RSV prophylaxis programs and vaccine trials."

At writing, the incidence of C-19 in the First Nations and Inuit communities in roughly 20 times less than that of the province at large. Community mobilisation is an important yet understudied aspect of this remarkable success. This knowledge synthesis and translation project builds on preliminary work documenting the mobilization of community-level assets in defence of health. Using social media and other web sources, we have catalogued instances of community asset mobilization by the 55 indigenous communities in the province between March 1 and July 31, 2020.  A geo-referenced archive of all instances - over 1500 at present - is nearing completion. The aim of our proposed knowledge synthesis project is to engage representatives of each of the 10 First Nations and the Inuit communities of Quebec in a collaborative analysis of the data gathered. The analysis will focus on creating Knowledge Translation products and processes that can integrate into future epidemic and disaster planning efforts. This project will broaden the understanding of Indigenous community-level response to pandemic disease threat in several ways and contribute to: 1) optimizing disease containment strategies, 2) facilitating effective public health interventions, 3) recognizing and valuing citizen engagement, 4) deepening the understanding of community resilience and 5) mitigating the unintended effects of the COVID-19 response on other determinants of health."

Pilot tests demonstrated that it is capable of reaching youth who (based on their sexual and drug histories) may be at significant risk for HIV with an approach that they appreciate.
RESEARCH AIMS: (1) Understand the landscape, feasibility and readiness of communities across Canada to incorporate HIV prevention content into diverse Indigenous gatherings; (2) Build the research and health promotion capacities of 9 Indigenous SHC youth leaders and 3 trainees, as well as other youth in their communities; (3) Evaluate satisfaction and comfort level with SHC among youth participants; (4) Assess the intentions of youth at different Indigenous gatherings to: (a) engage in sexual practices; (b) use drugs and alcohol and (c) adopt harm reduction strategies; (5) Qualitatively understand community perceptions (e.g., youth, elders, adults) of the SHC and doing HIV outreach at Indigenous gatherings; (6) Disseminate a digital and print ""wise practice"" toolkit on doing culturally-safe peer lead HIV prevention outreach with Indigenous youth at communal gatherings.
METHODS: We will implement and evaluate the SHC at 9 Indigenous gatherings (3 First Nations, 3 Métis and 3 Inuit). A variety of methods will be used to gather data including: (A) Key Informant Interviews with local leaders; (B) iPad Surveys with youth at the gatherings and (C) a Speakers Corner where all can share their thoughts. 
SHARING RESULTS: We will disseminate a digital and print ""wise practice"" toolkit on doing culturally-safe peer HIV prevention outreach with Indigenous youth at communal gatherings. This project has the potential to reach ""high risk"" youth with information and resources to prevent the further spread of HIV and other STIs."

These anxiety disorders have also been associated with a higher risk of further cardiac events such as myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery disease. However, some contradictory results shed doubts on these conclusions. 

Considering the contradictory data and significant methodological issues found in the scientific literature, notably in terms of the validity of panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder diagnoses, new studies are essential to improve our understanding of this clinical problem as well as patient care.

In this context, this study aims to establish the prevalence of panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder in 3610 patients with coronary artery disease. Another objective is to document, over a period of 2 years, the impact of these anxiety disorder on the course of coronary artery disease, quality of life, psychological distress as well as adherence to treatments and risk-reducing lifestyle changes."

In the 21st Century, it is projected that one billion people may die of tobacco use, and the toll will be greatest in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In 2003, the 192 WHO countries adopted the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), the first-ever health treaty, which specifies a broad set of tobacco control policies that the FCTC Parties (now numbering 172 countries) must implement, e.g., enhanced warning labels, bans/restrictions on advertising/promotion, increased taxation, and smokefree laws. The International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project (ITC Project) is a Canada-led collaboration of leading tobacco control researchers across 22 countries (over 70% of the world's tobacco users) whose mission is to conduct rigorous evaluation of the impact of FCTC policies; it is the only international effort designed to evaluate the FCTC, that is, the only research program that focuses on whether the treaty is having its intended effects. The ITC Project uses state-of-the-art survey methods to answer key questions: Do graphic warnings lead to increased motivation to quit? Are smoke-free laws effective in reducing smoking in public places? Do higher taxes on cigarettes lead to shifts to other tobacco forms (e.g. bidis in Bangladesh) rather than to quitting? We will also examine how policy effects may vary across the 22 countries. The ITC Project has built an extensive research-to-action network in which we disseminate/transfer our findings rapidly in each country to key contacts in government, the research community, and Civil Society, which has led to significant policy changes in several countries, including Canada. The ITC Project has become an effective global system for generating, disseminating, and promoting the utilization of knowledge in the fight against the growing global tobacco epidemic, particularly in LMICs."

If fully implemented, the FCTC would be the greatest disease prevention initiative in history. But FCTC implementation has been slow, weakened by tobacco industry influence. The International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation (ITC) Project is a global research program addressing the urgent need for strong evidence about FCTC policy impact by (1) evaluating FCTC policies, (2) understanding determinants of tobacco use vs. quitting, (3) identifying differences in global FCTC policy impact. The ITC research team of >100 tobacco control experts has conducted cutting edge evaluation studies of FCTC policies in 22 countries, home to >70% of the world's tobacco users. ITC has consistently reported evidence used globally to strengthen tobacco policies that improve population health (www.itcproject.org). Since its start 13 years ago, ITC data have been used to strengthen tobacco control policies in many countries, including Canada. We propose to continue this global project by: 1) continuing our rigorous evaluation of FCTC policies, focusing on regions where the tobacco industry is increasing its attention (e.g., Asia, Africa, Middle East); 2) expand ITC to evaluate new leading-edge policies (e.g., plain packaging, additive bans), 3) conduct the first-ever international cohort study of e-cigarettes to answer critical questions about their impact on tobacco use; and 4) strengthen dissemination efforts to bring our evidence to governments to support stronger tobacco control globally. ITC has advanced science, improved population health initiatives, and built strong collaborations with governments and health communities globally.

Historically, the Indian Act and other oppressive acts of colonialism have submerged FN approaches. Opportunities to examine both FN health and euro-western approaches will cultivate culturally-rooted ways to guide FN health. A three-year community-based study using the tradition of storytelling with digital technology and oral history methods will create twenty digital stories of mite, along with heart and cardiovascular health care situated in FN women perspectives. The women will be from two communities; one urban (Winnipeg Manitoba) and one northern (Opaskwayak Cree Nation, Manitoba). We will create a safe space to discuss factors that negatively impact FN heart health such as transitions from traditional to westernized lifestyles and diets; poverty; poor access to quality foods; the legacy of residential schools; racism; access to medical care; culturally unsafe health care; and economic and geographic marginalization. The purpose of this study, governed by a two-eyed seeing approach, is to locate FN women's concepts, language, and experiences of mite (heart health), and initiate dialogues with euro-western medicine communities to extend our collective understanding of heart health among FN. By way of the deliverables personal videos, a website and curriculum materials, the study will encourage FN communities to engage in protecting their own heart health and support dialogue with euro-medicine communities.

A research program on adaptation to the health effects of climate change in the Canadian Arctic,"['Ford, James D']","['Edge, Victoria L']","['Adaptation', 'Arctic', 'Climate / Environment And Health', 'Climate Change', 'Community Based Research', 'Inuit', 'Nunavut']",753001.0,312773,"Climate change has been described as the biggest threat to human health this century. The Arctic is witnessing the most significant warming globally, and numerous health implications have been documented among Inuit communities. Focusing on adaptation offers a proactive approach for managing the health effects of climate change—one that views Inuit populations as active agents in planning and responding at household, community, and regional levels. Few studies, however, have examined opportunities for health adaptation at a community-level or evaluated how existing health policies and programs may affect vulnerability to future change. This has been identified by decision makers as an important research gap, and developing an evidence base on health adaptation needs to be a focus of future work.This research program explicitly addresses this need, with the overarching goal toidentify, evaluate, and prioritize potential policies, programs, and initiatives that can serve to reduce vulnerability and strengthen resilience to the effects of climate change of Inuit health.The work will focus on responding to multiple risks posed by climate change, covering food and water security, mental health, personal safety, and new and emerging diseases, and will feed into ongoing policy and programming around community based primary health care, emergency response, cultural promotion and preservation, health planning, and monitoring and surveillance. Building upon previous work, the program is structured around addressing key questions, including: What can households and communities do to protect themselves from climate change impacts? Are there existing community-level initiatives that can serve to reduce climate vulnerability? How can such initiatives be supported in the long term and could they promoted more broadly across northern communities to enhance resilience to climate change impacts? How will climate change affect demand for and utilization of public health services? Are public health units ready, and how can they become ready? What can regional and territorial governments do to adapt, and how can these be built into ongoing activities? What role can the federal government play? The development of an adaptation evaluation framework with our Northern partners, and integrating science and Inuit knowledge, underpins developing a rigorous and systematic evidence base for these questions, directly informing decision-making across scales.The program catalyzes a cross-cultural interdisciplinary team of researchers, community members, and decision makers, who have a long history of collaboration. The team have widely published, with their work informing policy development at multiple levels, and incorporates expertise in the health, social, and physical sciences, along with traditional knowledge holders. Leveraging co-funding and building upon completed CIHR work, the program has a central focus on training and mentorship, which will take place within a diverse Community of Practice. The creation of a student network, internship opportunities in partner organisations and universities, and visiting studentships, are all designed to promote program-wide mentorship. The program also has a strong emphasis on knowledge translation, which will be ongoing, and formalized through particular activities including: regular information nights in Northern communities, an Adaptation Summit, policy briefs for knowledge users, and multi-media activities."

The global response to the risks posed has been to focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This is imperative yet the science shows that we will not be able to avoid climate change, with the World Health Organization estimating that the direct health impacts alone will cost $2-4bn/yr by 2030 globally. For this reason, finding ways to adapt our health systems and behavior to reduce the risks of climate change is imperative, and is reflected in the increasing urgency with which governments at various levels in Canada and internationally are beginning to prioritize adaptation.
    Yet what can we do to adapt? How can we reduce the risks posed by climate change? What evidence is there on what will work? Unfortunately we have few answers to these questions, particularly for Indigenous populations including Canada's Inuit who are living in a region experiencing the most dramatic climate change anywhere. Indeed, the health community has long neglected climate change as a risk and is only beginning to recognize the magnitude of the problem. Canadian research is at the vanguard of such developments, and Dr Ford's team have spent over a decade working with Indigenous communities examining the risks posed by climate change to health and identifying risk factors. The program of research proposed here will take this to the next step, evaluating specific interventions for reducing the health impacts of climate change for 3 Indigenous populations: Inuit of Canada, Shipibo in the Amazon, and Batwa of Central Africa. The project builds upon ongoing research projects held by Dr Ford from the IDRC & tri-councils, has strong buy-in at multiple levels of health governance, and will work with decision maker partners to systematically and rigorous evaluate and prioritize potential health adaptations."

Many of these conditions have their origins in early life (conception, pregnancy, infancy and childhood) and a number of very good Canadian pregnancy and birth cohort studies have been implemented to explore hypotheses related to such Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD). However, there is general agreement that the research community could get more out of existing cohort resources. In addition, cohort investigators recognize that individual studies often do not have the statistical power, specific data items, or appropriate design needed to fully support the current and upcoming needs of cutting-edge research. For example, even the largest and best-designed cohorts can often only generate enough participants to detect the most important relative risks, investigate relatively common health and social issues, and provide limited potential to explore how environments interact with genetic factors to influence health. To address these issues and speed up discovery, more and more stakeholders are calling for a shift in the manner we conduct our science. Enabling timely access to research data and samples, increasing potential to share and integrate data across cohorts and promoting a multidisciplinary and collaborative approach to research are major assets of this new path. The ReACH initiative (Research Advancement through Cohort Cataloguing and Harmonization) responds to this demand by providing resources (comprehensive web-based catalogue and harmonization platform) to the Canadian research community to optimize the use of existing Canadian cohort data and samples, and leverage national and international DOHaD research collaborations."

Currently, non-genetic risks for breast cancer, such as environmental exposures, are not well understood. Laboratory studies have suggested that exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), a group of compounds added to plastic and other materials to reduce flammability, may influence breast cancer development. Exposure to PBDEs has been increasing in Canada since the 1960s and these compounds are now found in our environment, diet and bodies. North American levels of PBDEs found in human breast milk and blood samples are highly concerning, especially compared to those in Europe. This research will support the first study to look at the association between breast cancer development and PBDEs. Work will be done to develop effective questionnaires assessing PBDE exposure and to determine the validity of innovative data collection methods. The influence of specific diets, environmental and work-related exposures on PBDE levels in blood will also be examined. Study results will provide needed insight about the widespread and growing existence of PBDE exposure in the Canadian population and its influence on the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women."

By 2025, our goal is to ensure that every septic patient in Canada is identified and treated. Our slogan is: Suspect sepsis, save lives, support recovery!

We will learn which Canadians are at greatest risk of sepsis and the impact on their families. We will create a bank of evidence-based tools to teach the public and health workers and we will study new sepsis treatments.  As a result, more Canadians will be alive and well after sepsis, thanks to better and timely access to care. The healthcare system will save money (about $380 million dollars every year within the next 5 years). We will share our knowledge around the world so that every citizen of the planet will benefit."
Surveillance of Healthcare and Ambient Pathogens in our Environments and Spaces [SHAPES],"['Fralick, Michael P', 'Kassen, Rees', 'MacFadden, Derek R', 'Nott, Caroline', 'Wong, Alex']","['Castellani, Lucas', 'Doukhanine, Evgueni', 'Johnstone, Jennie', 'Manuel, Douglas G']","['Covid-19', 'Environmental Surveillance', 'Influenza', 'Long-Term Care Homes', 'Pathogen Surveillance', 'Respiratory Syncytial Virus (Rsv)', 'Sars-Cov-2']",100000.0,484194,"As an alternative to the time-consuming and resource-intensive process of testing individual humans, our team's previous work looked at how we can use environmental sampling to predict and potentially prevent COVID-19 outbreaks. The approach we developed uses swab samples taken from floors, which then undergo a lab processing technique that can detect the presence of the SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Through our work, we have discovered that the amount of SARS-CoV-2 we find on the floor correlates to the burden of infection in individual humans living and working in a given setting, and that the virus can be detected from floor samples days before an outbreak is recognized. This suggests a potential role for floor sampling in improving early outbreak identification and monitoring. We have further developed our approach to allow us to detect up to four different respiratory pathogens in one single test: SARS-CoV-2, influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

Our proposed work aims to provide ongoing surveillance at 10 long-term care homes for one year. We will conduct floor swabbing for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B, and RSV, and will send reports to each home on a twice-weekly basis. These reports will indicate the number of swabs positive for SARS-CoV-2, the location where the swab was taken, and the trends in swab positivity over time. We will look at the number and duration of outbreaks in homes who received swabbing and reporting compared with other homes who were not swabbed. We will look at whether the RSV and flu virus we find on the floors correlates to infection in LTC residents. We will also look at how floor swabbing compares to the current process of twice-weekly rapid antigen testing for LTC staff.

We hope to lay the groundwork for routine environmental surveillance of these common and potentially dangerous viruses, especially in settings where there are vulnerable people."

Our research has provided essential knowledge towards (i) understanding acquisition of and susceptibility to HPV infection, (ii) how HPV infection triggers carcinogenesis, (iii) establishing that HPV is a necessary cause of cervical cancer, (iv) providing evidence that HPV testing improves cervical cancer screening efficacy, and (v) proving that HPV vaccination prevents precancerous lesions. Our research has strengthened the cooperation between McGill and Université de Montréal and trained many leaders of cancer and STD control communities in Canada and abroad.We have recently begun a pragmatic phase of our research by focusing on opportunities for prevention using novel approaches with high translational potential. We launched two randomized controlled trials (RCT) of HPV prevention via a microbicidal gel (carrageenan), one for women (CATCH trial) and one for men who have sex with men (LIMIT-HPV trial). We began another RCT (TRAP-HPV study) to assess the value of HPV vaccination in reducing heterosexual HPV transmission. We plan to launch a new cervical self-sampling screening study (CASSIS trial) with the goal of validating a technique to increase cervical cancer screening coverage to remote areas (e.g., aboriginal populations or urban women who fail to attend screening). We are planning a study of artemisinin, a natural product and anti-malarial compound, for treating HPV-associated precancerous lesions in women and men.Our molecular epidemiological studies, some completed and some ongoing (e.g., HITCH cohort, BCCR case-control, McGill-Concordia cohort, Ludwig-McGill cohort, CCCaST RCT, HIPVIRG cohort) have accrued more than 40,000 cervical, anogenital, and serum specimens in a valuable biobank for translational studies and a wealth of data on risk factors and other variables. We began to investigate host and viral biomarkers for risk prediction, such as host and HPV DNA methylation, HLA polymorphisms, and HPV intratypic variation, viral load, and integration. For the CCCaST RCT, which includes more than 10,000 women, we plan to extend follow-up information and correlate that with HPV genotyping information at different points since enrolment. This would permit us to provide policymakers with evidence on the long-term safety of cervical cancer screening. Furthermore, using our biobank we hope to extend preliminary analyses on the value of testing for circulating HPV DNA as a correlate of disease progression and metastatic dissemination for cancers caused by HPV infection.Over the years we assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in epidemiology, microbiology, gynecology, pathology, dentistry, psychology, biostatistics, and immunology. This team will continue a tradition of mentoring many undergraduate and graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows via our two universities.HPV causes anogenital, upper aerodigestive tract, and non-melanoma skin cancers. In all, 10% of all cancers are likely caused by HPVs. Translational research is needed for sound cancer control and prevention policies involving HPV vaccination and HPV-based screening. Much remains to be learned concerning etiologic mechanisms, molecular targets, propensity for carcinogenesis, HPV acquisition and transmission, and the long-term impact of HPV-based technologies."

Most of the time, such infections are not noticed or cause only external warts. Although benign, warts are difficult to treat and lead to social stigmatization. However, there is a more ominous health consequence of HPV infection: cancer of the uterine cervix, a disease that can be fatal in about 40% of the women who are affected by it. Most HPV infections will not lead to cervical cancer, only those that involve certain types of this virus and that persist for a long time. Testing for HPV is a novel screening strategy that has the potential to detect more cases of precancerous cervical lesions than the traditional Pap test. As more and more physicians order these tests, there is increased awareness of how common such infections are among Canadian women (depending on age, 15%-40% have them). Women, their partners, and their physicians are left with many unanswered questions on how the infection is transmitted, how much risk there is after a sexual encounter, and what measures of protection can be achieved. This project will be the first in Canada to try to find answers to these questions."

A HF approach involves giving homeless people a place to live, and physical, mental, and psychosocial supports to help them improve their lives. HF is characterized by tenant choice and low-barrier tenancy requirements.4, 85HF is a new model with impressive impacts, especially in housing stability. The Mental Health Commission of Canada’s At Home/Chez Soi project found that HF is effective in reducing homelessness and helping those with mental illness, addictions, etc. (our team co-led the Vancouver and Toronto sites).HF gets people into housing, but what next?Housing stability is viewed as an important pre/co-requisite for improvement in health and other areas of life, and ultimately to function independently in the broader community. Increasingly, studies on HF are measuring other tenant outcomes such as community functioning. However, knowledge on this topic has not yet been synthesized. We propose to conduct the first realist synthesis on HF and community functioning, in order to aid homelessness/HF decision-makers who currently do not have an evidence base to determine which aspects of HF help improve community functioning for tenants. A realist synthesis is the ideal method to study complex approaches such as HF.66Our question is “How do housing/support interventions used in HF help tenants to gain improved community functioning?"" and will specifically address: 1) the expected chain of results of housing/support interventions (program theory); 2) their reported outcomes; 3) who is reported to be affected (both positively/negatively); and 4) the mechanisms/contextual elements that help to explain the outcomes.We will follow the 5iterativestages of realist synthesis outlined by Pawson66: 1) clarify the scope (e.g., articulate key theories of HF and community functioning); 2) search for evidence (e.g., published and grey literature, snowball); 3) appraise primary studies and extract data (e.g., does the research support the theory under test); 4) synthesize evidence and draw conclusions (e.g., refine program theory); and 5) disseminate (e.g., to key homelessness/HF decision-makers). The initial parameters of our realist synthesis (we will expand/refine these) include a HF program logic model and HF Fidelity Scale,102English language, 1995-current, and the measurement of tenant community functioning as an outcome of HF (primary study/evaluation). We will use the context-mechanism-outcome framework to guide our work. This framework is suited to answer questions about what works for whom under what circumstances. We anticipate that the evidence supporting each linkage in the program chain will be heterogeneous and complex. Conclusions are anticipated to be a series of contextualized decision points (e.g., if A, then B).Our review will provide policy makers, service providers, and professionals with timely and important new insights into the implementation and effectiveness of HF approaches for tenants. Ultimately, our realist synthesis is part of an overall research agenda to inform policy and practice to improve health and quality-of-life outcomes for homeless persons so that they can become engaged in the broader community instead of being ill, marginalized, and isolated."

This research is needed because current approaches to assessing the impact of urban environments on health defines ¿environment¿ too narrowly, and often measures environmental variables that have little relevance to communities who experience the greatest exposure to harm. We plan to use photography as a method to access community knowledge about ways that experiences in disadvantaged neighbourhoods impact the social determinants of health. The aim is to use this knowledge to improve the community relevance of environmental health assessment in urban settings in order to empower communities to support public health action. Community members from low-income neighbourhoods, Parkdale (Toronto) and Oppenheimer (Vancouver) will be trained on the use of photography as a research tool to document their health-related experiences in their neighbourhoods. They will then carry out field visits to low, medium, and high income neighbourhoods to take photos of things that make their neighbourhood particularly healthy or unhealthy relative to other neighbourhoods in the city. They will then gather their photos together to construct themes about environmental health inequity and the social determinants of health. A report of these themes will be written and discussed in a multisectoral workshop as the basis for the development of actionable indicators to support community-centred environmental justice action. Results will be broadly disseminated and discussed in order to build momentum for the development of a CIHR Operating Grant application aimed at developing community-relevant assessment and intervention tools that are designed to understand and overcome the complex social and physical determinants of health inequity that are entrenched in urban environments."

The links between the design of cities and physical activity  (PA) levels has been the subject of several studies in recent years. We know that getting enough exercise helps people stay fit and maintain a healthy weight and we know that healthy weight and being active leads to less chronic disease. What we don't know is whether there is a link between the design of cities and how much healthcare costs. Canadian healthcare costs from chronic disease have been rising rapidly in recent years. Upstream policies that reduce health care costs by keeping people healthier are needed. This study will examine if adults in the Lower Mainland of British Columbia who live in places where neighborhood design makes it easy to walk and bike have lower healthcare costs than similar adults living in places that discourage walking and biking. The project will use databases that measure how easy it is to walk and bike in urban areas to evaluate the design of cities. It will use data from the BC Generations Project of over 15,000 participants to look at PA, diet, and weight; and information from Population Data BC to measure healthcare use and costs. First, we will look at the relationship between the built environment and PA. Next, we will study the link between built environment and activity-related diseases when taking physical activity into account. Third, we will consider the relationship between built environment and health care use costs, incorporating what we learn from the first two steps. Finally, using health care cost data over multiple years, linked to home address, we will see how health care costs change for people who move to a new address. The study will investigate the entire pathway: from design of cities, to PA, to health, and, finally, to healthcare costs. The results of this study will help leaders in public health, urban policy, and transportation planning to work towards healthy design."

The extensive, individual-level data from 50,000 people that will be collected in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) provides an ideal platform for studies of the impact of the neighbourhood environment on health. Furthermore, there are other detailed Canadian data-sets on the neighbourhood environment which can be combined with the CLSA data for new research. It is timely to build a new research network to carry out a research agenda on aging and the environment. Our Workshop will bring together International experts in the built and social environments with experts in aging research, policy and services, and will serve as a springboard for building this network and research agenda, and for developing research grants for several Canadian cities. The Workshop will yield new partnerships and concrete plans for new research and learning that can ultimately re-shape policy, practice and community design to encourage and support healthy aging, including active participation of older adults in all aspects of community life. The Workshop will be integrated with a CLSA Public Forum on healthy aging and the environment. The integration of these events conforms to CIHR's Citizen Engagement Framework, creating an opportunity for Workshop organizers and participants to have a conversation with the public and other stakeholders about their perceptions of neighbourhood impacts on health and aging.

These effects may differ between boys and girls. Events during pregnancy are suspected to change the reading of the human genome, and thus increase the risk of development of certain disorders. However, the present state of knowledge does not allow us to specify which factors are harmful for the baby during pregnancy. The first aim of this research program is to identify the specific factors leading to low birth weight in boys and girls. We will examine how nutritional imbalances, stressful events and maternal diseases during pregnancy affect the growth and development of the babies. 
It remains uncertain which cellular mechanisms are involved in translating fetal 'exposure' to a high risk environmental factors into adverse health outcomes. Recent studies strongly suggest that ""epigenetic"" factors play an important role. The term epigenetics refers to chemical modifications of the DNA that change the way that the 'message' coded in the genes is read. We know that the environment of the baby in the womb can produce epigenetic 'marks' that may be different in boys and girls and that these changes can increase the risk of developing chronic diseases. However, the epigenetic changes specific to low birth weight boys and girls are yet unknown. Therefore, our second aim is to identify those epigenetic marks.  Finally (third aim), the long term health impacts of these environmental factors in low birth weight babies and the epigenetic changes that they produce will be respectively assessed in children at 6 years old. Understanding why and how some boys and girls are more likely to develop obesity, cardiovascular and neurodevelopmental disorders later in their life is central to our research program. We expect that this will lead to new targets for the treatment and prevention of these diseases."

Collaborative, participatory policy making between Indigenous people and policy makers requires two-way communication, however mutual exchange can be challenging as policy discourses and Indigenous ways of speaking and knowing may have underlying philosophical differences, including different understandings of knowledge. This research uses knowledge translation models to examine how knowledge held within Indigenous communities can be translated into policy discourse, in order to promote the inclusion of Indigenous voices in public health policy and decision making. Working in partnership with Indigenous leaders and public health decision makers, qualitative interviews will be used to achieve two objectives: a) to explore the role of knowledge translation between Indigenous people and policy makers, and b) to inform the development of a framework to guide ethical collaborative policy making processes between Indigenous people and public health decision makers. Drawing from community-based, critical inquiry and qualitative methodologies, these objectives will be met by conducting a literature review on knowledge translation tools to support public participation in policy making, an historical analysis of Indigenous involvement in policy making, and interviews with key stakeholders in Indigenous public health in Canada.

This study, involving a team of academic researchers, community leaders, Indigenous Elders, school heads, injury prevention specialists, and others, is centered on the efficacy of culturally focused, land-based outdoor education for fostering urban Indigenous youth leadership in the area of unintentional injury prevention. Of particular interest is the manner in which cultural safety, a critical understanding of Indigenous injuries, and peer teaching opportunities influence the ways in which Indigenous youth leaders in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada understand and act in relation to unintentional injury prevention. A related focus is an examination of the impact of cultural learning modalities, such as those associated with hunting and fishing, for inspiring the creative development of an injury prevention resource, to be used by youth leaders to teach safety skills and knowledge to their rural and urban peers. The study employs communitybased participatory research methodology, an approach to research that seeks to put communities in the lead on inquiry and action on urgent Indigenous health issues. Access to the research outcomes, and to the injury prevention resource itself will be promoted through social media technologies. Given a fast growing, young Indigenous population with increasing access to the Internet, the impact of this study has significant potential to extend nationally and beyond. The research will also be disseminated in traditional academic contexts, and to key policy makers e.g. school boards, municipalities, and government departments, providing a strong incentive for changes to policy that reflect Indigenous-focused injury prevention strategies that work."

Previous research has shown that regular physical activity can improve the physical and psychological function of breast cancer survivors, help manage some short term side effects of treatment and reduce the risk of having a recurrence. However, this research has not been adopted into regular oncology practice because specific exercise advice cannot be provided regarding the type and volume of exercise necessary for improving quality of life and survival of breast cancer survivors. We initiated the Alberta Moving Beyond Breast Cancer cohort study in 2011 with a CIHR Team Grant. The aim is to determine if physical activity can help breast cancer survivors manage the side effects of treatments, enhance quality of life, reduce their risk of disease recurrence and improve survival. Study participants are asked to complete questionnaires, undergo tests for physical fitness tests and lymphedema (swelling in the arms), have their body composition measured (body fat, lean mass, bone density), give a fasting blood sample and wear devices that objectively measure their physical activity and sedentary behavior (time spent sitting) at breast cancer diagnosis and again at 1, 3, and 5 years. They are then followed for breast cancer outcomes. To date, we have recruited 75% of our cohort of 1500 and are now seeking funding to complete the recruitment and follow-up of all participants. A better understanding of precisely how physical activity and physical fitness affect breast cancer recurrence and survival will lead to improvements in exercise recommendations for breast cancer survivors."

"Identifying rural-urban differences in access to treatment and harms associated with alcohol use disorder in Ontario, Canada","['Friesen, Erik L']",['N/A'],"['Addiction', 'Alcohol Use Disorder', 'Alcohol-Related Harm', 'Healthcare Access', 'Rural Health']",105000.0,417029,"Alcohol use is a leading cause of death and disease. In Canada, over 70,000 people are hospitalized yearly for alcohol-related reasons and alcohol-related emergency room visits in Ontario have increased by 82% since 2003. Rural communities have almost two times higher rates of alcohol-related hospitalization than urban centers. In turn, there is an urgent need to develop public health strategies to reduce the burden of alcohol-related harm in rural Canada. The development of these strategies has been limited by an incomplete understanding of rural alcohol use and its related harms.

Limited access to addiction treatment for individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD, known colloquially as 'alcoholism') is thought to contribute to the increased burden of alcohol-related harm in rural communities. AUD is characterized by uncontrolled alcohol consumption and withdrawal symptoms during periods of abstinence. Treatment is provided by specialized healthcare workers and is effective at reducing the severity of AUD and risk of downstream harms, such as alcohol-related hospitalization or mortality. If rural communities face limited access to AUD treatment, which is likely given that rural communities have limited access to most specialist care, this would foreseeably increase both the prevalence of AUD and the risk of alcohol-related harm amongst those with AUD.

No research has investigated rural-urban disparities in access to AUD treatment or the impact this has on downstream alcohol-related harm. The purpose of my research is to address this gap in knowledge. My specific aims are to evaluate the Ontario population for rural-urban differences in access to AUD treatment and the resulting effect on alcohol-related hospitalizations, emergency room visits and mortality. This research will lay a framework for similar studies to be conducted in other provinces and territories and will guide the formation of public health strategies to reduce alcohol-related harm in rural Canada."

The aims of this research are to 1) validate the use of sensor instrumented mouthguards (iMGs) in the detection of head acceleration events (HAEs) through use of video monitoring across a variety of high-risk sports (e.g., wrestling, rugby, ice hockey), 2) examine modifiable risk factors and mechanisms of concussion through multimodel methods using iMGs, video monitoring, and injury surveillance, and 3) examine the cumulative effect of HAEs on brain oxygenation and clinical concussion symptoms. We hypothesize that 1) iMGs will reliably measure HAEs, 2) number and magnitude of HAEs will increase likelihood of injury and concussion, as well as 3) decrease brain oxygenation and increase severity of clinical concussion symptoms. Youth athletes across a variety of high-risk sports will wear iMGs in-game with video monitoring of iMG HAEs to determine magnitude and mechanism of HAEs. Pre- and post-game neuroimaging and clinical symptom surveys will be used to assess effects of in-game exposure on brain oxygen. Finally, season long injury surveillance will be used to identify concussion injuries and risk. Prevent Biometrics® iMGs are shown to reliably measure HAEs. The SHRed Injuries web-based injury surveillance system has been validated in youth high school sport. Neuroimaging procedures shows brain oxygen can be reliably measured within-day. Ability to monitor effects of in-game exposure is critical to understanding injury rate, mechanism, and severity of concussion to aid prevention and rehabilitation efforts."

To date the ISIS sample includes 2093 participants, aged 18 to 25, living on the Island of Montreal. Between November 2011 to August 2012 all participants responded to an individual-level questionnaire regarding their individual socio-demographic characteristics (qualified as capitals following Pierre Bourdieu's capital theory) and their history with smoking. At the neighbourhood level we have aggregate data from a GIS system as well as subjective observations of the neighbourhoods in which our sample lives. While we already have an enormous amount of rich data from which to work from, what is still missing is a better appreciation of how social inequities in health arise locally as well as a better appreciation of the social, cultural and historical local contexts of each of these neighbourhoods, how people use and interact with their neighbourhood, and what the various resources in each neighborhood mean to people in their daily lives. A qualitative method entitled The Go-along method is a unique technique that makes it possible for researchers to observe usual spatial practices is situ while having access to participants' experiences and interpretations at the same time. By combining a combination of life history with neighbourhood experience, we will be better able to contextualise our individual level quantitative data as well as the relationship between the individual level data, and differential smoking prevalence. By collecting qualitative data we will be better able to triangulate our data from our earlier ISIS data collection phase and better understand how to address these inequities with future interventions."

The visible presence of children and youth of different ages and backgrounds, with and without their parents, outside in city streets, sidewalks, yards, and open spaces is a sign of the health of human habitats.  Indeed, the extent to which a neighbourhood supports children's outdoor play - ie. its playability - can be directly linked not only to children's health, levels of obesity and psychological well-being, but also to the population's well-being as a whole.  Research concerns about stranger-danger, traffic accidents and a general lack of safe, enticing places for children and youth to play outdoors, have been partially responsible for children and youth becoming more sedentary and remaining indoors to play.  Concomitantly there has been an increasing interest in promoting children and youth's outdoor play due to the myriad of benefits it is shown to provide.  This proposal takes children and youth's outdoor play as a critical public health issue that can help municipal policy makers, public health practitioners, active transport advocates, urban designers, child advocates and society in general join the dots between complex issues like pollution and global warming, active transport planning and community cohesion on the one hand, and concerns regarding the physical and mental health of both children and adults on the other."

These Cafe Scientifiques are oriented towards two main groups, the local African newcomer youth at large and the adults from African newcomer communities as well as the general public, in order to discuss research findings and to engage in conversations about the issues facing the youth. In particular, anthropologist researchers, peer researchers, and local service providers and knowledge users will present their points of view on topics related to sexual health as a human right, about sexuality as a taboo topic within African communities, and about the stigma experienced by African youth in their navigation of new sexual cultural norms. The launching of a website created by youth participants of a CIHR project will be used as a means to spark discussion. The voices of the youth will be encouraged by providing a Junior Cafe for them exclusively while at the same time the panelists will seek to engage the wider general public and adults from newcomer communities in a youth-focused presentation."
"The association between traffic-related air pollution, childhood allergic rhinitis and genetic variability","['Fuertes, Elaine I']",['N/A'],"['Air Pollution', 'Allergic Rhinitis', 'Asthma', 'Birth Cohort', 'Gene-Environment Interaction', 'International Collaborations', 'Multiple Regression Modelling', 'Oxidative Stress', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms', 'Traffic']",105000.0,257433,"Environmental factors, such as air pollution and environmental tobacco smoke, are increasingly linked to the onset and exacerbation of respiratory diseases. In particular, a growing number of studies have identified traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) as  contributing to the onset of childhood allergic rhinitis, although the results are not always consistent. In fact, the question still remains as to why TRAP increases the risk of allergic disease development and exacerbates symptoms only in certain susceptible subgroups. One prominent hypothesis is that TRAP may interact with certain genes involved in the defense mechanism of the body to toxins (principally, pathways for metabolism of oxidative species), thereby decreasing or increasing the risk of developing allergic rhinitis. However, it remains unclear which genes are most influential and how these genes interact with the environment to modify their effect. 

This project aims to improve our understanding of whether TRAP affects the onset of childhood allergic rhinitis and how the genetic makeup of an individual can influence this association. We will utilize a unique international collaboration in which we will assimilate information on air pollution, genetics, lifestyle, and disease previously collected by studies in Canada, England, The Netherlands, Germany and Sweden. These data will be strategically combined and used to determine whether children who live in urban areas with high traffic density are more likely to develop allergic rhinitis than those who do not. Finally, we will investigate whether individuals with specific genetic compositions are more susceptible to the effects of TRAP.

The results of this study will yield insight as to how early-life environmental factors can affect the development of respiratory diseases during childhood, especially among genetically susceptible individuals."

These and other big programs like cancer screening and anti-smoking laws are very hard to evaluate. This is because there are an incredible number of things, like your age or income, that could bias the results of the evaluation. To solve the problem of bias researchers use a method called the randomized controlled trial. Randomized controlled trials are the best way to understand how medications or surgeries work and if they should be allowed on the market. But randomized controlled trials have weaknesses when it comes to understanding big programs like transportation or poverty reduction. There are some new research methods that keep all of the good parts of randomized controlled trials and help improve some of their weaknesses for understanding big programs. Unfortunately, these new methods have not been used very much in health research.

During my project I will learn and use these new methods to understand how big programs like transportation and poverty reduction influence health. This is important because if our understanding of these big programs is biased we can never be sure if they are good or bad for health. If we can never be sure if they are good or bad for health we will not be able to change these programs and make them the most beneficial for everyone's health."

In 2017, we launched a population health intervention research program with stakeholders and community groups in Victoria, Vancouver, Saskatoon, and Montreal. Since then, we have recruited over 2200 participants to our cohorts, and done qualitative interviews with over 100 residents living near the interventions. 

The main goal of INTERACT is to evaluate the impact of built environment interventions on health and health equity. Building on our past work INTERACT will add to the research of healthy cities, with more attention to design, implementation, and equity. We have three objectives: 1) we will describe how health and equity are considered in the design of built environment interventions; 2) Examine the patterns of where built environment interventions are made and for who, over time; and 3) Evaluate impacts of built environment interventions on health outcomes and health equity.

We study four built environment interventions, identified with city partners. In Victoria, the All Ages and Abilities Cycling Network; in Vancouver, the City Greenways Plan; in Saskatoon, the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT); and in Montreal, ecological transition and resilience policies like greening, place-making, traffic-calming, and transportation interventions.

Significant delays in implementation and reporting of robust research findings on SARS-CoV-2 vaccine safety and efficacy, as well as infection outcomes, has led to considerable vaccine hesitancy in the vulnerable pregnant population.  
Primarily, this research project will use extensive demographic, epidemiological, and clinical data from an established large prospective cohort study (the P3 cohort study) on 4000 pregnant women and their infants in Alberta, Canada, with follow-up continuing until 1 year postpartum. A sub-study on vaccine willingness and perceptions will also be done. Analysis of this data will provide accurate estimates of the risk of various health outcomes (e.g. pregnancy complications, neonatal complications) following SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnant women and infants. It will give vital information on the real-world safety and efficacy of vaccination in a representative Canadian population, along with key insights into the necessity and timing of 'booster' shots. 
Secondarily, electronic medical record (EMR) data for participants will be compared to similar data from the prospective P3 cohort study. A validation will be done of the EMR data to see if it can be used in the future for rapidly implementing robust research on emerging infections in pregnancy. In areas (i.e. certain data types) where EMR is not valid, statistical approaches will be trialed to facilitate optimal use of this information for pandemic preparedness.
The results of this study will be shared with other researchers as well as with the public through internal (University of Calgary), regional (SARS-CoV-2 and perinatal epidemiology networks within Alberta and Canada), and international (World Health Organization) collaborations. This research will be completed over a period of two years."

We aim to address the ongoing lack of control over access to traditional and culturally safe foods in long-term care homes. Cultural barriers continue to prevent Indigenous Peoples from accessing foods that meet their needs and likes. This is even more of a problem for Indigenous residents of long-term care homes because they can no longer shop, grow, hunt, gather, or prepare their own meals and are away from their community. Indigenous Peoples are living longer yet they tend to have many health challenges connected to barriers to culturally informed care, including a lack of access to foods that are in line with their traditional preferences. It is important for long-term care homes to offer culturally relevant foods so that Indigenous residents feel safe and welcome living there. Indigenous Peoples must be able to see themselves, their history, and their culture in their care. This project brings together Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers and community partners to identify and share new ways of thinking about how long-term care for Indigenous Peoples can be transformed by Indigenous wisdom, knowledge, and cultures, to promote access to cultural relevant food. We will review policies, and use sharing circles, photos, interviews, and visits to Indigenous-led long-term care homes and community food programs to learn through experiencing, storytelling, and seeing. We will bring together many different views and experiences and make sure that the teachings of Indigenous elders and knowledge keepers and the voices of Indigenous women are heard.

For example, among aboriginal communities, one in five neonates is born from mothers who used opioids during pregnancy. Prescriptions from doctors who treat chronic and severe pain are the source of many abused opioids. Many communities are trying to promote the appropriate use of prescription opioids in order to reduce the abuse of these important medications.

Each year, thousands of older adults lose their lives after a fall, and thousands more are admitted to hospital with serious injuries. Falls are the top cause of concussions in older adults. A concussion is a type of brain injury that can affect a person in many ways, for example, dizziness, headaches, memory problems, and trouble with walking and balance. For older adults, these symptoms may not be noticed, especially if the person already has balance problems, are on certain medications, or has dementia, thus older adults might not get checked for a concussion and get the care they need to heal from their injury. Older adults experience concussion in a different way, often take longer to heal, and have their own unique concerns and hopes for their recovery compared to younger ages. There are guidelines and tools used by healthcare providers to assess and diagnose a concussion, and to manage recovery. There are guidelines for children and adults, but no specific information for when their patient is an older adult.

For all ages, falls in bathrooms are common and the most severe. There is a growing need to invest in accessible, low-cost, sustainable policy-level approaches that reduce bathroom falls. Evidence demonstrates grab bars are effective in reducing fall hazards, improving independence and accessibility while bathing and reducing the risk of injury. Evidence demonstrates that Canadians, particularly older adults, support using and installing grab bars. Despite this, interventions to proactively include grab bars in buildings are lacking. There are opportunities for collective and strategic action, e.g., updates to the National Building Code and provincial/territorial building codes, raising public awareness of the benefits of grab bars, reducing stigma and misperceptions around their use. This project will help understand what multidisciplinary stakeholders need to support the installation of grab bars in bathrooms by hosting an in-person meeting with stakeholders from across Canada from healthcare, research, injury prevention, real estate, construction, building management, manufacturers, insurance and more. We will ask participants about the information and tools they need and identify collective opportunities for action across policy, research, public awareness, and implementation. Post summit, we will create a report of findings and priorities for action, informed and reviewed by stakeholders with dissemination to stakeholders who are interested in and could act on the information, with the goal to catalyze policy-level changes that support grab bar installation.

This research will explore Aboriginal health providers and Aboriginal women's priorities, practices, perceptions and expectations within the context of primary health care and community development principles by Participatory Action Research. It will describe the complexity and issues surrounding Aboriginal women's health in remote areas of British Columbia, specifically a central-coast First Nations community. The Aboriginal population, which is concentrated in the more remote areas of the province, has a health status that is inferior to that of the non-Aboriginal population in the same area. Using quantitative and qualitative methods, this research is proposing to identify the elements of a successfully established Aboriginal women's health program as part of the provincially funded British Columbia Women's Hospital and Health Centre Foundation that would support transfer and adaptation to a second remote community in British Columbia.

For the current and forthcoming generations, the climate crisis and COVID-19 pandemic threaten to exacerbate mental health risks. Exposures including family socioeconomic disadvantage and discrimination can increase risks of future mental health problems, whereas safe and stable early environments can promote mental health. The interactions between risk and protective factors are complex: multiple social and physical exposures in children's early environments can combine to compound or attenuate developmental risks. Using an ecological systems model and intersectionality perspectives, our proposed research capitalizes on a unique longitudinal population-level data platform to investigate the impacts of multiple intersecting risk and protective factors across the early life course from birth to young adulthood. This data platform includes teacher and child/adolescent self reported mental health linked to birth, medical records, family and neighbourhood socio-demographic characteristics, and environmental exposures. Data measuring multiple contextual factors and the timing of exposures will enable us to assess associations between early life course mental health and key exposures of interest including parent mental health history, socio-economic status, green space, and events related to the pandemic and climate crisis. We will focus specifically on population sub-groups and communities typically under-represented in research including children living in rural and remote areas, children who are new to Canada, and children from families with socioeconomic disadvantages who may be disproportionately impacted by these exposures. We will utilize an integrated knowledge translation approach to provide contextualized and actionable evidence that health professionals, policy-makers, schools, and communities can use to improve child and youth mental health outcomes."
Mortality risks in later life from exposure to pandemic influenza in early life:  the 1890 and 1918 influenza pandemics in Canada,"['Gagnon, Alain']","['Earn, David J', 'Herring, Ann', 'Madrenas, Joaquin', 'Miller, Matthew S']","['Antigenic Imprinting', 'Fetal Origin Hypothesis', 'Historical Demography', 'Immunity', 'Influenza Pandemic', 'Lifecourse', 'Mortality', 'Record Linkage']",272567.0,268176,"The worldwide spread of a novel influenza A (H1N1) virus in 2009 reminds us that influenza still represents a significant threat to public health. As was the case during its famous predecessor in 1918, the H1N1 strain that circulated in 2009 primarily targeted age-groups that are usually spared by influenza: adolescents and young adults. This project attempts to solve the mystery of high young adult mortality during the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918. We hypothesize that exposure to a virulent strain of influenza during critical periods of development results in physiological impairments that increase the risk of death from pandemic influenza in later life. We also posit that developing specific antibodies to a given influenza strain in early life may actually subvert the immune system, thereby increasing the risk of death when the individual is infected by a novel strain in later life. We will test whether early life exposure to pandemic influenza in 1890 increased the risk of dying from influenza during the next pandemic of 1918.  To do this, we will link exact ages at death from publicly available historical records for Ontario and Quebec to information contained in census and other records that describe each individual's socioeconomic and environmental conditions during exposure to influenza and in later life. Drawing on historical demographic data and taking advantage of the most recent advances in developmental biology and immunology, this project brings a novel and exciting alternative to commonly held views about the unusual age pattern of mortality in 1918. Such knowledge could substantially improve crisis management were a new virulent and similarly age-patterned outbreak of influenza to emerge again on the world stage."

L'expérience des acteurs de santé publique au Québec montre que le recours à des avis scientifiques ou revues de connaissances varie beaucoup lors de la formulation des politiques. Par exemple, les connaissances sur les risques pour la santé de l'utilisation de l'amiante ont eu un impact limité sur les décideurs gouvernementaux tandis que les connaissances sur l'utilisation du cellulaire au volant ont mené à des modifications de la réglementation. Cela a conduit notre équipe à s'intéresser aux conditions favorisant l'utilisation des connaissances lors de la formulation des politiques publiques.
Nos travaux antérieurs ont montré la pertinence d'étudier de plus près la dynamique entre les groupes d'acteurs liés à un domaine de politiques publiques, comme la sécurité routière, la pauvreté ou la qualité de l'eau potable. Récemment, des chercheurs ont distingué différentes configurations pour qualifier la dynamique entre ces groupes. Ils suggèrent que l'utilisation des connaissances produites par les experts varie selon l'une ou l'autre de ces configurations.
Par l'examen de différents cas, ce projet contribuera à renforcer les connaissances existantes en étudiant de plus près les conditions de mise à profit des connaissances. Les résultats obtenus seront ensuite transposés dans un format permettant aux acteurs de santé publique d'apprécier ces conditions et d'anticiper les stratégies à mettre de l'avant dans un domaine particulier d'intervention. Ce projet vise donc à maximiser les retombées des connaissances scientifiques sur la santé de la population en améliorant la prise en compte des impacts sur la santé dans les politiques publiques."

Il est donc nécessaire de développer des indicateurs pertinents et éloquents pour la pratique clinique et pour en effectuer la surveillance.
Le but du projet est de développer des indicateurs de polypharmacie basés sur des données probantes, de tester leur capacité à prédire les hospitalisations liées aux chutes et d'en déterminer l'effet causal chez les aînés québécois.
À partir de divers indicateurs de polypharmacie utilisés en recherche, et suite à l'identification d'autres facteurs liés à l'exposition aux médicaments (par classes médicamenteuses, interactions documentées, listes de médicaments potentiellement inappropriés, etc.), des indicateurs de polypharmacie seront développés et testés pour prédire les hospitalisations liées aux chutes.

In light of the recent expansion of antiretroviral treatment coverage, the use of antiretroviral treatment as prevention, and the introduction of antiretroviral treatment as pre-exposure prophylaxis, we believe that more explorative and descriptive research on this particular topic is warranted. The proposed project draws on Deleuze and Guattari's concept of assemblage and will follow the methodological principles of grounded theory."

When researchers do try to partner, they are often accused of tokenism (i.e. asking research users to endorse research to legitimize programs over which they have little real control). The gap separating research discovery and implementation is of particular concern for the over 86,000 individuals with spinal cord injuries (SCI) in Canada. SCI results from damage to the spinal cord due to trauma or disease and leads to partial or complete paralysis and sensory impairment. 

To combat tokenism in spinal cord injury (SCI) research and enhance research impact, a multidisciplinary partnership of researchers, research users, and/or funders was established to develop guidance to advance meaningful, equitable, and authentic research partnerships. This partnership systematically and rigorously co-developed, disseminated, and evaluated ""integrated knowledge translation (IKT) guiding principles for conducting and disseminating SCI research in partnership"". Our eight principles represent what is desirable and positive for conducting quality, inclusive, and ethical SCI research in partnership.

In the Fall of 2020, our IKT Guiding Principles were published.  In February 2021, the partnership led a coordinated launch of the principles in both French and English (see www.IKTprinciples.com). Our partnership has been internationally recognized as global leaders in advancing the science of integrated knowledge translation (IKT) and addressing tokenism in SCI research. Together, we are combatting tokenism and improving the quality and quantity of SCI research partnerships. In turn, we are evolving the field of research partnership in Canada and internationally amongst researchers, research users, and funding agencies within and beyond SCI research."

The only environmental factor known to increase the risk of developing CMM is sun exposure. Although the great majority of the more than 30 past studies have shown a positive relationship between sun exposure and CMM, the elevated risk in those most exposed tends to be modest. This has spurred recent attempts to see if other environmental exposures may also increase melanoma risk.

Recently we examined the relationship between blood levels of organochlorine compounds (PCBs and chlorine-based pesticides)and risk of melanoma in a small group of melanoma patients and healthy controls. After adjusting for sun sensitivity and sunlight exposure (known risk fators for melanoma) we found strong relationships between blood levels of several PCBs and risk of CMM. However, this study was of a preliminary nature with relatively small numbers of patients, and thus the findings need to be confirmed in a larger study. We propose to enroll 400 melanoma patients and 400 healthy controls to see if results confirm those seen in the original study. We will collect information on variables such as skin and hair colour, skin sensitivity to sunlight, and history of sun exposure. In addition we will collect a blood sample from each participant. Plasma from the blood sample will be assayed for residues of 14 PCB types (congeners)and 11 pesticides. 

Multivariate statistical techniques will then be used to evaluate whether results confirm a relationship between organochlorine levels and melanoma after control for pigmentation, sun sensitivity and sun exposure. Findings from our study could provide new leads for prevention of melanoma and help reverse the rising incidence of melanoma in the Canadian population."

My research program conducts ongoing assessment, intervention, health policy research with the goal of reducing chronic disease in northern populations. Assessment research examines how patterns of child growth and nutrition are changing; Canadian Inuit children are no longer shorter than southern populations, for example, and if they continue to grow at the current rate, they will be the tallest generation of Inuit ever to live in Canada. Adult bodies are also changing in response to their environments. Younger Inuit no longer consume a large portion of their diet in the form of fish and marine mammals, a fact which may lead to increased risk of diabetes and heart disease in the coming years. It is important to monitor these changes in growth and dietary patterns in order to provide health promotion and treatment programs tailored to the particular needs of the Inuit population. 

Interventions are already underway in many northern communities. My research evaluates whether programs to promote healthy lifestyles, including school-based games and young harvester training programs, are doing a good job of exposing children and youth to the healthful benefits of traditional Inuit practices. Early results show that these programs are producing positive effects that go beyond increasing physical activity and exposing children to a wide range of nutritious, healthy, traditional foods. Participating in culturally-derived activities is increasing Inuit children's confidence and self-esteem, promoting responsibility and sharing behaviour, and increasing ties between family and community members. Children are becoming valued carriers of positive health messages, a fact that underscores the importance of investing in child and youth development."

The ambivalence expressed by northern community members with regard to southern-owned retail is as old as colonialism itself. The ways in which corporations affect the daily lives of Indigenous people reach beyond market food and into domains as important to cultural identity as traditional harvest and food sharing. It is imperative that these processes are understood by local knowledge-makers working within their local contexts.

The proposed research examines the role played by northern retail and re-supply in advancing the food security and food sovereignty of Indigenous peoples in Canada. By examining northern retail at multiple scales, our study examines how current policy and business environments constrain self-determination in the area of community retail and re-supply. These environments affect both market food access and traditional harvest activities since the bulk of material supports for harvest and agriculture must be purchased through existing southern-owned retail and wholesale channels. The situation is worsened by climate instability hindering reliable surface (land and sea) and air transportation. Our goal is to provide regional governments and federal policymakers with relevant, timely assessment of the conditions necessary to support northern community-controlled stores and other creative forms of community re-supply. Working across four northern regions of Canada that represent a diverse range of contexts, we will develop, implement and evaluate models for federal and local supports that increase the autonomy and control of northern communities over the retail and re-supply aspects of their food systems."

EMBOLDEN aimed to address this gap by working with OAs and community partners to create a new program to improve mobility and address health inequities.   

The EMBOLDEN team includes researchers, trainees, OAs and community service providers. This team has experience in partnering with and supporting less-served communities. The researchers have expertise in nursing, kinesiology, medicine, nutrition, geography, epidemiology, sociology, humanities, public health, health policy and applying research to practice.  Our Strategic Guiding Council (SGC) includes diverse OAs and providers who identified the priorities for increasing OAs' mobility and community connections.  

Our co-design objectives were to i) engage OAs and providers to explore existing strengths, needs, enablers and barriers faced by diverse/less-served OAs and ii) design a program based on evidence and experiences to improve mobility and health, building on community strengths and lived expertise.    

The co-design process identified key features relevant to OAs and partners who deliver programs to OAs. The program promotes physical activity, nutrition, socializing, and system navigation. A pilot study confirmed that the program is feasible and acceptable. Participants reported improved health and connections with others.

Association of Toll-Like Receptor 2 Gene Polymorphisms  with Airway Hyporesponsiveness in Full-Time Workers in Swine Operations,"['Gao, Zhiwei']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1200.0,252989,"Background:Workers in swine operations are exposed to bacteria, virus, and dusts.  These exposures have been associated with variable impacts on respiratory health which may be related to variations in individual susceptibility.  We investigated the effects of polymorphisms in the Toll-Like Receptor 2 (TLR2) and Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) genes on lung function in workers from swine operations and non-farming controls. 
Methods:374 full-time workers from large swine operations and 411 non-farming rural dwellers were chosen for the study.  Information on demography, lifestyle and occupation was collected using a questionnaire.  Pulmonary function measurements and blood samples were also obtained. Differences in the lung function parameters between different genotypes of each SNP in the TLR2 and TLR4 genes were estimated after controlling for age, sex, height, weight and smoking habit using multiple linear regression techniques.
Results:Workers with TLR2 polymorphisms, Thr399Ile (AG), Arg677Trp (CT or TT) and Arg753Ile (AA) had significantly greater mean values of FEV1, FEV1/FVC ratio and FEF25%-75% than workers with wild-type for the three SNPs, respectively, after controlling for age, sex, height, weight, and smoking habit.  No significant differences were observed in the mean values of lung function parameters between the polymorphism and wild-type groups of the three SNPs in the TLR2 gene among non-farming controls.  For the TLR4 gene, there were no significant differences in the mean values of lung function parameters between the polymorphic (AG or GG) and wild-type (AA) groups of Asp299Gly polymorphism and between the polymorphic (CT) and wild-type (TT) groups of Thr399Ile polymorphism in workers in the swine operations or non-farming controls.
Conclusions:Our study is the first to report the respiratory health effects of TLR2 polymorphisms among workers in swine operations.  TLR4 polymorphisms appeared to be of less importance in this population than TLR2."

It is currently the fourth leading cause of death globally and is expected to be the third leading cause of death by 2030. Recently, a new obstructive airway disease (OAD) known as asthma-COPD overlap (ACO) was described in 2015. In clinical practice, ACO is characterized by presenting features of both asthma and COPD and it is known to have more frequent and severe airflow obstruction, frequent hospitalization and medication usage than other OADs. Many population studies have shown that the prevalence of COPD and ACO is greater in females than in males. The underlying causes and sex differences of COPD and ACO are not fully understood. It is currently believed that both environmental and genetic factors play an important role.  However, large genome-wide association studies generally include limited or no information on environmental exposures.  The Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) has detailed information on many environmental exposures including smoking, pack-years and air pollution information, and also genotype information on more than 794,000 genetic variants for 9,896 individuals aged more than 45 years.  This large population study provides a unique opportunity to study the similarities and differences between males and females regarding the complex interplay between environmental and genetic risk factors associated with COPD and ACO, respectively.

However, it is still unclear how or why socioeconomic factors in childhood affect adolescent mental health, and under what circumstances this effect is most salient. Beyond the influences of parents on youth mental health are wider determinants that include policy regimes, income inequality, and national wealth. My research addresses this knowledge gap. 

Specifically, my objectives are to:
1) Examine the effect of childhood socioeconomic factors on adolescent mental health
2) Examine the moderating effect of gender and social support 
3) Test pathways that link childhood socioeconomic factors and adolescent mental health, such as family functioning
4) Profile high-risk groups based on economic and social circumstances.

I will use data from three national surveys (from the US, UK and Switzerland, respectively) that collected information on mental health of adolescents and income and social variables during their childhood. I propose to use these data to examine the effect of the socioeconomic environment during childhood on adolescent mental health. I will also use data from the Health Behaviours in School-aged Children study, a panel survey of 43 countries. With these datasets, I will compare different international socioeconomic settings and policies and their association with adolescent mental health. I will use advanced statistical methods to analyze the data. 

Ultimately, my goal is to elucidate the social and economic forces during childhood that shape mental health at adolescence, an understudied and formative stage of human development. Such knowledge is vital to public health for creating effective policies that promote socioeconomic equality and supportive environments for the mental health of youth."
Workshop to develop a national strategy on the integration of sleep and circadian rhythms into public health research and policies,"['Gariépy, Geneviève']","['Ayas, Najib', 'Boivin, Diane B', 'Carrier, Julie', 'Chaput, Jean-Philippe', 'Gosselin, Nadia', 'Gruber, Reut', 'Morin, Charles M', 'Pendharkar, Sachin R', 'Samuels, Charles H', 'Simonelli, Guido']","['Atypical Sleep Schedules', 'Cardiovascular Health', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Cognitive Health', 'Insomnia', 'Mental Health', 'Metabolic Health', 'Sleep', 'Sleep Apnea', 'Sleep In Children']",15000.0,404479,"Good sleep is important for everyone and shapes multiple aspects of health and behaviours. The human circadian rhythms - our internal biological clock - help regulate sleep and influences virtually all biological processes underlying health and illness. Yet, lack of sleep and disrupted circadian rhythms are so common in our society that they are essentially taken for granted. It is time that we integrate sleep and circadian health promotion into the Canadian public health discussion. 
We propose a 2-day national workshop that would bring together members of the sleep and circadian research community, researchers in public health, and relevant partners and stakeholders, with the goal of developing a national strategy for the integration of sleep and circadian rhythms into public health research and policies in Canada. The workshop will be organized around four target research and public health priorities including: 1) atypical working schedules; 2) sleep and circadian rhythm disruptions of children and adolescents; 3) insomnia; 4) sleep, circadian rhythms and cardiovascular and metabolic health. The aims of the workshop are to identify public health questions that the Canadian scientific community should prioritize, build the research capacity in public health research including programs and models of training and early career development, and develop public health strategies to inform the population and promote good sleep. In addition, a national strategic plan to integrate sleep and circadian rhythms into public health research and policies will be produced by the workshop's scientific committee and published on the Canadian Sleep and Circadian Network, the Canadian Sleep Society, and the Canadian Society for Chronobiology websites."

Notre projet de recherche-action participative concerne 5 MADA contrastés (contextes différents, milieux ruraux et urbains) dans la région de la Montérégie, au sud de Montréal, région qui connaîtra un vieillissement accéléré dans les vingt prochaines années. Dans une MADA, les balises de l'action s'appuient sur le vieillissement actif, un processus consistant à optimiser les possibilités de bonne santé, de participation et de sécurité afin d'accroître la qualité de vie pendant la vieillesse. Les actions concernent plusieurs sphères pouvant avoir un impact direct sur la santé des populations aînées (ex : habitat, inclusion sociale, services de santé). MADA est fondée sur la construction de liens sociaux, le dynamisme des communautés et leur mobilisation, au cœur du développement des communautés; qui constitue une stratégie privilégiée d'intervention pour l'équité en santé dans le domaine de la santé publique.
Dans une perspective d'équité en santé, la recherche participative présentée vise à comprendre l'action sur les déterminants sociaux de la santé (mécanismes), sur les caractéristiques du milieu (contexte) et sur les changements attendus (retombées), ce qui permettra d'élaborer un modèle d'action et des outils de transfert de connaissance.

Health Consequences of Gendered Economic Migration: The case of undocumented Latin American workers in Ontario,"['Gastaldo, Denise', 'Magalhaes, Lilian V']",['N/A'],"['Access To Health Care', 'Gender Differences', 'Health Promotion', 'Social Determinants Of Health', 'Undocumented Immigrant Workers', 'Working Conditions']",156897.0,171023,"Over the past 10 years, undocumented migration has been the fastest growing form of immigration worldwide.  In Canada, the largest concentration of undocumented workers is in Ontario, with current estimates of over 200,000 people. However, this population remains strikingly understudied in the scientific literature.  Both in Canada and internationally, health researchers have seldom focused on non-status workers despite the fact that they face multiple sources of oppression, often encounter multiple barriers or exclusion from health care services and frequently work in hazardous environments.  Therefore, the main goal of this study is to explore the health consequences of undocumented work in Ontario, focusing on the gender differences in terms of the effects of social exclusion and working conditions. Interviews and body mapping techniques will be used to collect data. The study is supported by community partners and an advisory board and intends to generate relevant knowldege to those serving these communities."

The intervention consists of deploying a public bicycle rental program called BIXI and is modeled after Vélib in Paris, France. BIXI will involve 2400 bicycles to be made available for self-service at minimal cost between April and November 2009 at 300 stations located primarily in the Ville-Marie, Plateau Mont-Royal, and Rosemont-Petite-Patrie boroughs of Montreal. The research project will address the following questions: (1) What are the socio-demographic, travel use, and health characteristics of BIXI users?; (2) What is the geography of BIXI use and to what extent do BIXI users travel along bike paths?; (3) What is level of risk of collision are BIXI users exposed to while traveling?; (4) What proportion of Montrealers have tried and regularly use BIXI? (5) How do Montrealers perceive BIXI? Active transportation is associated with health benefits including greater likelihood of meeting public health recommendations for physical activity, reduced body mass index, lower waist circumference, and improved blood lipid profiles. The contribution of increasing the accessibility of cycling for active transportation to physical activity objectives is not known nor are the potential negative impacts (e.g. trauma due to injuries) of the intervention."

Major works were undertaken to install drains and eliminate unhealthy housing, notably by prohibiting dwelling units in basements and windowless rooms. These efforts were very successful as infectious disease rates decreased and did so well before the advent of antibiotics. 

Initially in developed countries and now in developing nations, there have been major increases in chronic diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and several cancers. At the beginning of the 21st century, to counter these threats to population health, Public Health Departments have forged new alliances with major Canadian cities. Together, they are working to create environments that foster the supply of healthy and affordable food, enhance active transportation, and reduce the risks of bad housing conditions.

Our research program aims to study these cross-sector partnerships, which involve collaborations between health practitioners, municipalities, representatives from civil society, housing authorities, and actors from other sectors. We will study partnerships aimed at transforming built environments to increase the availability of fruit and vegetables, promote public transport and physical activity, and improve availability of affordable housing. We will also look into how these partnerships take into account social and gender inequalities and pay special attention to children and youth. To carry out these studies and make comparisons, we will rely on the active participation of the Directors of the Public Health Organizations in Montreal, Saskatoon, Toronto, and Vancouver. Ultimately, we will identify the factors that lead to success in forward-looking initiatives aimed at preventing the new epidemics of chronic diseases."
Evidence-based policy to help increase data sharing and improve hereditary cancer risk assessment,"['Geary, Janis D']",['N/A'],"['Case-Study', 'Data Governance', 'Data-Sharing', 'Hereditary Cancer', 'Knowledge Commons', 'Science Policy']",150000.0,441282,"Many aspects of our daily lives depend on vast amounts of data getting into the right hands, but we lack the evidence needed to create policies that actually result in data getting in the right hands. For example, in hereditary cancer risk assessment, there is often not enough data available to accurately determine the risk of cancer related to specific gene variants. Many companies who produce data on cancer gene variants treat that data as their own property and therefore do not share it, but still benefit from also accessing public data despite not contributing any. This is one example of the struggles between private and open approaches for governing knowledge-based resources like genetic data, with little evidence to inform which approaches should be supported through policy. My research will produce the evidence needed to help us develop policies for governance that achieve the intended goals of data sharing and use. The communities of users (scientists, clinicians, counselors, and the people contributing genomic variants) are diverse but share a common interest in using the best possible information to make very high stakes decisions, and to formulate policies to produce and govern a robust resource. Using multiple data sources, I will examine the data sharing and use over time and work with experts to develop polices based on this evidence. This work will improve our understanding of how to build effective governance of knowledge-based resources, and will specifically guide policy-development to support the provision and use of cancer genomic variants and improve how we test for hereditary cancer."

However, previous studies have not offered conclusive results on the health effects of greenness exposure. This may be related to the use of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a proxy for measuring green space. This index fails to effectively reflect access to greenness and thus may misclassify exposures. The health impacts of greenness accessibility are less known, particularly on children's respiratory health. That is an important knowledge gap as children's lung development is not complete until 5~8 years of age, a period when they spend increased time outdoors. The potential for inequality of spatial greenness accessibility to affect the development of asthma, allergic rhinitis, bronchitis, and bronchiolitis in children remains unclear. Our research team attends to leverage the Better Outcomes Registry and Network (BORN) via ICES and the CANUE databases to assess if better spatial greenness accessibility could reduce the risk of the four respiratory conditions onset in children aged 13 years and younger in Ontario. Findings from this study will provide evidence to better assess for whom and where health interventions should be targeted, which communities may benefit from more green space, and where communities may consider reducing infrastructure and traffic effects to minimize inequality in greenness access. Additionally, we propose a novel method that can provide a more precise measure for spatial greenness accessibility by travel time with regard to factors on road conditions, land use, geographic barriers, season, weather, air quality, and holidays to the nearest green space by the introduction of the Ontario Ministry of National Resource and Forestry (OMNRF) to the CANUE repository. Finally, the proposed study will pave a solid theoretical and data foundation for future studies in related areas."
Recommendations for culturally sensitive and intersectional practice in suicide prevention intervention for public safety personnel : a qualitative approach.,"['Genest, Christine']","['Bardon, Cécile', 'Clarkin, Chantalle L', 'Cramm, Heidi', 'Crawford, Allison', 'Geoffrion, Steve', 'Martin, Krystle', 'Ricciardelli, Rose']","['Cultural Sensibility', 'Intersectionality', 'Intervention', 'Public Safety Personnel', 'Qualitative Research', 'Suicide Prevention']",99970.0,488189,"Public safety personnel is a group of professionals particularly at risk of suicide. However, this is not a homogeneous group. In fact, this group of professionals includes all first responders, such as police officers, firefighters, correctional officers, paramedics and public safety communicators. Professional culture associate with those different occupations may be one of the factors explaining these differences between sub-groups. Considering these potential cultural differences, it would be relevant to adapt suicide prevention intervention to meet the needs of different professional subgroups, and to limit barriers to help-seeking.
One of the suicide prevention interventions to emerge from consultations with PSPs and work with the Quebec Ministry of Public Safety is the establishment of a crisis intervention line for public safety personnel, available 24/7. The creation of the RESPond line, specifically designed for PSP, is a direct response to this request. However, in order to tailor the intervention to the needs of different PSP sub-groups, it would be relevant to look at how the culture of different PSPs differs with regard to suicide and psychological distress. The aim of this project is therefore, 1) to identify cultural differences in suicide prevention between PSP sub-groups, with a view to intersectionality and 2) to adapt the crisis line intervention so that it is culturally sensitive. To meet these objectives, a two-stage qualitative design will be developed. 1) Focus groups with various sub-groups of PSPs, both French and English speaking, to find out how they view suicide their needs in terms of intervention and the barriers for seeking help. 2) Focus groups to present the results of the first phase, as well as clinical vignettes representing calls made to the crisis line, in order to adapt interventions culturally. Thematic analysis will be carried out at both stage. Recommendations for training and intervention will be developed and shared."
Kids Caring and Sharing: How Empathy for Pain and Sadness Affects Prosocial Behaviour,"['Gennis, Hannah G']",['N/A'],"['Children', 'Development', 'Empathy', 'Ics Travel Awards', 'Pain']",1000.0,324415,"Aim of investigation: There is evidence that children's empathy for pain develops differently than their empathy for sadness (Bandstra et al., 2011). Furthermore, children exposed to another child's sadness have shown increased prosocial behaviour compared to controls (Williams et al., 2014). The current study aimed to assess the differential effects of empathy for pain and sadness on children's prosocial behaviour. Methods: 77 children (Mage = 4.39 years, SD = 0.81) were randomly assigned to watch one of three videos: a girl in pain (pain induction), a girl who is sad (sadness induction), or a girl with a neutral emotion (control). Afterwards, participants rated pain (Faces Pain Scale - Revised; FPS-R) and affect (Facial Affective Scale; FAS) for themselves and the girl in the video. They then participated in a validated sticker-sharing task, choosing how many stickers they would keep for themselves and how many they would give to the girl in the video. Results: A one-way ANOVA revealed no significant difference in prosocial behaviour based on video exposure, F(2, 74) = 1.22, p = .302. Subsequent one-way ANOVAs revealed no differences in FAS ratings for self, F(2, 72) = 0.48, p = .620, and FPS-R ratings for self, F(2, 73) = 0.34, p = .712, based on video exposure. These analyses revealed that the emotion induction videos did not induce their appropriate emotion within participants. Conclusions: These findings suggest that exposing a young child to another child's pain or sadness did not differentially affect prosocial behaviour. The fact that participants exposed to another child's pain or sadness did not experience these emotions within themselves suggests a lack of empathy, and might explain the absence of prosocial behaviour. More research is needed in the study of pain-related empathy in children, and how this differs from empathy towards another child's sadness."
Do physiological stress responses contribute to metabolic dysfunction?,"['Gentile, Christina']",['N/A'],"['Age Differences', 'Metabolic Dysfunction', 'Physiological Reactivity', 'Prospective', 'Sex Differences', 'Stress']",17500.0,279566,"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide, killing an estimated 17 million people every year. The yearly economic burden of cardiovascular disease is approximately 22.2 billion dollars in Canada alone. Metabolic abnormalities incur significant risk for cardiovascular illnesses, particularly coronary artery disease. One out of 5 Canadians is affected by the metabolic syndrome (MS) over the lifespan. MS consists of at least three of the following five factors: central adiposity, high blood pressure, elevated triglycerides, increased fasting blood glucose, and low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. Psychological factors may contribute to MS via heightened or prolonged physiological responses to stress. Our objective is to examine the concurrent and prospective relations between a global index of metabolic dysfunction (MD) and stress responses, as well as the moderating effect of age and/or sex on these associations.  MD is defined as the number of MS parameters for which participants are in the higher quartile (lower for HDL) for their sex. A sample of 193 healthy working men and women were exposed to four stressor tasks while blood pressure, heart rate, and heart rate variability measures were obtained. Five-minute recovery periods followed each stressor. Residual change scores for stress reactivity (stress-baseline) and recovery (recovery-baseline) were used to control for baseline values. Three years later, MD was reassessed in 136 participants. Analyses will involve hierarchical linear regressions. This project will elucidate the importance of physiological stress responses to the development or progression of metabolic dysfunction, as well as highlight any sex and/or age differences in this regard."

Youth with mental disorders such as cannabis abuse and depression are less likely to attain adult life milestones. Our goal is to generate knowledge to improve the prevention of the social, personal and economic burdens of MHPs. Research on MHPs indicates that many MHPs have their roots in childhood and persist across the lifespan. The strongest environmental risk factor for MHPs in childhood is victimization (CV). The most common types of CV come from parents (eg,  neglect, abuse and exposure to domestic violence) and from peers (eg, bullying-victimization). While CV increases risk for MHPs, not all individuals exposed to CV will develop MHPs. Indeed, many victimized individuals may not develop MHPs or may initially develop symptoms and recover as adults. Conversely, MHPs may increase in severity for others. These differences might emerge during the transition into adulthood, because this period coincides with major changes in social roles and responsibilities. To better inform preventive interventions, we need to understand the reasons for the wide variations in MHPs responses to CV.  Our goals are (1) to characterize the trajectories of 5 MHPs including depression, anxiety, suicidality, cannabis use and mental health services use from ages 15 to 22 years among children exposed to different levels of CV and (2) to identify familial, social and lifestyle factors that can modify these trajectories. In order to do so, we will assess MHPs at age 22 years and collect complementary information on CV in a well-documented Canadian birth cohort assessed repeatedly since birth. Importance. This research will provide useful information on factors that can modify the course of MHPs in a critical period of life such as transitioning from adolescence into adulthood. Given this project will collect reliable data on MHPs in a Canadian cohort studied extensively since birth, the return on investment will be high."

A socially supportive and positive environment can help protect mental health and can be leveraged through intervention, but to what extent this applies in 2SLGBTQI+ youth is not clear. Further, patterns of healthcare usage for mental health problems in 2SLGBTQI+ youth are largely unknown but are essential for planning more effective services. Our objectives are fifth fold. First, we will document mental health in 23-year-olds who self-identified as being attracted to same-sex partners at least some of the time. Second, we will capture trajectories of childhood depressive symptoms and suicidality to gain a better understanding of onset and evolution of their symptoms Third, we will determine their use of medical services for mental health issues. Fourth, we will examine whether social support was received and reduced mental health problems. This will help the roll-out of preventive services in the future. Fifth, we will see if there are any differences between those born male and those born female. We will accomplish these goals using the existing Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development, an ongoing population-based study of 2120 participants born in many areas of Quebec, Canada, in 1997-98. About 1500 participants provided information on their sexual attraction and orientation, state of mental health, and support received. Linking this data to Quebec healthcare databases gives a snapshot of the use of medical services with time. Our study will provide a comprehensive portrait of mental health in 2SLGBTQI+ young people in Canada to better understand problems and to plan for more effective services.

Preliminary studies suggest that COVID-19 causes long-term lung damage, even in young, otherwise healthy people who did not need to go to hospital or the ICU. In recent months, new COVID-19 variants - of which little is known - have become more common and it is not known how they will affect the long-term health of people's lungs.
We are a group of respiratory researchers, patients, health care workers, non-profit groups and others who want to know how common long-term lung damage after COVID-19 is, who is most affected by it and what the effects of this damage are on other important aspects of people's lives.
We plan to study a large sample of people with COVID-19 from across Canada-some who needed hospitalization but most who did not. Through telephone questionnaires, we will determine their respiratory symptoms, quality of life and medical history. Then we will invite them to one of our eight Canadian testing centres to have special, thorough breathing tests. 
The information we learn about the effect of COVID-19 on the lungs will help patients and health care providers manage it better. It will also reveal how different COVID-19 variants affect the lungs. We will use this new knowledge to write a formal guide on what respiratory monitoring and testing should be done after COVID-19 infection. This will ensure that people affected by COVID-19 get the care they need to maintain their lung health. This will also help prevent unnecessary testing which places extra strain on the health care system and delay care for other patients."

I will continue to build on a strong foundation of research and integrated knowledge translation capacity provincially, nationally and internationally to have the greatest impact through three program objectives: 1. To develop predictive risk models (e.g., functional, physiological, psychosocial, biomechanical, sport, gender) for youth S&R injuries and their consequences (e.g., osteoarthritis) to inform the development prevention strategies in a diversity of youth settings where there are research gaps and potential for significant population health impact (e.g., school, rural, disabled community). 2. To evaluate the implementation, effectiveness, and sustainability of individually targeted and population based injury prevention strategies (e.g., rules, policy, exercise and technical training, equipment), using novel evaluation technologies (e.g., surveillance based Apps, accelerometers, remote technologies), to reduce the burden of youth S&R injuries and their consequence. 3. To develop, implement and evaluate secondary prevention strategies to reduce the burden of youth injury consequences (e.g., osteoarthritis, post-concussion syndrome) in all Canadian youth. A significant paradigm shift from the current approach of managing health, away from treatment and towards prevention, is critical.

Building on previous work that combines novel theoretical insights and methods to examine how children move, learn and play in relation to the physical environment, this study will provide new knowledge about the relationships between cognition and movement. Drawing on philosophical concepts and an innovative, artistic-scientific methodology, the proposed project will illuminate previously unknown connections between movement, neurological processes and physical environments. This knowledge could be used to optimize the design of integrated classrooms and movement interventions that enhance all children's physical, social and cognitive development in these and other play spaces."

It is also an important goal and core value of public health policy, research, and practice.  However, as research teams explore the potential of AI for public health, they are facing questions about what 'equitable AI' means in practice for their research activities. For example, there may be competing conceptions of equity (e.g., equal outcomes vs. equal access) and different AI methods may lead to different equity-related outputs. As a result, it is not always clear where research teams focus their efforts or how emerging research programs should plan and set priorities to advance health and social equity in population and public health.  To bridge this gap, the Collaboration on AI for the Public's Health-a partnership of the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto, Public Health Ontario, and the Vector Institute-is proposing a researcher-engaged planning process to inform the design of a program of research on equitable AI for population and public health. The goals of this planning initiative are to:
1.Synthesize what is currently known about equity-informed AI research methods and practices for population and public health;
2.Engage local research teams who are using AI methods in population and public health research to clarify the equity issues and questions they are facing in the design and/or conduct of the research, to canvas the practical steps they are taking to address these issues and questions, and to gain insight into the knowledge or practice gaps they may be encountering in the process ('equitable AI learning cases');
3.Convene a collaborative planning workshop to review the preliminary synthesis, consolidate lessons learned from the 'equitable AI learning cases', identify critical knowledge gaps, and set research priorities based on these gaps."

They documented Tlicho knowledge of STIs and HIV, risk behaviours, cultural strengths, resilience factors, and the status of available prevention initiatives and educational materials. This proposal builds on the underused baseline study to develop an evidence-based, resilience-focused, action-oriented knowledge translation (KT) strategy to socialize the findings from the community-based research. A follow-up survey will then evaluate the impact of this strategy on HIV/STI risk. The project creates expertise within the TCSA for sustainable evidence-based prevention of HIV/STIs, building upon and expanding the training of Tlicho CBRs. The project implements an evidence-based KT strategy, evaluates its impact, and produces a longer term proposal to monitor HIV and STIs among the Tlicho. The project consolidates the partnership between the TCSA and CIET -- recognised with a Northwest Territories Premier's Award in June 2008 - to build research capacities."

These bacteria provide a broad range of 'services' to humans, including producing nutrients and metabolites that are essential to human life. Infants begin to acquire a gut microbiome at birth, and there is strong animal evidence that lack of exposure to 'healthy' bacteria at the right times in development results in social, behavioral, and emotional problems. But studies that track the co-development of the gut microbiome and children's socioemotional problems have not been done. It is important to do these studies because we need to understand the role that gut bacteria play in order to promote healthy child development. We propose to collect stool samples and measure children's socioemotional development over the first 4 years of life and then examine how the changes in the gut microbiome relate to changes in socioemotional problems. We will also study the effects of exposure to prenatal stress because it can disrupt healthy development in children and because we believe that one way it may do so is through disrupting the early life microbiome. We have already collected stool samples and measures of socioemotional problems at 3-, 12-, and 24-months of age in 552 children. We plan to follow up at 36- and 48-months so that we can examine how changes in the microbiome relate to changes in children's socioemotional problems and learn what role prenatal stress might play in disrupting healthy development. This work is important because children's mental health problems are one of the most costly and debilitating health problems around the globe, and we need to find new ways to prevent the growing tide of mental health problems. By studying the gut microbiome, we believe we will discover new clues to the ways that mental health problems get started in the first few years of life and new intervention targets that we can test in future studies."

As society ages, increased occurrences of multimorbidity is a challenge for health service providers. Multimorbidity is influenced by the conditions in which people grow, age, work and live. These conditions, also considered risk factors, are referred to as the social determinants of health. Existing research has focused on a single risk factor for a single disease. It is important to develop new methods to study multimorbidity, to account for the combined influence 
between the risk factors. By applying novel research methodology, I will develop a risk metric to characterize the combined influence of the social determinants of health. I will evaluate the effect of the social risk metric on the development of chronic conditions and multimorbidity. I will then use the risk metric to demonstrate the long-term impact of policy intervention which targets the social determinants of health on the development of multimorbidity. Understanding the combined influence of the social determinants of health will help identify individuals at risk of developing multimorbidity. Developing a simulation model to demonstrate the effect of policy interventions will assist in policy development and enable improved cross-government collaboration for chronic disease prevention."

These skills--called ""health literacy"" skills--can be challenging to apply as complex new information about HIV prevention strategies emerges (e.g. reduced risk of transmission from HIV treatments) and due to the plethora of information available via digital media (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, websites and mobile apps). This is particularly important for gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) given the high rates of HIV infection in this population. Clinicians and health agencies interacting with MSM also have a tough time navigating this new landscape, and there are different social, cultural and legal perspectives on HIV risk. Research in this area is only beginning, and there is a pressing need for effective interventions to improve health literacy for MSM.

We aim to bring together Canadian and international researchers, knowledge users, and policy-makers in health literacy, risk communication, HIV prevention and gay men's health to meet over two days in Vancouver in 2014. Our goal is to build an interdisciplinary team to collaboratively develop a national and international program of research and identify projects to better understand the relationship between health literacy and HIV prevention for MSM (at the individual, provider and society levels). By integrating this meeting within the BC Gay Men's Health Summit, we aim to discuss, share information, and learn from a wide range of community members, service providers, policy-makers and researchers in this area to identify the most important research questions to fill critical knowledge gaps, which will lead to effective health literacy interventions. By increasing the health literacy skills of MSM and their providers we can improve the understanding and appropriate use of effective HIV prevention strategies to reduce HIV among MSM."

Data will be drawn from the National Population Health Survey, which collects information every two years on health conditions, health behaviours and labour market participation from a representative longitudinal sample of Canadians. The knowledge gained through this work will help orienting primary prevention approaches for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases with respect to the work environment and health behaviours and will inform whether these approaches need to specific to men and women."

Given the variability and unique nature of an individual's exposome, it offers a promising approach for understanding underlying population level disparities in chronic disease outcomes. As a strategy to interpret the complex relationships between environment, behavior, genetics, and disease phenotypes epidemiological studies have recently begun to integrate the exposome concept as a workable approach. However, epidemiological studies have largely relied on standardized questionnaires, which are prone to error due to cultural factors, social desirability and recall biases.  As a result, this work will comprehensively screen for an expansive collection of both known and novel metabolites in multiple biofluids including urine and serum amongst a diverse, international population, representative of distinctive ethnic, cultural, social, and regional settings from the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study. Upon screening we will be able to elucidate specific types of exposures (ex. diet, air pollution) associated with elevated disease risk in different socio-economic regions. For the purposes of clinical translation, specific biomarker-disease risk relationships will be assessed in the context of the exposome using multi-omic data (genomic, proteomic, metabolomic) and bioinformatic tools. This will allow for the identification of novel causal biomarkers of disease which are urgently needed for clinical practice to identify high risk patients and to monitor treatment practices. Thus, the proposed work will facilitate the understanding of environmental risk factors in distinct vulnerable regions around the world, in addition to aiding in the identification of causal biomarker-disease relationships for more personalized, preventative techniques for disease intervention."

Researchers and policymakers have been looking for ways to increase physical activity levels of Canadian children.  The Child & Youth Network and partners in London, Ontario have introduced a program which will offer every Grade 5 child in London a free pass to various physical activity facilities and programs throughout the city. Our primary goal is to evaluate whether or not this program is effective at increasing physical activity levels of children.   We will use a combination of approaches in this study.  We will use data gathered from a series of child and parent surveys to look at how effective the pass intervention is at increasing physical activity levels of children while having the pass, and 4 and 12 months after the pass ends. We will also investigate which subgroups of children (for example, females, new immigrants, children from low income households) benefit most from receiving the pass.  Understanding who benefits from the pass (and who does not), can provide researchers and community partners with information on how to develop more effective programs for improving children's health in the future. An important element of this study is the engagement of different knowledge user groups at all stages. We believe this study will provide a model for future community studies."

Our Primary Objective is to assess whether this app is effective at changing knowledge of healthy food and healthy eating behaviours among youth in a full range of urban, suburban and rural settings across Southwestern Ontario. We will monitor progress in three ways. First, participation with the app will be tracked using web analytics software. Second, surveys including dietary recall and food behaviour questionnaires will be administered online to all participants before and after they use the app for a 12-week period. Third, we will conduct focus groups with participants to gain insight into their experiences using the app to enhance the product for future versions. We will also be considering how low-income youth and youth at risk for health issues (e.g. diabetes or obesity) benefit from using the app. This will provide a model on how to use smartphone technology for promoting healthier diets and behaviours."

Active school travel contributes to children's overall physical activity. Given that stemming increasing chronic disease rates is a priority in the Canadian healthcare system, we propose an innovative school-based transportation intervention to build lifelong healthy physical activity habits. A partnership in the St. Thomas-Elgin, Middlesex-London, and Oxford region runs a School Travel Planning (STP) program, which encourages children to use active school travel. We propose to leverage this existing STP program that uses a combination of engineering changes to school neighbourhoods to make it easier to use active modes, education to increase knowledge on how to be safe using active travel, encouragement of active travel, and enforcement to ensure people traveling through the neighbourhood follow the laws of the road. This project will examine how the STP program can improve active school travel, physical activity levels, and reduce air pollution around schools. Students and parents from grades 4-6 at 24 schools will be involved in this study. Twelve schools will receive the intervention, while the other twelve will be used as control schools. The project will use air pollution monitors, parent and child surveys, Global Positioning System tracking devices, physical activity trackers, and self-reported trip diaries to collect data. We will compare changes over time in travel mode choice, physical activity levels, and air pollution between intervention and control schools. We hypothesize that students attending schools involved in the STP program will use more active travel modes, be more active, and have better air quality around school. This research will contribute to improving the effectiveness of STP programs for improving child health across Canada."

The goal of this research is to work with community-based agencies to understand the lived experiences of IRNW-PHAs through focus groups and individual interviews. We will then work collaboratively to develop a model of HIV health literacy, incorporating the feedback of IRNW-PHAs and representatives of community-based agencies providing care and services to these women.  Following the recommendations of previous community-based research, ""Silent Voices of the HIV-AIDS Epidemic: African and Caribbean Women in Toronto 2002-2004"", the research will address skills-building training initiatives around treatment literacy, leadership, problem solving, peer support, employment seeking, and services access advocacy, as well as life-skills training and skill building around disclosure. The social determinants of health (income and social status, social support networks, education, employment conditions, coping skills, and gender) will also be evaluated for their contribution to health literacy and serve as an analytic framework for the research. In addition, there will be a focus on examining unique, often neglected factors related to immigrant women such as cultural and religious values, acculturation, trauma, experiences of social exclusion, and related psychological and psycho-social factors. The resulting recommendations and model will assist community-based agencies to assess HIV health literacy and will empower them to develop strategies to enhance the HIV health literacy of their IRNW-PHA clients."

Our communities are often labelled 'sick' or 'perverted.' Historically Western medical research has contributed to the stigmatization of our people and supported public policies that institutionalized discrimination against us.  For instance, in Canada homosexuality was illegal until 1969.  Gay marriage has only been possible for five years.  And people who identify as trans are still labelled as 'mentally ill' according to the guidelines for psychiatric diagnoses.  

Most current research into LGBT health no longer views our sexual orientation or gender identity as something to be cured; rather progressive research sees LGBT people as a subculture of diverse people with our own unique values, mores and cultural practices.  However current research has clearly demonstrated that our communities suffer from higher rates of mental illness than the heterosexual majority.   For instance, in Canada, we know that LGB people report higher rates of mood and anxiety disorders, poorer mental health status, and higher rates of lifetime suicidality compared to heterosexuals.  Much of the current research on mental health suggests that our higher rates of mental illness stem from the level of discrimination and social marginalization that we face due to our sexual orientation and gender identity. 

Our Cafe Scientifique will explore what current research says about the mental health of our communities, and how this has an impact on the mental health care we receive, mental health policy in Ontario, and societal perceptions of our communities.  We will explore how we can create an ethical LGBT mental health research agenda, without contributing to the further stigmatization of our communities."

The evidence to support specific dietary strategies is limited, and current dietary advice relies largely on evidence from small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of risk factors, and prospective cohort studies that are based on self-reported diet and cannot provide cause-and-effect relationships. Innovative nutrition research is needed that can replace the evidence from traditional large clinical outcomes trials at a much lower cost. Metabolomics is an emerging field in nutrition and chronic disease epidemiology. This approach uses the products of overall metabolism to develop an objective metabolic signature for a dietary pattern, which is not subject to the same measurement and reporting errors of traditional self-report dietary tools. This approach can also be used to produce an inferred genetic signature for Mendelian randomization, which allows for the assessment of causal relations. Through this project, I will work with the Portfolio Diet, a plant-based dietary portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods (nuts, plant-protein, sticky fibre, plant sterols, and heart-healthy oils), to include this new transformative approach. The primary aim of this project is to determine a metabolic signature of the Portfolio Diet from past and ongoing RCTs of the diet. The secondary objective is to apply and compare this metabolic signature to 3 large U.S. cohorts (the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professional Follow-up Study) and assess the relation of the Portfolio Diet, its metabolic signature, and inferred genetic signature with heart disease and diabetes. This approach will be an innovative technique that will advance the field of nutrition epidemiology. Heart disease and diabetes are very common in Canada and worldwide, therefore, research like this project that aims to identify dietary patterns to prevent these diseases could impact millions of people."

The study contributes an experiential, contextual layer of knowledge to ISIS that will strengthen the overall research program. The findings will highlight the relationship between smoking, social inequalities and place within individual experiences and provide insight into possible, place-based strategies to reduce inequalities in health (particularly related to smoking) among populations most vulnerable."
A prospective study of the impact of fear-avoidance variables and anxiety sensitivity on genital pain and sexual impairment after childbirth.,"['Glowacka, Maria M']",['N/A'],"['Anxiety Sensitivity', 'Fear-Avoidance Model Of Pain', 'Genital Pain', 'Postpartum Pain', 'Prospective Study', ""Women'S Health""]",17500.0,279048,"Chronic pain problems involving the female reproductive system are major health concerns and entail a great personal cost to affected women and their families since they are poorly understood and often ignored. One such condition is genital pain that develops after childbirth. The majority of women resume regular intercourse by three months postpartum, and about half experience it as painful. Under treated genital pain is a risk factor for developing chronic pain. According to the fear-avoidance model of pain, a woman may interpret pain as threatening leading to a fear of pain, anxiety, and excessive attention to the pain. Consequently, the woman avoids the painful activity, further strengthening the interpretation of the pain as threatening. Extensions of this model suggest that a higher fear of anxiety-related body sensations (anxiety sensitivity) may lead to excessive fear-avoidance. This model has been partially supported in a retrospective study of women with chronic genital pain. However, women from this study were previously diagnosed with genital pain and the study did not include anxiety sensitivity so the influence of fear-avoidance on the development of the pain could not be examined. The aim of the proposed study is to examine whether greater fear-avoidance and anxiety sensitivity in pregnancy predict the onset and severity of genital pain and decreased sexual functioning postpartum. First time mothers will complete measures of fear-avoidance and anxiety sensitivity during pregnancy, and measures of genital pain intensity and sexual functioning three months after childbirth. Results may identify women at greater risk for this condition and inform the development of interventions, which may lower genital pain intensity, improve sexual functioning, and reduce the risk of developing chronic pain. Findings could thus improve the health and quality of life of many women, since postpartum genital pain is a highly prevalent but neglected women's health problem."

About one quarter of Canadian youth aged 15–24 reported using cannabis in 2013. Epidemiological studies and translational studies in Dr Gobbi's lab have confirmed that cannabis consumption at a young age is associated with a higher risk of depression and anxiety in adulthood, even after controlling for confounding factors. Many confirmatory longitudinal epidemiological studies have been published on this subject, but systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating the global risk of depression after adolescent cannabis consumption have not been performed, nor communicated to Canadian youth, educators, and families.Theoverall aimof this knowledge synthesis proposal is to systematically review and carry out a meta-analysis about the epidemiological studies published in the last 20 years regarding the long-term effects of adolescent cannabis use on the risk of developing mood-related disorders and to communicate this knowledge to our community.Theprincipal applicantis Dr. Gabriella Gobbi, psychiatrist and neuroscientist at McGill University, world-renowned expert in mood disorders and the cannabinoid system.

Survivors may experience a variety of traumatic events in childhood (neglect, physical, psychological, or sexual abuse, bullying, exposure to domestic violence) and adulthood (revictimization, assault, intimate partner violence). Beginning in childhood and extending across the lifespan, men are more likely than women to experience violence inside and outside the home. Although sexual victimization is more prevalent in women, men are less likely to disclose victimization, thus depriving themselves of health services. Consequently, untreated effects of violence may contribute to the greater health difficulties found in men. Despite an extensive literature relating interpersonal violence to a broad variety of health problems, the precise mechanisms linking violence and the development of health issues remain largely unknown. By what process might exposure to violence lead to health problems in men? How does sex and gender contribute to these outcomes? What bio-psycho-social factors explain the health effects of violence among men and boys? What predicts positive adaptation and resilience among survivors? Building on our previous and current research, we plan to produce a detailed review of the literature and to organize meetings to foster collaborations among researchers from different scholarly domains and universities, identify key research priorities, and provide knowledge translation on the health-related effects and treatment of interpersonal violence in men and boys. This planning grant not only seeks to identify current knowledge gaps in Canadian research, but will also set the stage for the development of ongoing research collaborations that guide health services offered to male survivors."

Cette maladie touche environ 1 adulte sur 5 au Canada et a de sérieux impacts sur le bien-être physique et émotionnel, le sommeil, la vie de famille et le travail. Cette condition coûte également très cher, tant pour les personnes qui vivent avec cette condition que pour notre système de santé publique. Malheureusement, la douleur chronique demeure sous-rapportée, peu reconnue, sous-diagnostiquée et fréquemment traitée de façon inadéquate. Afin de viser une gestion optimale, on suggère d'utiliser une combinaison de traitements pharmacologiques (médicaments) et non pharmacologiques (exercice, psychothérapie, yoga). L'efficacité de ces traitements peut être influencée par plusieurs facteurs et les dimensions biologiques, psychologiques et sociales sont essentielles à considérer. Par exemple, le sexe et le genre font partie des dimensions pertinentes à examiner. Le sexe fait référence à un ensemble de caractéristiques biologiques (anatomie, hormones) alors que le genre est plutôt une caractéristique sociale (rôles, comportements et expressions des gens qui influencent leur façon d'agir en société). Ainsi, mon projet de doctorat aura pour objectif de mesurer les associations entre le sexe, le genre, l'usage des traitements (pharmacologiques et non pharmacologiques) ainsi que l'usage de soins de santé. En plus de constituer un élément important dans la compréhension des traitements et la promotion d'un usage optimal (traitements plus efficaces et personnalisés), l'étude du sexe et du genre est  pertinente en vue de déceler la présence d'inégalités en termes de soins de santé. Ainsi, nos résultats permettront de sensibiliser les cliniciennes, cliniciens et décisionnaires et d'orienter les solutions pour améliorer la prestation des soins en plus de promouvoir une science plus rigoureuse, égalitaire et inclusive."

However, at the other end of the spectrum, many of those aged 80 and over are healthy, active, and alert with very few chronic medical problems,few or no ongoing medications, and living independently without assistance. What is different between these two groups now? What was different about their life's circumstances and  experiences that might have contributed to their current situation?

Birthing Relationships and Rural Health Practices: The Experiences of Queer Women and Their Perinatal Care Providers.,"['Goldberg, Lisa S', 'Aston, Megan L']","['Burrow, Sylvia', 'Guptill, Elizabeth', 'Simmonds, Anne H']","['Diverse Populations', 'Gender/Sexuality', 'Health Equity', 'Inter-Professional Research', 'Lgbttqq Research', 'Phenomenological/Qualitative Methods', 'Provider-Consumer Relationships', 'Queer Birthing Women', 'Rural Health Care', 'Social Exclusion']",100000.0,259461,"Queer birthing women experience social exclusion in the Canadian health system based on gender and sexual orientation. Yet little research has been conducted on the experiences of these women, even less in rural care.  Homophobia, heterosexism and intolerance continue to be embedded in health care structures that are invisible and not well understood by perinatal providers. Heterosexist language and resources are especially pervasive outside of urban centers creating social and institutional conditions of exclusion. Likewise, providers often lack the necessary education to work productively with queer women during birth. Although providers often approach birthing with the intent of doing good, taking up a position of neutrality or attempting to treat everyone the same leaves providers ill equipped to account for the ways in which social conditions impact the birth experiences of queer women in rural life. 

Providers working with birthing women may unknowingly reinstate normative patterns resulting in homophobia and gender binaries. This is particularly salient in birthing contexts, where the standards of care have been heteronormatively constructed. There is an urgency to understand how perinatal practices contribute to health inequities in the lives of birthing women who are queer, in addition to the ways certain providers may challenge those patterns to maximize rural birthing care.

This phenomenological study will examine how queer women experience birth across six rural sites in Nova Scotia, and how rural providers experience their work with queer birthing women.  A total of 25-30 queer women, 15-20 nurses, 15-20 physicians, and 4-5 midwives will participate in interviews and focus groups. Findings from the study will articulate strategies for optimizing perinatal care in the context of social exclusion. The results will be useful for best practice guidelines and continuing education for providers working with queer birthing women in rural care"

Yet we have inadequate explanations for how exactly social exclusion determines health outcomes. LBTQ women may engage in behaviours that are detrimental to health, to some extent in response to intolerance. They are less likely to seek out health care services, in part because many experience health care as discriminatory. Furthermore, primary care providers frequently lack adequate training for working effectively with queer women. Even with the best of intentions, practicing from a position of presumed neutrality may leave providers woefully unable to take into account the ways in which social conditions influence the lives and health of queer women. 

Everyday health care practices and ways of relating with patients, at individual and institutional levels, may unintentionally reproduce patterns of heterosexism, homophobia and intolerance for gender ambiguity. We need to better understand how health care practices and relationships may unwittingly contribute to health inequities for LBTQ women, as well as how some health care providers challenge those patterns to optimize care. 

This phenomenological study will examine how queer women in two Canadian cities (Halifax and Vancouver) experience health care, as well as how primary care providers experience their work with queer women. In each site 20-25 women, 15-20 nurses and 15-20 general practice physicians will participate in one-on-one interviews and focus groups. Findings from the proposed study will help to identify strategies for effective health care in the context of social exclusion. It will explicate ways in which routine practices - individual and/or institutional - may reproduce social exclusion for LBTQ women, contributing to health disadvantages.

The ultrafines, which are about 1/600th the diameter of a human hair, are produced mostly from the burning of fossil fuels, such as oil and diesel. They are present in the air in both urban and rural environments. Because of their small size people can breathe them in.
There is little known about the health effects of ultrafines. We will study whether these ultrafines can cause cardiopulmonary disease and whether we can identify how these particles affect people's health biologically and genetically.
We will investigate whether people exposed to higher levels of ultrafines in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver are at higher risk of developing cardiopulmonary disease. We are also going to collect ultrafines in air in Montreal and from a diesel laboratory to determine what the physical and chemical properties of these particles are. These particles will then be sent to our biology laboratories so we can determine how they may affect the biological and genetic characteristics of human cells and whether they impact the cardiopulmonary health of mice.
This project will help our understanding of the role of ultrafines on the development of chronic cardiorespiratory disease. For example, we may identify a genetic signature that could tell us who maybe at higher risk. We may also find a way to treat or prevent negative health effects in individuals garnered from information on our biological assessments. This information can also be used in developing regulations and other policy frameworks that would reduce levels in the air. The net outcome of this research program would be the effective reduction of chronic cardiopulmonary disease in Canadians exposed to very small particles in air."

The most common mental disorders, including major depression and conduct disorders show a peak age of onset in later childhood and adolescence thus derailing the quality of life and productivity of individuals over entire lifetimes. However, by identifying at risk children at an early age we have an opportunity to intervene and prevent many of such mental disorders. The challenge is in effectively identifying truly vulnerable children to be able to intervene in a timely manner.  Current programs for identifying at risk children are constructed on evidence linking early life adversity, such as poverty or birth outcomes, and the risk for mental illness.  These factors predict mental illness at the level of the population, but are inefficient at the level of the individual due to the considerable variability in outcomes: many children born early, small, or into poverty are healthy and productive. The goal of this project is to identify robust and predictive biological and psychological measurements that help to predict which children are at risk early on. In particular, by assaying molecular markers that capture the biological mechanisms associated with specific psychiatric outcomes, we will identify factors that differentiate those who do and do not succumb to childhood mental illness given the same set of known early life risk factors. This study will thus inform targeted, and personalized interventions aimed at both reducing the severity of onset of these disorders and the negative outcomes that accompany them, such as suicide and substance abuse."

Yet, little is known regarding how migration patterns and experiences impact transmission, risk, and prevention of these infections in high-income settings such as Canada. Women in sex work often face high prevalence of HIV/STIs and are highly mobile, yet little is known regarding the ways in which migration patterns influence health outcomes and access to care for migrant sex workers. In Canada, as in other settings, migration patterns generally relate to unequal social and economic opportunities, which attract women from other countries, provinces, and communities to urban areas such as Metropolitan Vancouver. Among women of Aboriginal (First Nations, Inuit, and Métis) ancestry, migration between Northern BC and Vancouver is embedded within a legacy of colonization and racialized policies, yet has received little attention in relation to HIV or HCV. Despite efforts to scale-up access to the continuum of care in BC (e.g., the STOP HIV/AIDS program), migrants, sex workers, and populations of Aboriginal ancestry remain disproportionately impacted by HIV, STIs and HCV. This research is investigating how migration influences HIV, STI and HCV risks and prevention among sex workers (e.g., exposure to new working conditions, violence). Based on a cohort study of 1000 female sex workers in Vancouver, including 600 non-migrants and 400 migrants, the research described in this application is evaluating and informing policies and programs to improve the health of migrant sex workers, including international migrants as well as internal migrants who move within Canadian or provincial borders. It will establish a broader program of innovative research and training in Migration and Global Sexual Health to facilitate comparative work with marginalized migrant women across international settings, including Canada, Mexico and Central America, and elsewhere."

Whereas most STBBI prevention, treatment, and care interventions continue to focus on individual and behavioural factors, evidence suggests a critical need for interventions that also address broader structural factors such as law/policy, stigma, and labour conditions. In Metro Vancouver, BC, several innovative structural and community-led interventions are currently being rolled out, including peer-based HIV/STI testing; community empowerment initiatives (eg, anti-stigma, sensitivity trainings, peer outreach); and changes in policing practices and policies in some policing jurisdictions. Understanding the impacts of these currently unfolding interventions on STBBIs is directly aligned with the 2018 Pan Canadian Framework for Action on STBBIs. The proposed five-year study aims to understand the impacts of new peer-to-peer HIV/STI testing, community empowerment interventions (eg, anti-stigma sensitivity trainings, peer outreach) and changes in policing policies and practices on STBBI risk environments (e.g., condom use, drug use), violence, and HIV/STI incidence among sex workers over time.

To meet these aims, we seek to build on the unique infrastructure provided by the AESHA project, one of the largest and longest running prospective cohorts of sex workers in North America. Participants will complete semi-annual surveys and STBBI testing; we will also use linked provincial administrative data (e.g., HIV, policing, mortality, health service utilization) to provide unbiased measures of key variables. Amidst continued syndemics of STBBIs and violence faced by sex workers, this study offers an unprecedented opportunity to inform new strategies to improve the health of marginalized women in Canada and globally."

While some optimism is justified by the promise of vaccines, the extent of the optimism is not yet warranted. Apart from the risks associated with COVID-19 variants, vaccine hesitancy remains a profound challenge to public health. Reducing vaccine hesitancy is likely to require different approaches for different communities, but we do not have a sufficiently nuanced understanding of differences in vaccine attitudes across the country. First- and second-generation immigrants constitute nearly 40% of the Canadian population, but we have inadequate data about vaccine hesitancy in immigrant groups or data about the differences in immigrant communities as a function of generational status, ethnicity, or sex. A deeper and more nuanced picture of vaccine hesitancy in immigrants is thus essential to ending the pandemic. Vaccine hesitancy has traditionally been characterized as a consequence of the ""war on science,"" including the ""death of expertise."" There is considerable evidence, however, that this view is mistaken. Vaccine hesitancy actually reflects a crisis of trust, but we know very little about the attitudes of immigrants regarding public institutions or about the effect of differences of generational status, ethnicity, or sex on these attitudes. Improving vaccine uptake in Canada will not be achieved by giving Canadians a reason to believe in public health messaging regarding COVID-19 but by giving them a reason to trust the messengers, and a successful public health approach will require targeting messaging to match the attitudes of a particular community. The question of how to do that for diverse immigrant communities is the focus of this project."

From this work, the Opioid Surveillance Steering Committee, led by COO and comprised of First Nations community members and Elders, identified several essential research questions to better understand this health crisis. 

This research program will leverage novel database linkages at ICES to characterize the real-world patterns and trends of opioid use and related harm, pathways of healthcare use, and treatment outcomes among First Nations people who use opioids. Further, it will bring together community and research expertise through joint leadership by COO and the ODPRN. This will also support an integrated knowledge translation approach to research conduct and dissemination through community engagement, direct liaisons between the research team and communities, and broad dissemination of research products tailored to various stakeholders at the community and policy-level. 

Rates of opioid-related harm in Ontario are among the highest in the country and First Nations people are disproportionately experiencing the effects.

As one example of the inequities SGM individuals experience, the impacts of COVID-19 on physical and mental health have been greater for the SGM community compared to the general population. Given that the impacts of the pandemic also have been severe for immunocompromised patients, it is likely that immunocompromised SGM patients have been severely and uniquely affected.  

Immunocompromised patients have an urgent need for accurate and up-to-date information during a pandemic. Transplant patients have expressed that information provided by governments, public health authorities, transplant centres, and health professionals can be difficult to find, fragmented, inconsistent, and conflicting. For immunocompromised SGM patients, inadequate communication of health information may represent a double dose of stress, anxiety, and stigmatization within their communities, and directly contribute to poorer health outcomes.  

We will conduct a series of activities that will inform our team's research planning and build the needed partnerships to address health inequities among SGM transplant recipients: (1) a pan-Canadian environmental scan of transplant programs to determine how they collect and use SGM sociodemographic data; (2) explore the perspectives of Canadian SGM transplant patients on their interactions with their transplant centre and the health information they receive; (3) build partnerships with community groups focused on SGM health. This work will lay the groundwork to plan the research needed for improved alignment between SGM transplant patient needs and transplant program practices, ultimately enabling transplant health care providers to more effectively serve their SGM patients."

It is proposed that exposure to severe or long-term stress during childhood may alter the function of the biological systems, thereby leading to poor health outcomes. Our project will examine the potential biological pathways through which childhood adversity leads to development of several chronic diseases within the same individual. Assessing the biomarkers across different biological systems will help us understand the burden that childhood adversity places on our body and allow us to assess the risk for development of multiple diseases. Understanding whether childhood adversity is associated with increased risk for development of more than one chronic disease will also allow us to identify at risk individuals earlier so that appropriate interventions, which could be treatments and/or lifestyle changes can be implemented to decrease the risk of disease and untimely death."
Using metabolomics to gain insight into the link between adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) and multimorbidity in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA),"['Gonzalez, Andrea', 'Joshi, Divya']","['Pigeyre, Marie', 'Raina, Parminder S']","['Adverse Childhood Experiences', 'Aging', 'Metabolomic Age', 'Metabolomics', 'Multimorbidity']",67000.0,481309,"Multimorbidity is defined as the presence of two or more chronic health conditions within the same individual. Multimorbidity is associated with loneliness, reduced social participation, functional disability, poor quality of life, and premature death. Therefore, prevention and management of multimorbidity is a priority for healthcare systems in many countries. However, little is known about the causes and risk factors of multimorbidity, how it progresses, and the best options for prevention and treatment. It is suggested that accumulation of risk factors and adversities over time may increase the risk of multimorbidity. One such risk factor is early life adversity, which includes exposure to traumatic experiences during childhood such as physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, neglect, and household adversities. Exposure to severe or long-term stress during childhood may alter the function of the biological systems, which in turn may lead to poor health outcomes. Metabolomics is the study of small molecules known as metabolites, which are products of chemical processes that take place in the body. Thus, metabolomics provides information on healthy and altered levels of metabolites, and would be a helpful tool in understanding pathways underlying disease development. Our project will utilize metabolomics to gain an understanding of how adverse childhood experiences lead to several chronic conditions within the same individual. The findings from this project will help to identify individuals who are at risk of developing poor health outcomes so that interventions can be implemented to prevent or reduce the risk of physical and mental health conditions."
Towards Data Symmetry for a Balanced Understanding of Canadian residential housing radon gas exposure,"['Goodarzi, Aaron']","['Peters, Cheryl E', 'Taron, Joshua']","['Built Environment', 'Cancer Prevention', 'Data Symmetry', 'Healthy Cities', 'Indoor Air Quality', 'Lung Cancer', 'Population Health', 'Radiation Dosimetry', 'Radon', 'Urban Design']",100000.0,467831,"1 in 5 lung cancers arise in Canadians who have never smoked, with ~110,000 cases since 2001. The most common lung cancer trigger in never-smokers is inhalation of radioactive radon gas. The amount of life spent 'at home' correlates with radon exposure, modifying lung cancer risk. Regrettably, Canadian construction practices of the past century have produced urban residential environments with buildings that capture, contain, and concentrate radon to unnatural and unsafe levels. Globally, Canadians are among the most radon-exposed people, this is worsening still. Our team has studied the relationship between radon and region, property metrics, as well as human behaviour. In this project we will place into context our detailed understanding of radon exposure as a function of building features and people, with the most recently understood diversity of properties and demographics of the Canadian population. 

The GOAL of this project is to place the most up to date residential radon gas exposure data available within the context of the most recently understood Canadian housing, health and population information. This 'data symmetry' is needed to inform physical, social and policy interventions required to reduce lung cancer risk attributable to radon inhalation within the urban built environment. The critical IMPACTS of this work will be to: (1) generate reliable measures of residential radon exposure risk in Canada that are sensitive to regional differences, and (2) to develop a clear understanding of the scale and scope of the health consequences of radon exposure, to inform the need for action. By doing this we will advance health outcomes by developing actionable, well-informed knowledge of radon exposure and lung cancer risk, and use this to address one of the most prevalent built environment-based health threats to our future cities."
Cumulative Exposure to Environmental Stressors and Protective Factors on Neurodevelopment: An Exposome-Based Approach,"['Goodman, Carly V']",['N/A'],"['Biomarkers', ""Children'S Environmental Health"", 'Prenatal Exposures', 'Public Health']",105000.0,475944,"Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), such as intellectual disability, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autism spectrum disorder, are on the rise. It is well-known that exposure to a wide variety of environmental stressors during pregnancy can impact neurodevelopment. While environmental stressors often co-occur - particularly among at-risk populations - most studies consider the effects of only one environmental exposure. Without uncovering the complex and dynamic interplay between various environmental factors, the multifactorial cause of NDDs cannot be fully understood. Therefore, the proposed study will apply the exposome concept which aims to quantify the totality of environmental exposures from conception onwards and to explain individual vulnerability and resilience to early environmental exposures. Specifically, I will assess the relative contributions of combined exposure to environmental stressors and protective factors on children's intelligence and behavioral development at age 5. This study capitalizes on the prospective New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (NHBCS), designed to examine the impact of environmental and lifestyle factors on the health of pregnant women and children living in rural New Hampshire. I will use archived data and biobank samples from the NHBCS to assess prenatal exposure to chemicals, diet quality, maternal depression, and socioeconomic status, as well as the quality of the home environment, and the parent-child relationship. I will use a state-of-the-art analytical technique that enables the measurement of the combined and interactive impact of environmental stressors and protective factors on neurodevelopment. Understanding the neurodevelopmental impact of environmental exposures during early brain development presents an opportunity to improve health equity through informing policy- and practice-oriented solutions that can reduce risks."
Addressing community concerns about health risks from Helicobacter pylori infection in Northern Canada,"['Goodman, Karen J']","['Fletcher, Christopher', 'Girgis, SAFWAT', 'Keelan, Monika M', 'Veldhuyzen Van Zanten, Sander J', 'Yasui, Yutaka']","['Aboriginal Health', 'Circumpolar Health', 'Community-Based Participatory Research', 'Digestive Diseases', 'Helicobacter Pylori']",1435273.0,226230,"Despite limited systematic data on its presence in northern Canada, Helicobacter pylori infection has been an emerging health concern in northern Aboriginal communities, where people are becoming aware of its health risks. In many such communities, people worry about the link between H. pylori and stomach cancer, a cancer that occurs more frequently in this region than on average across Canada. Physicians in the north view this infection as a major problem because it is found in many patients with common stomach complaints and standard treatment is often ineffective in this setting. Health authorities have identified the need for research aimed at developing H. pylori control strategies appropriate for the north. The proposed research seeks to generate knowledge about how health care decision makers can effectively manage H. pylori infection in a manner that addresses community concerns. To begin working toward these goals, the applicants formed the Canadian North Helicobacter pylori (CANHelp) Working Group, a collaborative team that links the University of Alberta with northern health authorities and community organizations. While the research goals require data from multiple northern settings, the team conducted a pilot project as a starting point in Aklavik, NWT, where they found that 62% of 355 participants had H. pylori infection, and among those infected, there was a high prevalence of precancerous stomach conditions. The objectives of the current proposal, developed at the request of northern communities are to: 1) Expand the research to additional communities in the NWT and Yukon to obtain representative data for informing regional public health strategies pertaining to H. pylori infection; 2) Identify cost-effective H. pylori management strategies for northern communities; 3) Create knowledge exchange strategies to help community members understand H. pylori health risks and currently available solutions."

Indigenous communities, however, experience inequitable access to academic centres and scholars. Those with little access may seek research to promote health but may not have resources or capacity to develop research questions, locate relevant scholars, or guide research. We have assembled a team of community and academic research partners who can help reduce inequitable access to research that benefits communities. Our community partners have expertise in facilitating such research. They can share this expertise with others who seek research but do not know where to start. Our academic partners have effective tools for enabling community partners to guide research aimed at achieving their goals. With experts in public health, policy, social, statistical, medical laboratory, and health care sciences, our network will have the capacity to help communities design and conduct interdisciplinary research with any health focus they prioritize. Our team has successfully engaged Indigenous communities in research that community members designed for their own benefit and controlled from start to finish throughout western Canada, Arctic Canada, Uganda, and the Peruvian Amazon. 

This project aims to create a network that supports access to community-driven Indigenous health research that integrates relevant biomedical, clinical, health services, and social-cultural-environmental methods. To prepare a NEIHR grant application, we will engage communities in carrying out the following specific aims: 
1) review relevant literature and other information sources;
2) gather community input on priorities, strengths and needs;
3) create a toolkit for community-driven research;
4) engage communities in designing a network;
5) pilot test the network."
Factors influencing the effectiveness and appeal of Traffic Light labelling among Canadians.,"['Goodman, Samantha E']",['N/A'],"['Canadian', 'Front-Of-Package', 'Labelling', 'Nutrition', 'Obesity']",105000.0,257443,"Diet-related health problems place a great burden on the Canadian economy as levels of obesity and chronic diseases continue to rise. Nutritional labelling on food products has emerged as an important population-level intervention for promoting healthy eating habits. International evidence suggests that front-of-package (FOP) labels may be more effective at helping consumers choose healthier products compared to back-of-package nutrition information alone. Traffic Light (TL) labels are located on the FOP and highlight amounts of key nutrients in red, amber and green Traffic Lights that signify high, medium and low amounts of a nutrient, respectively. Although these labels have been implemented voluntarily in the UK, few studies have examined their effectiveness in Canada. The current study aims to examine the effectiveness and appeal of TL labels among Canadian consumers. Study results have the potential to inform key policy decisions regarding the implementation of TL labels in Canada. Mandatory TL labelling could help consumers choose healthier options when grocery shopping, which would ultimately help to decrease rates of obesity and diet-related health conditions."

Loneliness refers to having fewer or less close relationships than a person would like, whereas social isolation means not having many relationships with other people. LSI have been linked to the development of physical illnesses, mental health problems, impaired cognitive functioning and a higher risk of death. Low-income older adults in social housing have many important risk factors for LSI. The majority are women who live alone with inadequate income, may have personal health challenges and have often lost a spouse or partner. 

In the spring of 2019, our team ran a successful 14-week program (Building Bridges) to enhance social interaction with 53 older adults in seniors' social housing. A major research priority for participants was the development of strategies to address LSI. Our team includes four patient advisors who participated in the program and two older adults from the Saskatoon Council on Aging. This proposal reflects the guidance and direction from these key team members.

Our aim is to co-design, implement and evaluate patient-oriented strategies to address LSI in two seniors' social housing units. Using a variety of research methods and guided by Age-Friendly and Positive Aging approaches, we will: 1) determine the patterns of LSI in the units; 2) elicit the perspectives, priorities and preferences for strategies to address LSI through meaningful and cooperative dialogue with tenants; 3) assess the ways in which Life Story Work might address LSI; 4) co-create and evaluate an eight week group program; and 5) build community capacity to create a sustainable approach to addressing LSI. World Cafés, surveys, interviews, Life Story Work and focus groups will provide us with rich, patient-oriented data to meet our objectives and guide future research."

Out on the street: A critical ethnography with homeless 2SLGBTQ+ youth who use drugs,"['Goodyear, Trevor H']",['N/A'],"['2slgbtq+ People', 'Community-Based Research', 'Critical Ethnography', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health Service Research', 'Homelessness', 'Housing', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Substance Use', 'Youth']",105000.0,439950,"Two-Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and other queer (2SLGBTQ+) youth are known to face many social challenges, including bullying, rejection from family and friends, homophobia, and transphobia. These social determinants place 2SLGBTQ+ youth at much higher risk of homelessness and substance use. Alarmingly, 2SLGBTQ+ people are estimated to make up as much as 40% of the overall homeless youth population in Canada. Of further concern, those who use drugs experience inequitably high rates of drug-related harms, including overdose, sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections, and criminalization. In British Columbia, these negative outcomes are poised to be exacerbated by intersecting public health crises related to opioid overdoses, housing affordability, and COVID-19. In response to these crises, innovative health policy and programming interventions in BC are now underway, including the provision of a safer drug supply, the scale-up of outreach-based harm reduction services, and expansion of housing shelters and subsidies. Yet, it remains unclear how these services can be tailored to best serve homeless 2SLGBTQ+ youth who use drugs - a critical research gap, given inequities and public health challenges faced. This study addresses this gap by using community-based, critical ethnographic approaches to examine the drug-, housing-, and broader health-related experiences of homeless 2SLGBTQ+ youth who use drugs, with particular attention to how these experiences are influenced by features of healthcare services and broader socio-structural environments. Set in Vancouver, British Columbia, this study will include intensive qualitative interviews and arts-based photovoice methods with 40 homeless 2SLGBTQ+ youth who use drugs. Findings from this study will identify how interventions (e.g., clinical, programming, structural policies) can best be used to reduce drug-related harms and improve health and social outcomes for this priority population."

We propose the Engage-COVID-19 Study to rapidly respond to current and pressing knowledge gaps concerning the COVID-19 pandemic among GBM in Canada. This study will be embedded within the Engage Cohort Study, which is the only study with comparable biobehavioural data on HIV/STI prevalence and risk behaviours for GBM in Canada. 

To date, baseline data collection has been completed with 1842 GBM who are enrolled in the Engage Cohort Study (565 in Vancouver, 388 in Toronto, and 889 in Montreal). All of these participants will be invited to have SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing and complete an in-depth survey that will include COVID-specific quantitative questions. We anticipate recruiting a total sample of 1695-1768 participants. In addition, from this group we will recruit 90 GBM participants for qualitative interviews in Vancouver (30), Toronto (30), and Montreal (30) to assess the direct and indirect impacts of COVID-19 on Canadian GBM. These data are necessary both to understand COVID-19 risks, vulnerabilities, and prevention strategies, as well as the impacts of COVID-19 on health service access and different levels of HIV/STI risk across provinces. By making efficient use of available research infrastructure, our proposed study will ascertain the occurrence of COVID-19 by documenting SARS-CoV-2 immunity within both HIV-positive and -negative participants and produce rapid, high-quality evidence for preventing the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 for this population across multiple jurisdictions."

This rise in SMM is mostly due to the increase in risk factors, including high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, and older age at first pregnancy. The most common SMMs are preeclampsia (high blood pressure and organ dysfunction in pregnancy), cardiac conditions, and severe blood loss. Preeclampsia results in severe maternal and fetal complications and is one of the leading causes of maternal death. Aspirin has been shown to reduce the chance of developing preeclampsia when given before 20 weeks of pregnancy. However, the benefit of aspirin for SMM and other pregnancy complications is not clear. Women who develop SARS-CoV-2 infection also have a higher chance of developing pregnancy complications. However, whether aspirin is useful in this group of women is unknown. There is therefore a need to better understand which women would benefit from the use of aspirin early in pregnancy. 

Our study will use administrative health databases from Ontario, including health records for 14 million residents and a detailed pregnancy registry, to answer this question. In women at risk of preeclampsia, we will compare the chance of having SMM and pregnancy complications in users and non-users of aspirin. The main outcomes we will study include maternal and fetal complications, such as maternal death, a heart attack, severe blood loss, preterm birth, low birth weight, and fetal death. We will also identify characteristics of women and their environments that put them at higher risk of SMM and pregnancy complications.  

If aspirin is found to reduce the number of SMM and pregnancy complications, it will help to target treatment in women at highest risk. Given the impact of SMM on the health of mothers and children, this study will have important policy, clinical, and public health implications."
The effect of birth weight and the perinatal environment on the weight trajectory of normal and obese children,"['Gravel, Jonathan M']",['N/A'],"['Birthweight', 'Childhood Obesity', 'Longitudinal Study Of Child Development', 'Nutrition', 'Physical Activity', 'Singleton Vs. Twin Births', 'The Barker Hypothesis']",17500.0,201202,"In recent years, the prevalence of overweight and obesity among children has increased markedly around the globe. It has increased across Canada with over 26% of children and youth now considered overweight or obese. It is therefore crucial that we no longer wait until adulthood to intervene. A number of  perinatal factors, including birth weight play a significant role and surely fit a predictive model of weight trajectory in both normal and obese children. In Quebec, two important longitudinal studies are following children from birth that have the power to shed light on these relationships. The first one, the Longitudinal study of child development in Quebec (LSCDQ), the Singleton Study collects yearly data on child health and development from a representative sample (n=2,103) of children born in 1998 in the province of Quebec. The second one, called the Quebec Newborn Twin Study (QNTS), is performed on 600 pairs of twins followed since their birth in the same period of time and the same population. Longitudinal analysis of a wide range of anthropometric, health, behavioral and social variables of a long follow up study may significantly aid in the understanding of the childhood weight trajectory and the occurrence of obesity in childhood. This knowledge will be crucial for determining at what age and what type of intervention will most impact this catastrophic epidemic."
Does low Vitamin D status of older Canadians predict functional decline?,"['Gray-Donald, Katherine A']","['Payette, Hélène', 'Weiler, Hope A']","['Functional Declines With Aging', 'Nutrition And Aging', 'Nutritional Epidemiology']",91458.0,170992,"Several studies have studied vitamin D status and functional decline in the elderly, but the results have been very inconclusive. In people (usually institutionalized sick elderly who have very low levels of vitamin D in their blood) there is a benefit from supplementation with vitamin D. As most elderly people in Canada, however, are healthy and live at home, get outdoors and eat well, their vitamin D levels are not usually severely compromised but we have found that over 50% of our Quebec healthy community dwelling elderly population have suboptimal vitamin D levels warranting further examination. From existing data on a large group of healthy elderly Quebecers whom we have followed over 3 years and measured declines in their functional status we will study whether optimal Vitamin D status protects against functional decline in a healthy aging population."
Development of a Canadian Research Agenda on Preconception and Interconception Care,"['Greaves, Lorraine J', 'Poole, Nancy']",['N/A'],"['Environmental Scan', 'Preconception Care', 'Research Agenda']",9990.0,325201,"Pregnancy has typically been identified as a key time for intervening with women to address risk factors such as alcohol and tobacco use, and improve pregnancy and birth related outcomes. However, there is evidence that waiting until women and their partners are expecting is often too late. Addressing risk factors and promoting health among girls, boys, women and men earlier is needed to support reproductive health for all. Despite the clear need for programs to promote and improve health prior to pregnancy and parenting, Canada does not currently have a set of national guidelines on pre- and inter-conception care. Approaches that are limited to the time of pregnancy and focus on the responsibility of women to ensure the health of the fetus/ child minimize the importance of women's health, and are particularly challenging for women who do not have the resources or support to make health changes during pregnancy. Drawing on a variety of literature, this project will address this gap by conducting a scan of current programs and initiatives in Canada, the USA and internationally. Existing programs will be analyzed for evidence of effectiveness for promoting health during this period among women and men. Research needs will be identified and a research agenda for furthering this work in Canada will be drafted.  In addition, existing guidelines will be analyzed to support recommendations for guideline development in Canada."

Substance use has also risen, with Canadians reporting more alcohol, cannabis and tobacco use during COVID-19 measures. In the proposed rapid review, we will examine how containment and pandemic related measures affects IPV and substance use among women, including level of consumption, types of substances used and changes in patterns of use. We will partner with three knowledge users representing first responders, shelters and substance use services, to co-develop evidence-based materials to support health care practitioners, IPV workers, substance use workers, and first responders in their work. We will apply sex, gender, equity, harm reduction and trauma informed lenses to analyze the literature and develop knowledge products. These materials will include information on IPV, substance use and COVID-related issues, guidance on responding to these issues, and suggestions for providing health advice and brief interventions."

As a result, a Community Advisory Committee (CAC) came together to establish Takohpinawasowin, a way to explore how the first-hand accounts of traditional birthing and early child-rearing practices could benefit families and communities of FHQTC. Specifically, this research has two main overarching goals: First, stories of Elders' and Knowledge Keepers' teachings of traditional maternal and obstetrical care will be explored through Indigenous Research Methods (IRM) and Participatory Action Research (PAR), that privilege both traditional teachings and collaborative community research processes such as sharing circles, storytelling, symbol-based reflection, observation and experiential learning. Employing PAR and Collective Consensual Data Analytic Procedure (CCDAP) will provide a better understanding of how collaborative Indigenous research methods can be developed, supported, implemented and celebrated through Indigenous community leadership and capacity building. Secondly, as the intent is to recover traditional knowledge(s) of birthing and parenting, practices, these lessons can be used to further develop resources to teach, inform and disseminate this knowledge to community members and to other social and health agencies who work with First Nations communities. In this way, Takohpinawasowin can assist parents to develop healthy family relationships, sustain cultural cohesiveness and social bonding and can further address the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's recommendations that value Indigenous healing practices."

It is important to widen the range of health and social services to meet the unique needs of HIV-positive mothers. The HIV Mothering Study is an observational, mixed methods, community-based research study that aims to enhance understanding of the psychosocial experiences and needs of HIV-positive women across Ontario during pregnancy and early motherhood. In narrative interviews, HIV Mothering Study participants reveal a number of important issues for further exploration including child protection system involvement, opportunities for support in pregnancy and post partum and infant feeding. This proposal seeks funding to support meetings and consultations to develop an operating grant proposal to expand the HIV Mothering Study and to plan support and/or educational interventions for HIV-positive mothers, service providers and other relevant stakeholders across Ontario, Canada and beyond. This planning grant will enable engagement in dialogues with: 1) clinicians and community-based service providers across Ontario: (a) to identify research priorities for the development of an operating grant; (b) to share findings and lessons learned from the HIV Mothering Study to determine the nature of interventions to be developed; 2) HIV Mothering Study participants to determine their involvement in future phases of the project; and 3) HIV-positive mothers and service providers in provinces not currently represented in the HIV Mothering Study: (a) to understand the research and practice landscape across Canada for HIV-positive mothers; and (b) to assess interest and engagement of stakeholders across Canada for the development of an operating grant and other research initiatives for HIV-positive mothers."
Measuring uptake and effectiveness of direct-acting antiviral treatment for hepatitis C among key populations in Ontario: a population-based retrospective cohort study,"['Greenwald, Zoë']",['N/A'],"['Direct-Acting Antivirals', 'Health Administrative Data', 'Health Disparities Research', 'Hepatitis C Virus', 'Immigrant Populations', 'People Who Inject Drugs', 'Population-Based Cohorts']",105000.0,439390,"Hepatitis C virus (HepC) targets the liver and, if left untreated, can lead to cirrhosis, liver cancer, and death. HepC is a major public health problem in Canada, affecting an estimated 250,000 Canadians and leading to more years of life lost than any other infectious disease. However, with the advent of a HepC cure (direct-acting antiviral treatment) in 2015, public health efforts have shifted towards the elimination of HepC. Achieving elimination will require reaching key populations - including people who inject drugs and immigrants from HepC-endemic countries - that are disproportionately burdened by HepC and who may also experience unique challenges in accessing healthcare. To date, there is a lack of research assessing the uptake and effectiveness of direct-acting antiviral treatment for HepC in Ontario at a population-level, both overall and within key populations - my proposed research project aims to fill this knowledge gap. 

This proposed research will use data from a population-based cohort of people living with chronic HepC in Ontario to address the following objectives: 1) measure direct-acting antiviral treatment uptake in Ontario; 2) identify potential disparities in direct-acting antiviral treatment uptake among key populations; 3) estimate the effect of direct-acting antiviral treatment on health outcomes including liver-related and all-cause mortality and explore whether treatment effectiveness differs meaningfully between members of key populations and other Ontarians.

This research will provide evidence on the uptake and effectiveness direct-acting antiviral treatment among all Ontarians with chronic HepC. Planned comparisons of treatment uptake and effectiveness between members of key populations and other Ontarians may inform future provincial (or national) interventions to reduce HepC-related disparities and work towards HepC elimination."

Validation of a harmonization tool for combining data from cohort studies on healthy aging,"['Griffith, Lauren E']","['Fortier, Isabel', 'Raina, Parminder S', 'Wolfson, Christina M']","['Harmonization', 'Healthy Aging', 'Physical Activity']",50000.0,228746,"Canada has been facing a steady increase in the average age of its population. This shift in age of the population has made it very important to understand why some people experience healthy aging and others do not. The Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) aims to learn more about the changes linked with aging by enrolling 50,000 Canadian residents and studying how many different components of healthy aging interact. Although the CLSA will be able address many research questions, some questions will require a larger sample than that of the CLSA to answer.  One way to answer questions that require a very large sample size is to combine data from a number of similar studies on healthy aging.  The difficulty is that studies may use different questionnaires to collect the same sort of information.  For example, one study may ask people the number of glasses of red wine they consume per week and another may ask the number of glasses of wine they consume in a month. The first task is to determine whether these questions are collecting the same type of information and if so, how can the data be converted so that they are on the same scale.  In example above the task is quite easy, but in many cases it will be more challenging.  

We propose to use a new methodology that has been developed by the Public Population Project in Genomics (P3G) to decide whether data can be combined from different studies and to convert the study-specific information into a common format so that it can be analysed together. This methodology, however, is relatively new and requires testing to make sure that the process provides accurate information on which to answer important research questions in aging. This study will examine whether the P3G method can be used by to harmonize data from large cohort studies on aging to answer research questions that require a very large sample size."

Ces ateliers interactifs, réalisés par un duo de bénévoles dûment formé·e·s par l'organisme, correspondent à des témoignages personnels et intimes livrés auprès de publics variés, principalement dans les milieux scolaires et jeunesse. Le projet de recherche proposé par l'organisme vise à mettre en lumière les effets de l'engagement social de ces bénévoles sur leur santé globale. Cette démarche vise donc trois objectifs :
1. Modéliser les trajectoires d'engagement social des bénévoles, de l'expression de leur intérêt à joindre l'organisme lors d'une séance d'information à la réalisation d'une intervention par le témoignage en classe;
2. Identifier les effets de l'engagement social par le témoignage sur la santé globale des bénévoles impliqué·e·s au sein du GRIS-Montréal;
3. Documenter les facteurs qui favorisent ou entravent le maintien de l'engagement social des bénévoles au sein de l'organisme.
Le projet s'appuie sur les nombreux travaux associant l'engagement social et les bienfaits sur la santé globale. Durant les 27 dernières années, le GRIS a constaté que la méthode du témoignage apporte à ses bénévoles de nombreux bienfaits (connaissance et acceptation de soi, aisance à se dévoiler), mais peut aussi fragiliser leur implication, particulièrement pour les groupes sous-représentés, dont les personnes bisexuelles ou pansexuelles, trans et non-binaires, racisées ou celles en situation de handicap. Le présent projet s'inscrit donc résolument dans une perspective intersectionnelle.
Pour mener à bien le projet, l'organisme compte utiliser deux manières pour rejoindre ses bénévoles. Un questionnaire abordera les motivations à se joindre au GRIS et les effets perçus de cet engagement. Puis, des entrevues individuelles seront menées pour comprendre les facteurs permettant ou empêchant le maintien de l'engagement."

These cancers can be found early with an oral examination making them as easy to find as skin cancer. Unfortunately, due to low rates of such examinations and patients who delay seeing a doctor about their symptoms (usually a sore in the mouth), about 40% of patients are diagnosed with advanced disease, which is very difficult to cure. 
Most previous research has recorded the number of days that patients waited before seeking help for symptoms and the number of days between first seeing a doctor and the final diagnosis. Generally, researchers have found that the delay created by the patient is much longer than the delay created by the 'system'. There is very little information about why the delay happens.
In this study, we will ask patients to tell us about what happened during the time between noticing symptoms and seeking a doctor's appointment. In particular, we are interested in knowing whether knowledge about oral cavity cancer, and/or a willingness to get information about oral cavity cancer, and/or the advice recieved from family and friends influenced the amount of time that the patient says they waited until calling for a doctor (or dentist) appointment. Separately, we will also investigate whether these same factors are associated with the size of the tumour, which is an objective measure of the amount of time that passed between the presence of symptoms and the diagnosis of the mouth cancer. 
It is extremely troubling that so many patients have advanced, difficult to cure disease. Very little is understood about why this is happening and the potential to improve cure rates if we can improve the timeliness of diagnoses is enormous. Our results may point to the need for more education about mouth cancer symptoms for people who are at high risk of the disease and for their friends and family."

When women are employed, they use their wages to feed and educate their children and support their families. Rates of infant mortality and population growth decline, thus improving additional prospects for global ecosystem health. These facts were recognized by the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health who called for ""improvement of the well-being of girls and women and the circumstances in which their children are born"". Research has shown that health risks can arise from structural gender inequalities which include lower education levels, lack of autonomy, societal preference for sons, barriers to land ownership and poorer access to employment and health care. 
Aquaculture is the fastest growing food-producing sector in the world -employing 19.3 million people globally and more than 300,000 in Africa. Tanzanian women have been historically engaged in artisanal fishing and marketing which has provided fundamental sources of income and food for their families. Yet the emerging, more lucrative commercial aquaculture sector is increasingly dominated by men due to discrimination against women for jobs and in land ownership. Women are finding employment in post-harvest fish processing and marine seaweed harvesting which have been shown to be associated with adverse working conditions, inequitable economic benefits and significant life changes. Research on these conditions, inequities and impacts, in Africa, is scant to non-existent. 
The purpose of this application is to launch a research collaboration with an international research team and stakeholders through five days of meetings and site visits in Tanzania.The outcome will be a grant proposal that will examine these gender and health inequities in relation to fish farming and aquaculture work in Tanzania."

The purpose of this study was to determine whether meeting the 24-hour movement behaviors were associated with dimensions of impulsivity. Data from this cross-sectional observational study were part of the first annual curated release of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. Participants included 4524 children between the ages of 8 and 11 years. Children were assessed on eight different dimensions of impulsivity, such as their tendency to seek out thrilling experiences, to set desired goals, to respond sensitively to rewarding or unpleasant stimuli, and to act rashly in negative and positive moods. Results showed that adherence to individual movement behavior recommendations as well as combinations of adherence to movement behavior recommendations were associated with each dimension of impulsivity. Specifically, the results showed that children who met all three movement behaviors scored more favorably on 5 of the 8 dimensions of impulsivity, and that children who met the screen time and sleep recommendations scored more favorably on all 8 dimensions of impulsivity. These findings have important implications for pediatricians, psychiatrists, educators, parents, and policy makers as they suggest that strategies to limit recreational screen time while simultaneously promoting early, routine bedtimes and more sleep may enhance the treatment and prevention of impulsivity-related psychiatric disorders."

Each of them is more at risk than their classmates of having diabetes and heart disease before graduating high school. Adults living with diabetes for many years are at risk of having heart-related health problems and dying because of these problems, but youths with diabetes are at risk of having these problems very early - while still in school. Early signs of heart disease might include a stiffer heart, high blood pressure, or high blood fat. It is unclear why the heart stiffens, and blood pressure and blood fat rise earlier in persons with type 2 diabetes. However, current studies involve older adults that have had diabetes for many years, which means their results also reflect normal aging. New research suggests that a mother's health during pregnancy influences her baby's lifelong heart disease risk. My project tests the theory that if a mother has diabetes during pregnancy, her child is at higher risk of heart disease. I also want to know if better education and/or income reduce this risk. To answer these questions, I will use data collected since 1981 in all of Manitoba to see if Manitobans exposed to diabetes in pregnancy are more likely to have heart disease than those not exposed to diabetes. Using the same data, I will also see if those who were exposed to diabetes and graduated high school and/or have higher income are less at risk of heart disease than those who were exposed to diabetes but did not graduate or had a lesser income. These results may explain why so many persons with diabetes have heart disease, and show that better education or income can prevent this.

Smoking is the leading cause of lung disease: smoking causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (including emphysema and chronic bronchitis) and most cases of lung cancer; smokers are about 12 times more likely to die from COPD than nonsmokers and 25 times more likely to develop lung cancer. We will study the impact of tobacco prices on smoking onset, smoking cessation, and tobacco consumption in Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, South Africa, and Vietnam.

The effects of both tax and retail price will be further analyzed according to their effect by socioeconomic status, sex, and age with simulations to determine the ultimate impacts on tax revenue, tobacco use, and health outcomes. Additionally, the impact of cigarette packaging, including plain packaging, and major recent country-specific policy changes will be analyzed. There is overwhelming evidence that higher cigarette prices reduce tobacco use with greater reductions among young people and those from more socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. The tobacco industry, however, asserts that tobacco taxes harm vulnerable populations and lead to increased consumption of illicit cigarettes and that packaging policies are ineffective. Evidence generated by this research will be used to address these claims with the aim of influencing tax policy and tobacco product labeling practices in low- and middle-income countries with the goal of ultimately preventing ill health and deaths caused by tobacco consumption."

We will focus our analysis on ENDS use intentions (among young nonusers), purchase decisions (among users), and risk perceptions (among young nonusers and users). Given the comprehensive gendered approach used by the ENDS industry, we will pay particular attention to sex, gender and other associated factors (e.g., ethnicity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status) from design to reporting and knowledge translation.

"Understanding heat-related illness, injury, and differential vulnerability among workers in British Columbia","['Guo, Xiaocong']",['N/A'],"['Case-Crossover', 'Climate Change', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Extreme Heat', 'Heat Illness', 'Occupational Health And Safety', 'Workplace Injury']",105000.0,476153,"Extreme heat is a threat to human health. In 2021, an unprecedented heat wave affected western North America, resulting in 740 deaths in British Columbia (BC). Some workers are particularly vulnerable to hot weather due to their limited ability to control heat exposure in occupational settings (e.g., those working outdoors). From 2018 to 2020, WorkSafeBC approved almost 100 work-related claims due to heat stress. This trend is expected to continue upwards. In BC, where most of the population resides in a geographic area with a temperate climate, extreme heat reveals major gaps in our understanding of how heat affects workers. The majority of evidence is derived from the general population and a few target subgroups (e.g., elderly), which seriously limits our abilities to infer impacts, assess trends, and inform policies and practices that reduce heat-related risks among workers. To build this foundational knowledge base, I will conduct a review to collate and assess epidemiological evidence of occupational heat-related health impacts, and a scan of policies and practices in relation to heat exposure of workers from jurisdictions across Canada and the world. Subsequently, I will examine the relationships between heat and health outcomes (heat illness and injury) among workers aged 15 and greater in BC to identify occupational and individual characteristics (e.g., demographics, chronic health conditions) that place workers at greater risk. This will not only address a critical gap in the association between heat exposure and occupational health, but also become a valuable first step in the future optimization of policies/practices and create a foundation for more personalized heat stress management programs targeting vulnerable workers to promote health equity and mitigate heat-related risks among workers in BC."

PrEP involves taking a single dose of the same medication that people living with HIV use, but to prevent infection. Currently, PrEP is not widely available in Canada, but some physicians are already prescribing it to MSM. Clinical trials have shown that PrEP could dramatically reduce the cases of new HIV infections if taken correctly. However, there remain many questions that still need to be answered about how PrEP will be used in practice. This project will use interviews conducted in major cities in Canada to collect the experiences of clinicians (e,g., physicians, nurses, and social workers) and diverse groups of MSM about PrEP related clinical encounters, and what they see as the opportunities and challenges presented by this new HIV prevention approach. This project has implications for improving clinical guidelines and MSM targeted programing."

A number of research studies, many conducted in Canada, have shown the benefits of a treatment-as-prevention approach where people living with HIV are put on treatment early to improve their health and reduce their infectiousness. However, some scholars have raised concerns about the possible consequences for people living with HIV and health care providers tasked with monitoring treatment adherence. In particular, concerns have been raised about the implications for people who refuse treatment or are unable to adhere to their drug regimen. Currently, those most affected have not been included in these debates. This project will interview people living with HIV and healthcare providers working in the HIV sector to explore the ethical and social dimensions of these new prevention approaches.

Being able to correctly detect AD at a very early stage is very important in the treatment of the disease. A step forward would be to better understand how Alzheimer's disease progresses and develop detection methods that can be used to improve the accuracy of early detection. To do this we will use an international database which contains clinical and imaging data from thousands of patients. We will study two main topics:  First, we will ask which factors are different in normal ageing from the early signs of AD. Second, we will aim to better understand how these factors change as the disease progresses across its different stages. To achieve this, we will use new mathematical techniques we have successfully applied in other disease areas.  Our findings can help change how we think about AD and how doctors treat AD."

While previous research has explored many potential risk factors for suicide among Aboriginal populations, there have been no studies explicitly examining the relationship between family structure and suicidal behaviours. This study will quantitatively explore that relationship for off reserve young adults, ages 15 to 25, using data from the 2006 Aboriginal Peoples Survey, otherwise known as the APS. The APS is a national cross sectional survey of 61,041 First Nations, Inuit and Metis peoples. The primary relationship of interest is between suicidal behaviours, including suicidal ideation and attempts, and family structure, including parental divorce, childhood adoption, number of siblings, etc. The study will asses patterns in age, sex, and socioeconomic position. Additional variables unique to the APS that will be considered include measures of culture and identity, such as Aboriginal language literacy; land activities such as fishing, trapping and gathering; access to social supports; and diversity and quality of access to health care professionals. This is the first study to examine the relationship between family structure and suicide among off reserve Aboriginal individuals in Canada using the 2006 APS. Results will contribute to the literature and inform further research. Additionally, the results can inform policy makers and Aboriginal suicide prevention and intervention strategies."

A majority of Canadians eat high amounts of red and processed meats, which increases chronic disease risk and is also a key contributor of greenhouse gas emissions and environmental degradation. Canadians also throw away too much food. Food waste is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Food waste also has important nutritional consequences as over half of the foods Canadians throw away are fruit and vegetables. To preserve our health and the health of the planet, we need effective strategies that support Canadians to eat more plant-based protein and reduce food waste. The goal of this research is to test the impact of Supper Heroes, a family-based mobile health intervention designed to help families reduce their food waste and increase their intake of minimally processed plant-based proteins. To achieve this goal, we will test whether families who receive - over 6 months -- a mobile app that includes 7 interactive modules, mailed behavioural supports, and text messages (intervention group) have lower food waste and higher intakes of plant-based protein foods as compared to families who receive monthly emails with general health messages (control group). Our interdisciplinary team with expertise in randomized controlled trials, food waste, and behaviour change has partnered with knowledge users in public health and municipal waste management to develop and deliver this intervention. As a result, this research could provide a scalable and cost-effective model for healthy and sustainable eating that can lead to long-term improvements in individual and planetary health."

The main analysis will examine differences between experimental conditions in the calorie content of the meal consumed by participants. In Study 2, 4 food outlets located at the University of Waterloo (2 ""sit-down restaurants"" and 2 fast-food outlets) have agreed to participate in a naturalistic study of menu labelling. Following a 1-month ""baseline"" period, one restaurant and one fast-food outlet will be randomly selected to display calorie information next to each food and beverage item on their menus for a 1-month period, with the remaining 2 outlets serving as controls. Surveys will be conducted during the baseline and intervention periods at each of the 4 outlets to examine differences in menu selection and calorie consumption among patrons.

This time-sensitive research is urgently needed to inform future policy in Canada and similar initiatives in other countries."
The impact of vaping policies on the e-cigarette product market and youth vaping.,"['Hammond, David G', 'Arango, Manuel']","['Boudreau, Christian', 'East, Katherine', 'Fong, Geoffrey T', ""O'Connor, Richard J""]","['E-Cigarettes', 'Health Behaviour', 'Policy', 'Tobacco Control', 'Vaping', 'Youth']",24377.0,425743,"In May 2018, e-cigarettes containing nicotine became legally available for sale in Canada under the TVPA, along with increased marketing and retail access for major international brands, such as JUUL. In the following two years, the prevalence of youth vaping in Canada doubled. In response, provinces have announced a range of policy measures to be implemented in 2020-including restrictions on retail access, flavours, nicotine, and product design. The variation in these policies across provinces provides a unique opportunity for a 'natural experiment' research design. The proposed study has two primary objectives: to examine the impact of provincial policies on: 1) e-cigarette product design and retail availability, and 2) vaping behaviour among young people. The study consists of two data sources. First, an environmental scan of the e-cigarette market will be conducted in each province to collect the following information for leading e-cigarette brands in Canada: retail availability, price, nicotine content, flavours, pack design, and device components. Second, data from the environmental scan will be linked with data from the ITC Youth Tobacco and Vaping Surveys, which consists of population-based surveys of youth aged 16-19 in Canada, conducted annual between 2017 and 2021. Analyses will examine pre-post changes within provinces for four primary outcomes: 1) retail access and purchase source of e-cigarettes; 2) use of flavoured e-cigarettes; 3) product type, including nicotine concentration and use of salt-based e-cigarettes; and 4) overall changes in the prevalence of vaping across provinces.  
The proposed study represents the most comprehensive assessment of the e-cigarette product market in Canada. The study will evaluate how the industry responds to novel policies and assess the impact on youth vaping. Overall, the proposed project has the potential to directly inform e-cigarette policy in Canada and other jurisdictions."
Cannabis legalization in Canada: International Cannabis Policy Study,"['Hammond, David G']","['Abramovici, Hanan', 'Driezen, Peter', 'Freeman, Tom', 'Greaves, Lorraine J', 'Hall, Wayne D', 'Kent, Pamela', 'Kilmer, Beau', 'Pacula, Rosalie L', 'Wadsworth, Elle', 'Wilkins, Chris']","['Cannabis', 'Marijuana', 'Population Health', 'Substance Use Policy']",2134350.0,468722,"Canada has among the highest prevalence of cannabis use in the world, with modest increases following legalization of non-medical cannabis in October 2018. The long-term impact of legalization will be determined not simply by whether cannabis is legally accessible, but how it is regulated within a legal framework. Currently, there are important differences in retail policies, marketing restrictions, and product standards between Canadian provinces, and between Canada and other jurisdictions that have legalized non-medical cannabis. However, there is very little evidence on the impact of cannabis policies to inform regulatory decisions. 
The proposed study will examine a series of unique 'natural experiments' in cannabis policies using data from the International Cannabis Policy Study (ICPS). The ICPS consists of population-based surveys conducted annually with national samples in Canada and the United States. Annual surveys will be conducted over a five-year period (2023-2027) with 20,000 respondents aged 16 years and older in each year, including a minimum of 2,000 per province. ICPS surveys include comprehensive measures of cannabis consumption, indicators of problematic use, and policy-relevant measures in 6 key regulatory domains (e.g., retail policies, marketing restrictions, and product standards). ICPS survey data are linked with detailed data on cannabis policies and the retail market, which are collected annually by the research team. Analyses will focus on three primary objectives: 1) the impact of cannabis legalization on prevalence and patterns of cannabis use; 2) the impact of specific regulatory measures at the provincial level, including retail policies, marketing restrictions, health warnings, and product standards; and 3) disparities in the impact of legalization among population sub-groups. Overall, the proposed study has the potential to directly inform cannabis policy in Canada and globally."
All in a day's work: A qualitative exploration of primary care physicians' work,"['Hamoline, Rita L']",['N/A'],"['Feminist Theory', 'Medical Sociology', 'Narrative Medicine', 'Population Health', 'Primary Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Research', 'Socail Identity', 'Social Institutions', 'Sociology Of Health And Illness']",105000.0,206132,"The acute shortage of primary care physicians (PCPs) in Saskatchewan is a significant impediment to the promotion and maintenance of good health for provincial residents.  An abundance of quantitative literature illustrates high rates of stress amongst PCPs yet little qualitative knowledge exists to reveal the complex issues that underpin the experience of front line Canadian physicians. My research question ""How do primary care physicians find meaning in their work?"" will explore how PCPs manage stress and burnout while creating meaning and balance in their work. My objectives are to investigate: (1) PCPs' meaning-making strategies; (2) how social factors such as gender, age and ethnicity influence meaning-making; and (3) how contextual factors such as rural/urban location and type of practice affect meaning. Describing how PCPs create meaning will provide health policy makers, medical educators and regional health managers with knowledge and strategies pertinent to physician training, recruitment and retention. Practicing PCPs may adapt these approaches in their work situations. Suicide, drug abuse, alcoholism, and divorce among physicians reveal considerable suffering and loss of human capital. This represents a major loss to Canadian society, the health care system, to PCPs and their families.  Gender inequality, physician location, and issues of ethnicity add complexity to the problem. Even as the numbers of female medical school graduates increase, concerns about gender equity and the full involvement of female physicians continue. PCPs in rural or northern communities have additional stresses that compound job difficulties. Efforts to recruit practicing physicians and medical graduates to assume rural postings continue to fall short of meeting the demand. Despite the contextual knowledge gained from quantitative research, there remains a significant gap in a qualitative understanding of the experiences of PCPs as they are influenced by various social factors."
Evaluating the use and impact of health equity frameworks and tools: A global perspective,"['Hankivsky, Olena']",['N/A'],"['Global Public Health', 'Health Equity', 'Health Equity Frameworks', 'Intersectoral Action', 'Population Health', 'Social Determinants Of Health']",19393.0,365785,"Health inequities - avoidable and unfair differences in health status between groups, populations or individuals (Whitehead, 1999) - have become increasingly important policy priorities as health differences between socio-economic groups continue to persist and, in some cases, widen (Harvey et al., 2016; Moeller & Quiñonez, 2016; PHAC, 2016; CIHI, 2015). While there have been preliminary efforts to create inventories (e.g., CCSDH, 2015; NCCDH & NCCHPP, 2012; Pauly et al., 2013), there have been no recent systematic evaluations of health equity frameworks and tools internationally, how these have been taken up, to what extent, and their efficacy in terms of affecting health inequities. What is required at this juncture is concrete cross-sectoral knowledge exchange about best and promising practices internationally - that take into account the broader policy contexts and processes of using these frameworks - and which can help inform public health actions to promote health equity in Canada and globally. Improving the influence of health inequalities research, including evidence generated by frameworks and tools on policy and practice, is a pressing priority (Garthwaite et al., 2016; Hankivsky 2012). This project will allow for well-connected, leading Canadian and international health scholars to develop and establish a joint network of researchers and decision makers from government, international organizations and NGOs who are interested in advancing health equity frameworks and tools. Focusing on the efficacy of these tools in relation to policy contexts and processes that affect their use and impact, can be seen as an essential next step in the evolution of population health research. This can help address common challenges, open the door for collaborative work, consolidate country-specific efforts, and deepen knowledge for how those concerned with improving health inequities can best strategize around the uptake of health equity tools."

F2S activities support communities to increase the availability and consumption of local foods among students. The sequence and combination of activities changes based on the context of each community. Yet a process to enable communities to identify, adapt and implement the most suitable activities is not widely available. A promising process is a Learning Circle, which engages a wide range of community members to identify, adapt and implement Farm to School activities in their own community.

Targeting healthy lifestyle in early childhood for CVD prevention is an essential strategy to lower CVD across the population in the future. Indeed, it is during that period that lifestyle habits are shaped. Yet we have little knowledge on the effects of diet during childhood and adolescence on CVD risk factors such as blood cholesterol, blood pressure, blood glucose, and insulin resistance. In this study, we will aim inform answers to the following questions: How does diet (such as frequency of consumption of sugar sweetened beverages and fruits and vegetables) impact cardiovascular health during childhood and adolescence? Do dietary habits impact CVD risk factors in girls vs. boys differently? Do these habits impact children with a high vs. low genetic risk for CVD differently? We will undertake this study with data from Project Viva, a multiethnic cohort of mothers and their children. The cohort followed mothers and their children from pregnancy until the children reached 18 years. Our findings will inform new strategies based on dietary habits during childhood and adolescence to prevent CVD later in life. Furthermore, our findings will help us understand whether intervening on specific dietary habits work better in girls vs. boys, and better in children with a high vs. low genetic predisposition. Ultimately, it will enable the development of dietary interventions tailored to the sex and genetic risk of children in order to prevent CVD."

The extent to which the causal effects of these policies have been measured is uneven, and little to no attention has been paid to their effects on vulnerable population groups.  These interventions and policies are likely to affect individuals of different socioeconomic status differently, thereby reducing or magnifying existing differences in health behaviours and health outcomes.  We propose using innovative analytic methods to measure the causal impacts of several population health interventions on health inequalities.

In the context of cancer prevention and screening, several policies aim to change individual behaviour but may do so differently across socioeconomic groups.  Tobacco control policy, including taxation and restrictions on where smoking is permitted, have been successful in reducing overall tobacco consumption but their effects on socioeconomic inequalities in smoking are largely unknown.

We will use variation in the timing of these policies across Canadian provinces to evaluate their impacts on smoking behaviour and health inequalities across socioeconomic groups.  Clinical guidelines that recommend cancer screening at certain ages among the general population and organized cancer screening programs also have the potential to improve population health and to affect inequalities in cancer outcomes.  We will evaluate whether these two policy tools impact inequalities in cancer screening behaviour and in rates of cancer detection.

An improved understanding of the effects of population health interventions on health inequalities will enhance policymakers' abilities to tailor such interventions to address both aggregate population health outcomes and variations across vulnerable subgroups."

Global environmental changes, however, affect northern biodiversity and Inuit diets, alike, most notably through the accumulation of environmental contaminants. Since the 1990's, the consumption of country food in Nunavik has decreased markedly and the rapid transition towards a western diet has led to excessive intake of carbohydrates, salt and saturated fats. Currently, in addition to food insecurity, the prevalence of obesity and related cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors are emerging as major health concerns. There is an urgent need to study and actively promote the health benefits of native country foods while minimizing risks of exposure to contaminants.

Given the direct and indirect effects of climate change that extend beyond the health sector, Canadian governments at all levels need to significantly increase investment in interventions that promote overall health and well-being and prevent disease, instead of treating the consequences of poor health. For example, communities in rural and remote regions of Canada are more vulnerable to chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes which are linked to upstream causes like food insecurity. Solutions like local farming initiatives can be help to ensure food security in rural and remote communities by increasing access to nutritious food and reducing the cost of transporting food to these regions. We want to identify existing community-grown solutions that enable rural and remote communities in British Columbia cope with increased health vulnerabilities. We also want to understand public preferences on interventions to improve health in a changing climate. In planning towards achieving this goal, we will 1) conduct a scoping review to understand how public preferences and priorities in the context of health and climate change have been investigated, 2) explore the questions community members and decision makers have about the health vulnerabilities they face and ways to adapt given the various constraints they experience, and 3) bring together researchers, community leaders and policy experts in a forum to plan a multidisciplinary program of research to explore these questions. Our proposed planning activity will be a solid foundation for the implementation of our research project, as it will position us well to answer the core questions of communities and policy makers. This work will highlight areas for collaboration between sectors of the government and how they can be designed to maximize improvements in population health."
"Developing research priorities and disseminating knowledge about pesticide and other agricultural exposures, and select cancers","['Harris, Shelley A']","['Kramer, Desre M', 'Pahwa, Manisha', 'Spinelli, John Joseph']","['Agriculture', 'Cancer', 'Case-Control Studies', 'Knowledge Dissemination', 'Pesticides', 'Research Prioritization', 'Stakeholder Partnerships']",25000.0,271363,"Exposure to pesticides and other agricultural factors may increase the risk of developing certain types of cancer. This topic was examined in 4 large studies in the U.S. and Canada during the 1980s and 1990s. Many interesting results have been reported for over 20 years. Now, data from these studies is being combined or ""pooled"" in order to better understand the effects of pesticides and other farm-related substances on the risks of certain cancers. Existing knowledge and the scope of the joint project are large. It is important for researchers to share knowledge with relevant groups and together identify knowledge needs that can be met by using the pooled information.
We will bring together researchers and stakeholders from policy, agriculture, and industry for a 1-day knowledge exchange workshop at the Occupational Cancer Research Centre in Toronto. The workshop goals are to: 1) summarize and share key findings from these 4 studies; 2) identify stakeholder knowledge needs; 3) use this information to build on an initial set of research priorities using the pooled dataset; and, 4) develop a knowledge dissemination strategy. Backgrounders will be created before the workshop to inform participants about existing research and the pooled project. Stakeholders will help develop research priorities for analysis of the pooled data, for example, by identifying relevant pesticide combinations used on farms. Knowledge dissemination from a similar study will be discussed as an example. Facilitators will guide participants in creating a strategy to translate relevant knowledge to agricultural and other workers exposed to pesticides. Researchers will create a website and other materials with stakeholder guidance over the 1-year grant period. The overall outcomes will be a set of research priorities, a knowledge dissemination strategy, and researcher-stakeholder partnerships. This project has potential impacts on public health policy by promoting and protecting workers' health."

Due to increased screening, earlier diagnosis of CRC, and treatment improvements, mortality rates have declined for both men and women. Therefore, people with CRC are living longer life-spans. However, treatments which improve survival can also cause lasting side effects and symptom management problems that endure for years. Data are surprisingly lacking on the long-term physical and psychological symptoms, symptom management problems, and their effect on quality of life (QOL) after treatment for and recovery from CRC. The proposed research will address these gaps in our knowledge by identifying the long-term physical symptoms (e.g., fatigue, bowel dysfunction), psychological symptoms (e.g., depression, fear of cancer recurrence), symptom management problems, and their effect on quality of life in a population-based cohort of CRC survivors at least 10 years post-diagnosis and their age and gender-matched unaffected controls. Consented participants will complete validated self-report questionnaires assessing physical symptoms, psychological symptoms, symptom management, and QOL. The current study, by examining symptom severity, symptom management problems, and QOL in long-term CRC survivors, will fill a critical knowledge gap by 1) describing symptoms faced by CRC patients in the long-term, 2) helping to illuminate specific symptom management problems and their relationship to QOL, which will inform an intervention plan for future studies, 3) identifying subgroups of patients who are at risk for symptom problems and decreased QOL. The findings have the potential to improve both CRC treatment decision-making as well as long-term survivorship care planning.

Over the past ten years, there have been important developments in HIV treatment and prevention. For example, the use of antiretroviral medication therapies (ART) has been recognized as having the potential to act as a preventative measure at both the individual and the population level. In 2010, the government of British Columbia introduced a large scale program to ""seek and treat"" people living with HIV that involved prescribing ART to treat individuals and prevent the spread of the virus. This policy of ""treatment as prevention"" has not been implemented to the same degree in Ontario and Quebec. Canada has therefore begun a natural experiment on the effectiveness of this approach. We have created a national team to collaborate on HIV prevention among MSM in Canada in order to understand the effects of cross-provincial differences in the number of new cases of HIV and to address critical knowledge gaps in HIV prevention. Our team has 3 overlapping goals: (1) To develop the first ever national mulitsite study of new cases of HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) among MSM; (2) To build research capacity for HIV prevention research for MSM across Canada; and (3) Using an active, bidirectional Knowledge Translation approach, design and test HIV prevention programs for community and public health settings. Our cohort study objectives are: (1) To examine sexual behaviour and recreational drug use among MSM over a period of three years follow-up and to monitor changes in these behaviours as access to ART expands; and (2) To examine the effects of biomedical and sociohavioural HIV prevention programs on the number of new cases of HIV and STIs."

One might assume that these specialty classes may lead to greater psychological safety and to better social supports than general senior's fitness classes, since there is a built in social support network.  However, does an individual representing a sub-population (e.g. young-onset or related conditions) or minority gender (men with breast cancer) feel marginalized?

The objective of this group is to address racism, as a social determinant of health and improve the health and wellbeing of patients, trainees and staff. 

Through a scoping review of the literature, we seek to gain a better understanding of the existing policies, programs and quality improvement initiatives on addressing racism in health care organizations. 
 
There are a range of anti-racism initiatives and strategies in health care institutions including organizational change (e.g. leadership buy-in),  appropriate development and training for staff and students (e.g. educational workshops and curricula), policies and practices (e.g. racial equity hiring policies). A key challenge identified was creating sustainable change. 

This research is critical to synthesize the existing literature on anti-racism interventions in health care settings. By mapping existing interventions we can elicit lessons learned in other institutions to take evidence-informed action.

Canada's Food Guide (CFG) recommends expectant mothers to consume the required servings from each of the 4 food groups with additional recommendations to increase both their folic acid and iron intakes, while the dietary guideline for Americans made recommendations to eat a variety of healthy foods and have more folic acid, iron, and seafood. Few studies, however, have assessed the relationship of CFG on maternal and baby's health; fewer studies have examined whether different ways of eating (such as high-protein or low-fat diets) may be healthier for the mother and her baby; and very few studies have examined whether a mother's diet can improve her baby's health by ""turning on or off"" genes that may effect heart health and growth. To improve evidence-based guidance for maternal diet recommendations, data from 4 CIHR-funded birth cohorts (involving Family Atherosclerosis Monitoring in Early Life [FAMILY], Canadian Health Infant Longitudinal Development [CHILD], South Asian Birth Cohort [START], and the Aboriginal Birth Cohort [ABC]) will be pooled together to study: 1) the relationship between maternal diet and markers of maternal and baby's health; 2) the ability of a mother's diet to silence sections of her baby's genome (""methylation"") to produce health effects; and 3) understand whether changes in methylation patterns may alter gene expression and alter the risk profile of a growing baby.

Adverse events of interest will include overall measures of health services utilization (e.g. emergency room (ER) visits, hospital admissions,visits to a family doctor) and specific types of adverse events, such as fever, seizures brought on by high fever, swelling and inflammation.  Ontario health administrative data and newborn screening data will be used to identify vulnerable subgroups of children, such as those with diseases affecting metabolism, children with birth defects, or children from low income families, and explore whether these children are at increased risk of experiencing AEFIs.  We will also use the newborn screening results for each child, which include the concentrations of  numerous important metabolic factors, to develop statistical models to see if we can predict which children are most likely to experience AEFIs.  The proposed research could lead to a better understanding of which children are most likely to experience AEFIs, potentially leading to changes to recommended immunization schedule in subgroups of children identified as being at higher risk.  This could lead to the avoidance of  many AEFIs in vulnerable children. Our work could also lead to a better system of AEFI surveillance in general for Ontario allowing timely detection of problems with new vaccines after they are introduced, and a better understanding of the timing and nature of AEFIs experienced by Ontario children, and their impact on health services utilization."

The impact of addiction treatment on access to HIV treatment and HIV-related health outcomes among cocaine users,"['Hayashi, Kanna']",['N/A'],"['Addiction Treatment', 'Cocaine Use', 'Hiv/Aids']",135000.0,300349,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the modern medical treatment for HIV disease, has dramatically reduced HIV-related illness and death. Despite this exciting development, major challenges remain, including ensuring access to HAART among HIV-infected drug users, a population with known barriers to HAART. In Canada, this population is largely comprised of the most vulnerable members of society and suffers from high levels of AIDS-related morbidity and mortality. Although treatments for opioid dependence are known to improve HAART outcomes among opioid-using patients, few evidence-based treatments exist for cocaine users, and little is known about ways to help HIV-positive cocaine users access and adhere to life-saving medications. This is concerning given a major increase in crack cocaine use during the past decade in Canada and considering that a substantial proportion of the HIV epidemic in Canada is attributed to cocaine use. Scientific research is urgently needed to identify effective treatments for cocaine addiction, which also confer clinical benefits on HAART outcomes among HIV-positive cocaine users. My proposed research with Drs. Evan Wood (a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair at the University of British Columbia) and Bohdan Nosyk (Endowed Chair in the Economics of HIV/AIDS at Simon Fraser University) aims to examine the impact of addiction treatment on HAART outcomes among HIV-positive cocaine users in Vancouver. I hypothesize that existing psychosocial treatments for cocaine dependence will not bring a significant benefit on HAART outcomes. However, as new pharmacological treatments for cocaine dependence will be tested in this setting, I hypothesize that these novel treatments will have significant benefits on HAART outcomes. The study findings are expected to inform efforts to identify evidence-based treatment models for HIV-positive cocaine users in Canada and beyond."
Addiction Research Program to Reduce Costs and Improve Health,"['Hayashi, Kanna']",['N/A'],"['Crack Cocaine', 'Drug Addiction Treatment', 'Epidemiology', 'Injection Drug Use', 'Prescription Opioids']",300000.0,319933,"In Canada, social costs due to substance abuse are estimated to approach $40 billion annually. Specifically, intravenous drug use, including illicit opioids (e.g., heroin) injection, is associated with an array of health and social harms for individuals and communities, including high rates of overdoses and infectious diseases via the sharing of injection equipment. Unfortunately, some of Canada's most vulnerable populations, including Aboriginal peoples, are hardest hit by these harms. 

While some interventions, including opioid substitution therapies (e.g., methadone maintenance therapy), have proven effective in reducing injection drug-related harms, Canada is now experiencing a new epidemic of prescription opioid (PO) misuse, and little is known about how existing interventions can be optimized to address rising PO misuse, particularly among people who inject drugs. While many opioid users are also known to use cocaine, there are no approved pharmacotherapies for the treatment of cocaine addiction, necessitating urgent research efforts in this area. Lastly, while provinces have recently initiated new opioid addiction-related services, the impact of new service delivery models on PO misuse and other drug-related harms have not been fully evaluated.

My proposed research builds on my past work focused on illicit drug use and aims to reduce healthcare costs and improve health by focusing on PO misuse and polydrug users (i.e., users of opioids and cocaine). Specifically, my primary research objectives are: (1) to investigate and address the impact of emerging PO misuse and concomitant crack cocaine use on patterns of injection drug use and drug-related harm; (2) to evaluate the efficacy of a novel addiction treatment option to treat polydrug users; and (3) to evaluate the impact of new structural interventions that are relevant to polydrug users."

While this 3-year pilot decriminalization policy aims to reduce harms associated with criminal justice involvement and the barriers to life-saving supports and services among people who use drugs (PWUD), unfortunately, the threshold quantity that defines permissible simple possession is considered too low by PWUD communities and drug policy experts. Given this historic policy change, along with the associated concerns regarding its shortcomings, it is of paramount importance to evaluate how this policy is impacting the health of PWUD. When looking at the existing scientific evidence base regarding health impacts of similar decriminalization policies around the world, concerningly, there is a striking lack of research that is grounded in PWUD's lived experiences. Therefore, our group of academic researchers, the Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users (VANDU; a leading community-based organization of PWUD) and the Pivot Legal Society (a human rights legal organization) propose a community-based action-oriented research project to evaluate health impacts of the pilot decriminalization policy among PWUD in Vancouver, BC.

While the province of British Columbia (BC) is among the hardest hit, public policy related to people who use drugs (PWUD) is in a state of flux in BC and needs more scientific evidence to guide its development. 

In January 2023, Canada's first 3-year pilot policy decriminalizing simple possession of certain illegal drugs took effect in BC. It stated that re-allocation of resources from arresting people for simple possession offences to disrupting unregulated drug markets is a benefit. However, we do not know how policing drug markets is impacting the health of PWUD in today's context. Further, in recent years, many Canadian cities, including Vancouver, have escalated forced evictions in homeless encampments. Yet, little is known how the enforcement of such public use legislation is impacting health outcomes among PWUD who are over-represented in unstably housed populations. Meanwhile, so-called ""safer supply"" programs to prescribe pharmaceutical alternatives to the toxic drug supply, one of the few public health interventions designed to address the driver of the overdose crisis, are also in a state of flux. 

Our proposed project addresses these critical knowledge gaps. Our longitudinal research following >1,000 PWUD aims to evaluate the health impacts of drug market interdiction (e.g., police drug seizures) and the enforcement of public use legislation (e.g., street sweeps) among PWUD in Vancouver, BC. We will also assess the impacts of changes in the availability of prescribed pharmaceutical alternatives on drug-using behaviour, experiencing drug law enforcement and street sweeps, and the associated health outcomes. The project builds on strong ongoing community-academic partnerships and plans to inform changes in policy, laws, clinical and policing practices in BC and beyond."

Existing literature examines the challenges faced by children of incarcerated parents and overwhelmingly focuses on incarcerated fathers. 
This study uses narrative inquiry methodology to explore the combined experience of pregnancy and incarceration for Indigenous women. This study addresses many areas of incarcerated women's experiences that have received little attention: (1) What are the experiences of Indigenous pregnant women in the federal correctional system? (2) What are the needs, supports, and services for incarcerated Indigenous women who are pregnant or have recently given birth? (3) How do these experiences impact their reintegration process upon release? (4) What relationship does the incarcerated individual have with their own mother?"

METHOD: This qualitative participatory research study was conducted within an Indigenous knowledge framework with a focus on Inuit ways of knowing and storytelling. Interviews were conducted in 2011 in 3 Nunavut communities with 17 Inuit youth 16-19 years of age and 20 Inuit parents who had at least 1 teenage son or daughter between 13-19 years of age.
RESULTS: Parents in the study linked their understandings of sexual health with a series of relocation events, which occurred in the Canadian Arctic in the mid 20th century. These relocation events led to widespread disruption of Inuit families, kinships, and attachments by separating young children from their primary caregivers for extended periods of time. The traditional communication pathway about sexual health and relationships was disrupted for many families during this time. Concurrent experiences of child sexual abuse among the parents in this study compounded the trauma of being separated from their families. Severed family attachments during the settlement period and child sexual abuse were the primary factors discussed by parents in this study as contributing to the current state of sexual health in Nunavut. Youth participants identified
parents/caregivers as the preferred source of knowledge about sexual health and relationships, even if they were not learning from them at the present time. They also related sexual decision-making among youth to the broader community context and determinants of health, such as poverty.
CONCLUSION: Taking these findings into account, rebuilding and strengthening family and community relationships can make significant positive contributions to sexual health and relationships by providing supportive networks for adolescents and revitalizing"

Yet, despite a recent movement towards approaching medical care from a holistic perspective, sexuality has often been excluded from our understanding of the individual as a whole. This is especially true within palliative care settings where a patient's sexuality and need for intimacy may seem less imperative than various physical health needs. This two-phase qualitative and arts-based study will examine patient, partner and health care provider perspectives on intimacy and sexuality at end of life, enabling a strengthened understanding of the ways in which we approach conversations about sexuality as it relates to overall well-being throughout the life-course and particularly as we age. Through focus groups with health care providers, interviews with patients and their partners, and an arts based project, it will enable a strengthened understanding of the ways in which health care providers approach conversations about intimacy and sexuality at end-of-life. It will also provide valuable information about patient perspectives on intimacy and sexuality, which will enable improved provision of health care to these individuals as well as a more thorough understanding of the overall experience of death and dying for patients within hospice-based palliative care. Information generated from this work will contribute to the development of tools for patients themselves to engage in broader conversations around sexual identity and intimacy. It will provide an opportunity for decision makers to learn from patients and their loved ones directly about patient needs as they relate to sexuality, intimacy, aging and dying.

1)Youth mental health survey extension. We have been surveying youth every two months since April 2020. Under this funding, we will survey them two more times, i.e., at six months and 12 months after the last survey we conducted under the previous funding. Together, this will provide a 2.5 year picture of youth MHSU and other COVID-19 impacts, among youth with previous MHSU concerns and youth without. 
2)Youth consensus statement on a pandemic recovery strategy. Youth will generate concrete, implementation-ready recommendations for policymakers to ensure that Canada's recovery from COVID-19 will support youth MHSU, economic and educational recovery for youth, and holistic wellness across life domains.
3)Youth consensus statement on response strategies for the next pandemic. This project, identified as a top priority by our youth co-researchers, will develop youth-derived recommendations that will equip policymakers to respond more effectively to the next pandemic or public health emergency. 

As COVID-19 case counts decline and our hopes rise that Canada may be entering its recovery from the pandemic, the country will soon embark on a new phase of decision-making and planning.

Important indicators identified by those most affected include strengthened families, formalized resources for alternative pain management, protective inter-connected services, reduced crime or child welfare apprehensions, and youth resilience. This work led by the Blood Tribe Department of Health (BTDH) begins by documenting the origins and etiology of the Nation's recent opioid crisis, contextualizing the impact of a suite of initiatives undertaken by diverse community entities since 2013 to reduce associated harms. Through qualitative interviews and consensus building activities mobilized around the Blackfoot record-keeping practice of a winter count, this context will build the analytical framework through which to assess quantitative indicators available in diverse datasets across service sectors: health (e.g., fentanyl related overdoses, neo-natal withdrawal); policing (e.g., violence, recidivism); child welfare (e.g., apprehensions & placements in the community); education (e.g., high school completion, recreational involvement, enculturation); and housing (e.g., evictions, crowding). Objectives include to: 1) Contextualize the recent opioid crisis through a collaborative winter count process that invites diverse agencies and groups to pictorialize significant events framing the crisis' origins and community responses; 2) Aggregate relevant data available in health, social services, and policing to map winter count events to indicators of adverse opioid-related outcomes and indicators of impact from strategic interventions; & 3) Translate intervention impacts and processes for Blood Tribe capacity-building, and for other First Nations and systems."

This growing involvement of Indigenous patients in OAT establishes strong rationale for strengthening FN capacity to lead community-based models of care for supporting such therapies. For this knowledge synthesis opportunity, we predict that evidence for best practices, contextual factors, and community-based wrap-around support exists, though it is not likely to reflect clinical research's gold standard of randomized control trials.

Maternal depression and child mental health: Role of emotion-processing and non-maternal care.,"['Herba, Catherine M']","['Côté, Sylvana', 'Seguin, Jean R']","['Child Emotional Development', 'Child Mental Health', 'Depression And Anxiety', 'Emotion-Processing', 'Facial Expression Recognition', 'Maternal Depression', 'Prevention', 'Prospective Study']",100000.0,205769,"Children of depressed mothers are vulnerable to developing mental health problems in adolescence and adulthood. Many children are at risk since as many as 30-40% of women of childbearing age may suffer from depression. Little is known about the mechanisms placing these children at increased risk, and about interventions that could minimise long-term consequences. We plan to examine the relation between maternal depression and child mental health, focusing on how children of depressed mothers process emotional information. Emotion-processing, such as the ability to read facial expressions, is important for social development and interaction. We expect that children exposed to chronic maternal depression focus more on negative emotions (sadness, anger, fear) and less on happy expressions, increasing their risk for emotional difficulties. Previous research indicates that non-maternal care (NMC; daycare attendance) may be protective for children from high-risk families. For children of depressed mothers, NMC may reduce their exposure to maternal depression while providing a wide range of social interactions impacting on their ability to process emotional information. Our investigation is embedded within EMIGARDE, a longitudinal study of children with rich pre- and post-natal data including multiple measures of maternal depression over time, and extensive evaluations of NMC. We will assess 400 children at the age of 6.5 years and again at 8.5 years using: (1) tasks of facial expression recognition (2) interviews with children (3) teacher/parent assessments of child depression and anxiety symptoms. Maternal depression will also be assessed. A better understanding of how children process emotional information coupled with detailed information on maternal depression will help to clarify the mechanisms involved in the development of psychopathology. Knowledge of protective factors such as NMC is crucial for preventing long-term negative effects of maternal depression."

A mother's SDA in pregnancy is associated with poorer child behavioural, cognitive and language outcomes, even after accounting for her postnatal SDA and inherited influences. Yet, little is known on how SDA in pregnancy affects the child. Although various processes likely play a role, the body's stress response system, the glucocorticoid (GC) signaling pathway, may play a key role. When a mother experiences stress, she produces cortisol. Elevated SDA may render the placenta less able to protect the fetus against harmful effects of cortisol. The fetus' developing stress response system may be compromised, increasing the child's vulnerability to stress later in life. To date, most evidence comes from animal studies and human studies have only studied parts of this process in small samples. Careful examination of this pathway is needed to understand its significance in humans. We will use data from a Canadian pregnancy cohort and biobank to study associations between maternal SDA and GC biomarkers in mothers, the placenta and newborns in 600 mothers and their babies. Mothers reported on their SDA at each pregnancy trimester. At birth, placenta samples and mother and newborn hair samples were obtained. Hair cortisol concentration can capture biological stress response in mothers and fetuses in the last months of pregnancy. Placental GC signalling can be assessed by measuring expression and activity of a key enzyme and expression of GC gene receptors. This study is unique and very well setup to improve our understanding of how maternal SDA may influence stress biomarkers in the mother, fetus and placenta. This is important to determine for whom and when support or intervention to mother or child is most needed."

Addiction clinics have also developed more leniency for 'take-home' doses of medication (such as opioid agonist therapy) to encourage social isolation and support people in quarantine. However, access to a safe supply of opioids remains elusive for many PWUDs in Canada for reasons that are presently unclear. 

Integrating the expertise of PWUDs, clinicians, scientists, and legal scholars, the core aim of our project is to find ways to facilitate access to a safe supply of drugs in the context of the COVID-19. We will: 1) identify best practices for securing a safe supply for PWUDs, focused in part on how ""safe"" supply may be contextually conditioned; and 2) develop a set of recommendations and strategies to encourage the uptake of safe supply across Canada. These will take into account factors including the circumstances of PWUDs who have recently been released from prison and additional challenges related to geography, homelessness, poverty, race, and/or gender. Incorporating the lived experiences and expertise of PWUDs directly into our research, our team's combined medical, scientific, and legal training has the capacity to make sense of-and act upon-the evidence on how to provide access to a safe supply of drugs in the context COVID-19 pandemic and beyond."

"Creating safe spaces in a time of conflict: Using a feminist political economy approach to explore risks and risk mitigation by adolescent girls and women who do sex work and the availability of sexual and reproductive health services, including sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections prevention and treatment, during wartime","['Herpai, Nicole']",['N/A'],"['Conflict', 'Feminist Political Economy', 'Global Public Health', 'Health Inequalities', 'Mixed-Methods Research', 'Sex Work', 'Sexual And Reproductive Health', 'Sexually Transmitted And Blood-Borne Infections', 'Ukraine', ""Women'S And Girls' Health""]",105000.0,475424,"Since 2014, Ukraine has been in a protracted conflict, which escalated into a national full-scale war in 2022. Ukraine has the highest prevalence of HIV in Europe, and female sex workers have a reported prevalence of 3.1%, three times the national average. Typically, non-governmental organizations deliver sexual and reproductive health (SRH) services, including sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections prevention and treatment, for adolescent girls and women who do sex work. Due to war related disruptions, there is an urgent need to map the impact on health care service delivery across the country. Successful SRH services are built on experiential knowledge of risk mitigation employed by adolescent girls and women who do sex work; their experiences are a central, yet under-studied, aspect of conflict and recovery.

I will address these gaps using a phased mixed-methods approach grounded in feminist political economy. In collaboration with our research partner, I will conduct a desk review of health services, and analyze interviews with key informants who provide SRH services to understand how services have adapted. Using a sequential exploratory design I will also analyze secondary qualitative and quantitative data to examine how environments have shaped risks for adolescent girls and women who do sex work and how they respond to work related risk.

The results from this study will be shared with community stakeholders, and policy and program leaders from the Center for Public Health of the Ministry of Health in Ukraine to provide evidence for designing effective SRH programs that respond to the changing landscape of wartime. Evidence-based programmatic planning will be necessary for the reconstruction of SRH services in a post-conflict state. This research presents an opportunity for Canadian and Ukrainian researchers to come together to lead cutting edge research on conflict and STBBI."

Child survival has been a focus of worldwide interest. Early child development (ECD) sets the tone for the rest of an individual's life, affecting subsequent life chances through skills development, education, and occupational opportunities.
Investing in ECD must mean equity from the start, Governments should create inter agency mechanisms to provide comprehensive packages that extend to all children, parents, and caregivers. Equal accessibility must be given to boys and girls and including input from children in developing these services. The Human Early Learning Partnership (HELP) has been designated by the WHO as the Global Knowledge Network for ECD to promote equity from the start. We have formed partnerships with experts in various international agencies to conduct a two-fold research & development program. Since it's introduction in 1989, all countries ratifying the Convention on the Right of the Children (CRC) are obligated to submit a periodic report to UNCRC on the status of child rights in their jurisdiction. Improving these reports meant introducing indicators to serve as report writing tools. In 2005, UNCRC empowered HELP to create these indicators. Through 2 years of extensive research, these indicators were developed and we aim to pilot them prior to their consideration as a global tool. Investment in ECD also requires the creation of systems to monitor developmental outcomes, identify avoidable inequalities and mechanisms to point society towards effective programs in enhancing developmental outcomes. Using our experience in Canada and Australia, HELP has built a consortium to support countries in building such systems.We propose a two-fold program of enhancing ECD by facilitating the monitoring and fulfillment of CRC and by building the ECD population level database. We believe that the proposed project is an efficient way to promote heath equity from the start."

Our purpose is to more closely link the health promotion mandates of two community-based indigenous organizations (Head Start Programs and Friendship Centres) in Atlantic Canada with extensive knowledge and experience of promoting Indigenous well-being, with the aim of laying groundwork for a future full NEIHR Network grant proposal. We will also leverage knowledge and relationships that have been built by the Urban Aboriginal Knowledge Network Atlantic over the past five years. 

In phase 1, we will review published literature about promoting the well-being of Indigenous people in Canada. The objective of this review will be to increase our understanding of existing programs and services, to identify sex/gender differences in these services, and identify gaps in the literature. We will also review projects that team members have been involved in to assess our capacity and readiness to develop an Atlantic network for Indigenous health research. 

In phase 2 core team members will participate in two capacity-building activities. The first of these will be a NEIHR Development Workshop, as specified in the Funding Opportunity Details. The second will be an Indigenous Strategic Planning program offered by the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity. 

Phase 3 will be a two-day strategic planning meeting where all team members will collaboratively identify priorities for future research on urban Indigenous well-being in Atlantic Canada and begin to prepare a full NEIHR Network grant.

Ultimately, we expect this project to contribute to a better understanding of urban Indigenous health and well-being in Atlantic Canada."

Moreover, many of their maternal health and birth outcomes are influenced by their ethnic food choices. Research is needed to better understand ethnocultural food choices and practices and to develop and evaluate resources for improving cultural competency of maternity care. In this research study we will ask: How do health beliefs/ practices of immigrant women affect their food choices and practices during the perinatal period? How can current perinatal nutrition recommendations be tailored and delivered as pictorial educational resources to enhance culturally competent perinatal care? Immigrant women in each of three study locations (Edmonton, Saskatoon, and Ottawa), who are pregnant or who have recently delivered their babies, will be invited to participate. They will be asked and trained to take pictures of the foods they consume for a three day period and those that they see as being healthy for maternity. Next, they will be interviewed in relation to these choices and other factors effecting their food choices and practices. With the results from these interviews and subsequent consultations with health care professionals and immigrant support agency workers, we will develop resources which incorporate the women's perspectives into current Canadian nutrition recommendations. A sample of health care professionals and immigrant women will then use the resources and then participate in focus groups to discuss and evaluate them. Wide dissemination of our findings throughout the health professional, public health, and obstetrical communities using multiple formats and media will have great potential to positively affect immigrant maternal and childhood health and well-being."

This is truer for anyone who does not understand or only understands a little English.  If immigrant women cannot use the maternity services that exist, their health and that of their unborn child or infant may suffer in both the short and long term.

All of my research is community-based and led using Indigenous ways of knowing and being, including Indigenous and arts-based methods. However, I have never led, aside from my doctoral research, a research programme. This mentorship workshop will allow me the opportunity to gain useful skills to succeed in conducting good research with and alongside my communities and partners. Additionally, I hope to gain skills which will allow me conduct research which is not only fully community based but can also be recognized within the Western modes of the academy. Up until this point in my career, I have had few Indigenous mentors, aside from my doctoral supervisor, therefore an opportunity to attend this workshop will assist me in being able to expand my network of senior Indigenous researchers who I can connect with to seek guidance as I start my work. I would note that I am the only Indigenous faculty member in the Faculty of Health at York University, so the need to have strong guidance and mentorship not only in research but how to work in a Western academy, cannot be understated."

Social Determinants of Health and Theories of Justice:  What is the normative relation between health inequalities and socio-economic inequalities?  An ethical analysis,"['Hirose, Iwao']","['Eyal, Nir M', 'Segall, SHLOMI']","['Distributive Justice', 'Health Inequalities', 'Health Policy', 'Medical Ethics', 'Population Health', 'Social Determinants Of Health']",80804.0,192788,"Health inequalities exist in every society. Even societies that feature universal and free access to health care display considerable health inequalities. Health inequalities will not be eradicated by simply promoting equal access to health care services. While health is a non-divisible and non-transferable good, it is possible to reduce health inequalities by redistributing other goods, such as income, housing, employment, and workplace autonomy. This idea is known as the social determinants of health (SDH). Health policy-makers take health inequalities to be a matter of social justice, but there is no ethical justification for this judgment. The goal of this project is to offer a novel ethical framework, which we call the luck egalitarian approach, for the promotion of population-wide health through the redistribution of SDH, and to lay out the methodological foundations for a comprehensive theory of SDH in health equity. We will pursue two specific objectives. The first is to reject the theory of justice as applied to SDH, which was proposed by John Rawls and Norman Daniels. The Rawls-Daniels theory of justice is the dominant, and in fact the only, ethical theory on SDH. We will argue that it encounters serious theoretical problems. The second objective is to propose and develop the luck egalitarian approach to SDH and health equity and to show its relative advantages over the Rawls-Daniels theory. Luck egalitarianism contends that justice requires correcting disadvantages for which individuals cannot be held responsible. According to this theory, justice requires reducing health inequalities created by some SDH, but not all SDH. It allows for some health inequalities to exist. The results of this project will introduce a radical paradigm shift in our understanding of SDH and serve as the methodological foundations for our larger, interdisciplinary research program on SDH and health equity in future."

Deliberate gender-targeted alcohol advertising has been identified by health experts as a key driver increasing alcohol use and harms among women. Market research shows the alcohol industry is featuring health-oriented nutrient content claims (e.g., 0g sugar) on the front of select alcoholic beverages as a promotional strategy targeting specific populations, such as women and young adults who may be more responsive to this health-oriented product positioning. Current Canadian regulations prohibit product label statements that are misleading or create an erroneous impression. The use of nutrient content claims to promote the nutritional attributes of select beverages may mislead consumers to believe products with the claims are ""healthier"" than similar products without the claims and consume more. Health warning labels are recommended as a policy tool for communicating health risks to consumers and countering advertising cues. Unlike tobacco or cannabis packs, alcohol containers are not mandated to display a health warning label in Canada. The proposed study will be the first in Canada to test the gender-specific effects of alcohol nutrient content claims and a health warning label on product perceptions and drinking intentions. More specifically, the proposed study will consist of an online survey with Canadian women and men ages 18-45 who drink alcohol to experimentally test if nutrient content claims on alcohol containers influence product perceptions and drinking intentions, and if the influence of these claims differs between women and men. The proposed study will also examine if a health warning label on alcohol containers modifies the influence of nutrient content claims on perceptions and drinking intentions by gender. Should nutrient content claims prove to mislead consumers about the health risks of alcohol, results can inform policy priorities for alcohol labelling in Canada."

However, unlike alcohol, until September 2021, there was no evidence-based, specific advice for people who gamble who wanted to reduce their risk of gambling harms. In 2016, the first large scale international, comprehensive, project to develop evidence based Lower-Risk Gambling Guidelines (LRGGs) began.  In 2021, the LRGG initiative introduced a set of workable, quantitative limits on gambling behaviour. Efforts to disseminate these guidelines to public health, regulations and industry are ongoing. 
Existing frameworks and evidence supporting the evaluation of public health guidelines such as these emphasize the importance of assessing the effectiveness of their implementation, as well as their impact. Assessing impact includes measuring the degree to which desired changes have been achieved at an individual, organizational, community, and population level. The goal of this project is to develop an evaluation framework and methodology for this purpose.   
Three project components are planned: (1) review the academic and grey literature assessing the design, implementation, and evaluation of similar public health guidelines (e.g., alcohol use guidelines, cannabis use guidelines, Canada's food guide, screen time guidelines, etc
(2) a search and review of websites and news, media coverage will be conducted to assess use of LRGGs since their release in 2021. 
(3) qualitative interviews with key informants in Canada and elsewhere on awareness of the lower risk gambling guidelines, their implementation and perceived barriers to implementation.  
The results of the reviews and interviews will be used to develop an outcome framework to evaluate the Lower Risk Gambling Guidelines. We anticipate this theory of change and outcome framework will also be useful in the evaluation of other public health guidelines in the future, both within and outside of the gambling harm reduction field."
Understanding counsellor-client interactions in spinal cord injury exercise counselling: a novel method to explain outcomes of randomized controlled trials by assessing intervention fidelity,"['Hoekstra, Femke']",['N/A'],"['Behavioural Change Theory', 'Behavioural Interventions', 'Dynamic System Methods', 'Exercise Counselling', 'Health Promotion', 'Implementation Science', 'Intervention Fidelity', 'Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial', 'Spinal Cord Injury']",112500.0,412819,"Behavioural interventions often consist of conversations between counsellors and clients and can be a successful way to promote a healthy lifestyle. However, these interventions are not always successfully translated to other real-world settings. A possible reason for this variation in outcomes, is that researchers do not always measure how counsellors and clients interact with each other. Recently, a new method, called state space grids, has been developed to study and visualize how a counsellor and client interact with each other over time. This study will use these state space girds to study conversations about health-enhancing exercise between exercise counsellors and clients with spinal cord injury (SCI) to better understand the frequency, sequence, and duration of behaviour change techniques used in the interaction between the counsellor and client. This study is part of a larger trial of the effects of exercise to reduce chronic pain in adults with SCI. Participants in the study will receive tailored exercise counselling from a trained counsellor. Audio recordings of the counselling sessions will be analysed line-by-line by two researchers. This study is the first to use state space grids methods in an exercise behaviour interventions trial. It will provide new insights into how counsellors and clients with SCI interact with each other. These findings will help us to better understand how, when, and why the counselling sessions are successful or not. The findings can be used to develop training guides for SCI exercise counsellors and can improve SCI exercise counselling. In turn, understanding and improving effective exercise counselling will enhance lives of many Canadians with SCI."

Although many efforts have been made to support global tobacco control, relatively little information is easily available about the nature of the epidemic at a global scale, with most existing databases limited to a small number of countries and years. This lack of readily-available data has impeded efforts to understand the tobacco epidemic and evaluate tobacco control interventions' effects. Many interventions have been shown to be efficacious at a national level, but their global effectiveness has largely been presumed. This project will address these gaps by: 1) systematically reviewing and analyzing global tobacco consumption data available from 1985-2013; 2) developing a publicly available database of these data; 3) analyzing global trends in tobacco consumption across region, income-economy and other stratifying factors; 4) evaluating the conditional effects of the 2003 international tobacco control treaty (FCTC) on state policy and tobacco consumption with a robust quasi-experimental design; 5) estimating the impact of the FCTC on smoking-related deaths; and 6) assessing the cost-effectiveness of the FCTC as measured in per years of life saved.

Months after actress Angelina Jolie announced her decision to have a double mastectomy, studies recorded an increase in the number of high-risk patient screenings for the BRAC1 gene (2). When journalist Katie Couric televised her colonsocopy on NBC’sToday Show, colerectal cancer screenings by 400 American endoscopists increased by 21% the next month (3). These results are just some examples of recent celebrity health advocacy, and it is believed that this phenomenon will continue (4-6).These occurences have concerned health researchers and professionals, as it is unclear what impact celebrities have in shaping health-related knowledge, attitudes, behaviours and policies (7-10). Which health outcomes are influenced by celebrity involvement? How large of a role do celebrities actually play in influencing public health outcomes? Under which circumstances do celebrities produce an impact that is more harmful than beneficial? As these questions remain unanswered, the health advocacy role taken by some celebrities has proven to be a challenge for health researchers and public health authorities alike. This systematic review aims to address these questions by identifying all available evidence in this area, quantifying the impact of celebrity influence through a meta-analysis, and futher analyzing factors that govern this influence through a meta-regression analysis. It is our hope that the outcomes of this review may serve to inform public health authorities on the factors that underlie our health decisions and provide insight as to how we can better engage celebrities and other opinion leaders in productive ways to optimize public health outcomes.References1.Hoffman SJ, Tan C.

To design more effective and equitable international treaties, and maximize impacts for health, we must understand 1) whether, 2) how, and 3) for whom past international treaties have had effects. In Canada, the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of international treaties in facilitating the sharing of scientific information, regulating international supply chains, and incentivizing cooperation in the innovation of tests and treatments. With the ongoing negotiation of a new pandemic treaty and revisions to the International Health Regulations, there has never been a more important moment in which to draw on the best available science to inform the equitable design and implementation of international treaties. In spite of the critical role of international treaties in advancing global health, policymakers primarily draw on personal experience, shared assumptions and intuition to guide the design, negotiation, and implementation of these instruments. Over the last ten years, our team has laid the groundwork for a new scientific approach to understanding whether international treaties work, how they work, and for whom they work. We will conduct a living systematic review and meta-analysis of international treaties, multilevel analyses of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, and quasi-experimental evaluations of the Montreal Protocol to produce open science outputs and policy toolkits. By generating the open-access data, methods, and evidence needed to inform the equitable design of international treaties, we will contribute to designing better treaties that effectively address global collective action problems and make the world a healthier place for all."
"Early Opioid Prescriptions for Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders of the Low Back: Understanding Utilization Patterns, Determinants, and Impact on Work Disability","['Hogg-Johnson, Sheilah', 'Cote, Pierre']","['Carnide, Nancy', 'Furlan, Andrea D', 'Koehoorn, Mieke W']","['Cohort Study', 'Health Care Utilization', 'Low Back Pain', 'Opioids', 'Prescription Patterns', 'Secondary Data', 'Work Disability', ""Workers' Compensation""]",66576.0,227354,"Increasing use of prescription opioids among workers with musculoskeletal disorders, such as back pain, has become a significant source of concern for workers' compensation systems across North America. Clinical practice guidelines for treatment of acute episodes of low back pain suggest a short-course of opioid drugs may be considered for severe pain unresponsive to other pain medications (acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories). However, recent data suggest opioids are being prescribed increasingly earlier after filing a WC claim for work-related low back pain (WRLBP) and that these early opioid prescriptions are leading to prolonged work disability.

A number of methodological limitations are present in these studies that cast doubt on the accuracy of conclusions. The overall objective of the proposed study is to address these limitations and determine whether opioid analgesics prescribed to workers within the first eight weeks of filing a new workers' compensation lost-time claim for WRLBP are associated with future work disability. To inform our main objective, we will also 1) describe patterns of health care received over a two-year period prior to filing the claim, 2) describe patterns of opioid prescriptions over one year following claim and their associated factors, and 3) describe whether opioid prescription patterns have changed since 1998.

We will conduct analyses using data from Population Data BC and PharmaNet in British Columbia. These data are ideal as they provide a rich source of information on important characteristics not considered in prior studies. The findings of this study will provide a more comprehensive picture of opioid prescribing patterns experienced by claimants and their impact on work disability. These findings will be relevant to workers' compensation boards in the development of treatment policies, as well as physicians for guiding their treatment decisions."

Although the number of new HIV infections in BC has decreased significantly in the last few years, rates of infection among MSM, those most affected by HIV, have not decreased as quickly as in other transmission groups. HIV+ people receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) can now expect to live a near-normal life; however, inequities continue to exist in patterns of morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations. My team and I propose to pursue 3 key areas of investigation including: 1) whether treatment optimism arises from BC’s Treatment as Prevention (TasP) policy, focusing upon current HAART and future Post- and Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP+PrEP) and how these influence MSM sexual behavior and infection rates over time; 2) how long-term HAART use affects aging-related comorbidities, especially among vulnerable or hard-to-reach populations; and 3) how different supportive service models of care impact survival and HAART uptake, adherence and retention among HIV+ subgroups.Anticipated results:My research will contribute much needed evidence on the impact of the implementation of policies and services that have expanded access to HAART in BC. The research will identify emergent, clinically-relevant challenges and questions arising in the evolving context of accessible, effective HIV treatments that enable people with HIV to live longer healthier lives. The results will directly impact HIV care primarily through the involvement of health services representatives, as well as through revision of treatment guidelines via well-established lines of communication with clinicians at the BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS (BC CfE) and other international agencies like the World Health Organization and UNAIDS. Overall, my research will continue to inform both the provincial and UNAIDS strategy to end AIDS and drastically reduce the number of new HIV infections worldwide.Core expertise:I am an internationally recognized HIV researcher who, for 22 years, has focused on HIV/AIDS and marginalized populations. I am the Principal Investigator of the Momentum Health Study; the Canadian Observational Cohort Collaboration (CANOC), a CIHR team spanning 14 institutions in 4 provinces, the Comparison of Outcomes And Service Utilization Trends (COAST) study; and 3 community-based research studies conducted in conjunction with the Dr. Peter AIDS Foundation, McLaren Housing Society of BC, and the BC HIV Drug Treatment Program. In addition, as cohort lead with the NA-ACCORD and ART-CC cohort studies, my team and I contribute to international cohort research and have built many productive ongoing partnerships with an extensive team of leading American and European HIV researchers.Mentoring and training activities:My mentoring and training program specializes in training graduate students (MSc, MPH, PhD, and post-docs) and community-based peer-researchers in the fields of epidemiology, cohort research, demography, and community-based research.

The Pacific AIDS Network has identified housing as the most urgent unmet need of PHA in BC. While housing is an area of importance, there is little evidence of its impacts on the health outcomes of PHA. This study will explore the role housing plays in influencing the ability of persons to manage different aspects of their health - such as adherence to medicine, access to nutritious foods, and adequate rest. In order to accurately capture how PHA understand the relationship between housing and health, a unique methodology will be implemented so that the experiences of the participants are included at the onset. This study will use an approach called Photovoice to allow persons to more holistically reflect on their environments. Nine participants will be trained as community researchers (CRs) and will use cameras to capture their social and physical environments. CRs will analyze the photos and generate repetitive themes and ideas, which will be grouped to reflect their views. Photos will be made available to the pubic through an exhibit which will help initiate community dialogue on how housing shapes health. The knowledge gained from the Photovoice project will inform the development of a questionnaire that will examine the effects of housing as an intervention on health at a population level. A 110-unit housing complex is being developed for individuals who are either homeless or at-risk of homelessness and living with HIV. Those enrolled to move into the housing complex will be invited to fill out the questionnaire and will be linked to clinical provincial data at multiple points in time to examine the impact of housing stability on health outcomes."

People living with HIV (PLWH) have been disproportionately affected by substance use disorders and the ongoing OD crisis. As well, PLWH are at increased risk for negative indirect impacts of the pandemic, including increased levels of social isolation, loneliness, stress, anxiety, and substance use. More insight is needed in the extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the occurrence of ODs, as well as the short and long-term health consequences of nonfatal ODs, in PLWH.

We will use routinely collected health data on all PLWH in BC and a random sample of 10% of the general population. First, we will compare the incidence of fatal and NFODs before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, in people living with and without HIV. We will assess the severity of NFODs in terms of hospitalizations, complications, and duration of hospital stay. In addition, we will assess and compare trends in health care utilization and mortality in the six months after a nonfatal OD. Second, based on these analyses, and learning from the perspectives of community experts, health care providers, and policy makers, we will formulate recommendations for the care of PLWH who are at risk for or experienced an OD. These aim to reduce the risk for OD and adverse long-term health outcomes following a NFOD.

This study will provide essential insights into the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the coinciding OD crisis and HIV epidemic. These are urgently needed to inform targeted interventions to mediate the compounding effects of these three ongoing health crises."

Advancing equitable access to diagnostics,"['Horton, Susan']","['Pai, Madhukar']",['Global Health Policy - Towards Universal Health Coverage'],18500.0,411461,"Accurate and timely diagnostic tests are essential for appropriate healthcare treatment. Laboratory tests, pathology tests (using microscopes) and medical imaging (using ultrasound, X-ray or more advanced technologies) are essential for accurate diagnosis. Without accurate diagnostic tests, there can be overuse of antibiotics leading to antimicrobial resistance, inappropriate treatment, wasted healthcare resources, worse health outcomes and, in the extreme, preventable patient deaths. 
Access to diagnostic tests is highly inequitable. Low- and middle-income countries do not yet have broad national health insurance coverage, and households have to pay out of pocket for diagnostic tests. Given resource constraints, patients often accept ""presumptive treatment"" i.e. without a proper diagnosis, in order to reserve their limited funds for treatment. Availability of diagnostic tests is also poorer in more remote and rural locations, leading to geographic inequities in access in all countries.
There are solutions which can help make access to diagnostics more equitable. Point-of-care tests can improve access - as long as they are provided as part of a networked system to ensure tests used are appropriate and of good quality. Increased awareness and advocacy are vital. The World Health Organization's newly-developed Essential Diagnostics List can help to prioritize resources for key tests rather than allowing market forces to dictate availability. Teleradiology and telepathology can help improve access for more remote communities. International markets can be ""shaped"" to ensure a pipeline of affordable tests for low-resource environments

A Spatiotemporal Analysis of the Effect of Vancouver's Bikeway Network on Commuting to Work by Bicycle,"['Hosford, Katherine A']",['N/A'],['Ipph Travel Awards'],1500.0,418150,"Between 1996 and 2016, Vancouver made substantial investments to their bikeway network, adding over 200 km of bikeways for a total network of 291 km. This investment corresponded with increases in city-wide bicycle commuting: nearly a doubling from 3.3% in 1996 to 6.1% in 2016. Despite high investment in bicycle infrastructure and a growing bicycling mode share, no work to date has examined the long-term effect of bicycle infrastructure on commuting to work by bicycle. This study aims to understand whether residential access to bikeways in Vancouver influenced commuting to work by bicycle, and whether the type of bikeway implemented (local street bikeway, painted bike lane, protected bike lane) makes a difference. Over the 20-years, the proportion of commuters bicycling to work increased by 3.2%, with the largest growth concentrated around the downtown core. The proportion of neighbourhoods with any bicycle infrastructure increased from half in 1996 to nearly all neighbourhoods in 2016. We found that changes in the amount of local street bikeways in the residential neighbourhood were associated with bicycling to work, but changes in the amount of painted bike lanes or protected bike lanes were not. Our study provides insight into the effect of large-scale investments made by the City to encourage cycling, an important contribution to guide future investments."

Access to transportation is essential for older adults to connect with family and friends, and to access health care services, recreational opportunities, and other essential goods and services. And yet the current transportation system is not designed to meet the day-to-day needs of the aging population. Transportation problems are one of the most common barriers, after health problems, that prevent older Canadians from participating in more social, recreational, or group activities. United Way Healthy Aging is working closely with the community-based seniors' services sector to bring solutions to seniors' transportation. Through the Better at Home program, United Way Healthy Aging supports a network of over 80 agencies across the province to deliver seniors' transportation services, typically in the form of seniors' shuttles, buses, and volunteer driver programs. One challenge to advancing transportation programming in this sector, and the non-profit sector more generally, is limited capacity to locate, collect, and analyze data which can be used to quantify the scale of problems, inform where efforts should be targeted, and advocate for change. In this fellowship, I will bridge this data gap by analyzing data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging - the largest and longest multi-year study on aging. The results of this project will support United Way Healthy Aging's efforts to deliver effective transportation programming to older adults in the community. This project will also support larger strategic goals of provincial and federal health agencies to shift away from hospital-based models of care to community-based models, as community-based models are both cheaper for the health system and what most older adults prefer."
The association between religious participation and cognitive function,"['Hosseini, Sheri']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,383022,"Preserving cognitive health is a crucial aspect of successful aging.

Religious involvement has been shown to have a positive impact on cognitive function through its effect on physical and mental health. This research aims to investigate the association between religious service participation and cognitive function among middle- and old-age adults. This study will be conducted at the population-level and will include quantitative analyses of baseline data from over 50,000 individuals aged between 45 to 85 years, who were recruited as part of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA). The quantitative analyses will be supplemented and enhanced with qualitative data obtained from interviewing members of religious communities, including pastors and parishioners. The qualitative component will allow for the interpretation of the quantitative results by persons who are characteristically similar to the CLSA participants. 
The findings from this thesis will help identify whether higher frequencies of participation in religious activities are positively associated with better cognitive function among middle- and older-aged persons in Canada. The results will suggest whether encouraging continued religious practices among persons who profess a religious faith could serve as a health promotion strategy in the realm of cognitive function."

Methods: We used baseline telephone interview data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) and the Kruskal-Wallis test to examine the relationship between the frequency of religious participation and cognitive function. Religious participation was measured categorically: at least once a day, at least once a week, at least once a month, at least once a year, never. Three tests measured cognitive function: the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Mental Alternation Test, and Animal Fluency Test. A p-value < 0.005 was considered statistically significant after applying the Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.
Preliminary Results: The mean age of the CLSA participants was 63 years. The majority of participants reported never participating in religious activity (47.5%). Forty-nine percent of the participants were male. We detected several statistically significant pair-wise comparisons (p < 0.005) for each of the cognitive tests (e.g., at least once a week vs. at least once a year); however, the data did not show any particular trends or patterns. 
Next Steps: We will conduct regression analyses examining cognitive outcomes singularly and combined to assess the association between religious participation and cognitive function, controlling for age, sex, education, place of residence, and social engagement. We will repeat the analyses longitudinally when the CLSA releases three-year follow-up data."

Although smoking remains the single most important factor leading to lung cancer, only 15% of smokers eventually develop the disease. Therefore, much remains to be understood and it is clear that other modifiable lifestyle factors could influence our risk of developing lung cancer. This research focuses on identifying lifestyle behaviours that men and women can change in order to prevent lung cancer. 

Regular physical activity is one of the most important things we can do for our health. In fact, being physically active has been shown to decrease the risk of some cancers. There are many different types of of physical activity that a person may be involved in, including activity conducted at work and for recreational purposes. This research is the first to investigate whether work-place physical activity measured across the entire working life and engagement in recreational physical activity influences a person's risk of developing lung cancer in later life.

Project Description: Our research is based on an existing study that was conducted between 1996 and 2001 in Montreal, Quebec. The study included 1,136 men and women newly diagnosed with lung cancer, and 1,457 people without lung cancer that were chosen to represent Montreal area residents who were at risk of developing lung cancer. In an interview, people were asked to recall participation in recreational physical activity 20 years ago. For work-place physical activity, participants were asked the main tasks that they performed for all jobs in their entire working life. The amount of work-place physical activity for each job was then assigned by a panel of experts. 

Impact and Relevance: There are many opportunities to prevent lung cancer; the more that we understand about factors that may cause cancers or prevent cancer from occurring in the first place will allow us to ultimately improve the health of Canadians."

Men are more likely to develop colorectal cancer than women. Different environmental, lifestyle and biologic factors may explain this risk difference. Also, research is uncovering the role of estrogen, a hormone that promotes the development and maintenance of female characteristics, in preventing colorectal cancer development in women.
Less is known of the role of hormones in the development of colorectal cancer in men. Similar to the evidence in women, there is support that the proper functioning of sex hormones may prevent the onset of colorectal cancer in men. Endocrine disruptors are chemicals that interferes with the proper functioning of sex hormones. We are exposed to these chemicals in the environment and in diet; however, workers in certain sectors are highly exposed to endocrine disruptors.
In this research, we will examine whether exposure to endocrine disruptors in the workplace increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer. Our research will be based on an ongoing Canadian study that began in 2009. This study included men and women who have volunteered to share information on their health, lifestyle, environment and behaviours. Our research will include all men and women who were newly diagnosed with colorectal cancer since 2009. For comparison, we will select a sub-group of people, who have not had cancer at the beginning of the study. The interview asked detailed questions on the longest-held job for all participants. Using this information, we will determine whether exposure to endocrine disruptors at the longest held job was probable or not. We will compare the number of colorectal cancer cases among participants who were probably exposed to endocrine disruptors to those who were never exposed. This study offers a valuable opportunity to examine, in a short time frame and at low cost, whether endocrine disruptors play an important role in colorectal cancer risk."

This project proposes to respond to these needs through two specific components 1) a youth-engaged construction of a website to disseminate perspectives that were gathered during the initial research, and 2) a series of meetings between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal health and social service providers to review and assess strategies to incorporate results of the research into practices that support the development of more efficient better quality services aimed at the prevention and management of diabetes within the Aboriginal community. These activities will be the subject of an evaluation plan aimed at assessing the format of the knowledge translation activity in relation to increased awareness, empowerment and engagement of Aboriginal youth in diabetes prevention action; to evaluate the impact, value, access, and format of the research findings and other resources for visitors to the website; and to evaluate the feasibility of translation of the research data into action in the second activity aimed at overall Aboriginal health research capacity building and ongoing processes to improve the delivery of services and health of the Aboriginal community."
Quantifying Burden of Surgical Disease and Improving Access to Surgical Care in India,"['Hsiao, Marvin']",['N/A'],"['Access To Health Care', 'Burden Of Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Global Health', 'Low- And Middle-Income Countries', 'Public Health', 'Surgery', 'Survey Methodology']",70000.0,257457,"Background: Surgery has been long neglected on the global public health agenda. Surgical diseases, including injuries, cancer, maternal and congenital conditions, are largely treatable but cause a disproportionately large amount of disability and death in developing countries. In order for surgical care to be part of a comprehensive healthcare system in developing countries, additional research is required to better quantify and characterize surgical diseases and the barriers affecting access to surgical care. 
Methods: In 1998, the Government of India and the Centre for Global Health Research at the University of Toronto launched the Million Death Study (MDS) - a nationally representative survey of 2.4 million households across India over a 17-year period that records the cause of death along with demographics and coexisting health problems. By combining the MDS database with a survey to capture the clinical experience of Indian surgeons, we aim to provide accurate estimates of the burden of surgical disease in India. We will also use the MDS database to characterize specific surgical diseases, including detailed descriptive epidemiology of road traffic injury deaths. To identify barriers affecting access to surgical care, we will use a geospatial approach to analyze the MDS database in conjunction with an Indian health facility database. We will study the relationship between surgical disease distribution, location of health facilities, and surgical capacity of health facilities. 
Impact of Research: The novel methodologies and tools developed in our research can generate much needed data to support the inclusion of surgical care into a comprehensive global public health plan. These methodologies are scalable and can be adapted to other resource-poor settings."
DemoPredict: Using linked accelerometry data to predict incident dementia in older Canadians,"['Hsu, Amy T', 'Manuel, Douglas G', 'Tanuseputro, Peter']","['Colley, Rachel C', 'Wilson, Kumanan']","['Activity Trackers', 'Multimorbidity', 'Predictive Models', 'Prevention', 'Wearable Technology Devices']",100000.0,418533,"Multimorbidity is rising in the Canadian population. According to data from the Public Health Agency of Canada's Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System (CCDSS), the proportion of Canadians aged 40 years and over living with three or more chronic conditions increased by 50% between 2001/02 and 2011/12. Many chronic diseases - such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease [CVD] and dementia - share the same underlying pathology and modifiable risk factors (e.g., physical inactivity, poor diet, alcohol consumption, cigarette smoking). Despite this, there are currently few existing tools that can be used to inform public health interventions aimed at reducing multimorbidity by targeting individuals' behaviours. Strategies for disease prevention and management centred on common risk factors across related diseases could improve the overall effectiveness of intervention programs.

Among the many shared risk factors across non-communicable chronic diseases, diet, alcohol consumption and physical activity are a few of the largest contributors to the incidence of these conditions. However, existing predictive models relying on self-reported exposure to health risks generally results in an underestimation of risk burden and a source of bias in such studies. There are now opportunities to improve interventions centre-around physical inactivity with the use of new technologies and data sources. Fitness technology, including activity trackers and smartphone applications, has become increasingly popular for measuring and encouraging physical activity in recent years.

In this project, we will develop a predictive algorithm of multimorbidity using linked survey and administration data; assess the receptivity to and potential use of activity trackers for disease prevention in older adults; and create a web-based tool (called GaitWay) that has the capacity to use individuals' data from activity trackers to predict their risk for multimorbidity."

It is not clear, however, how health care use and health outcomes of individuals living with dementia are influenced by care setting and by how quickly individuals move between care settings. This study will describe the places where individuals with dementia receive care, compare the health care use (e.g., home care, palliative care) and health outcomes (e.g., days in hospital, location of death, falls, daily pain) across places of care and estimate the future population burden of dementia care. We will also develop tools to allow policy makers to use this information to inform health resource planning and empower patients, families, and caregivers to make informed decisions about patient care. Results of this study will help inform strategies to improve the living and dying experience of this vulnerable population."
Building a culture of vaccine confidence in priority populations: identification and adaptation of strategies to increase vaccine coverage in long-term care workers for future health emergencies,"['Hsu, Amy T', 'Heer, Carrie', 'Presseau, Justin']","['Gartshore, Kerry', 'Corace, Kimberly M', 'Kothari, Anita R', 'Little, Julian', 'Manuel, Douglas G', 'McGeer, Allison J', 'Meyer, Samantha', 'Nilormi, Adhiba', 'Thavorn, Kednapa', 'Welch, Vivian A', 'Wilson, Kumanan']","['Behavioural Science', 'Evidence Synthesis', 'Immunization', 'Implementation Science', 'Long-Term Care']",125000.0,506666,"The 2023 Chief Public Health Officer of Canada's report underscored the need to understand, collaborate with, and support healthcare workers. Among the environments in healthcare most affected by the pandemic was long-term care (LTC), which was at the epicentre of the pandemic's acute impacts. 

In LTC environments, residents and staff regularly come into contact with transmissible yet preventable diseases due to their dependency on hands-on care and sharing of living spaces, and vaccination remains the single most effective public health measure protecting individuals and vulnerable populations against several infectious respiratory illnesses. Yet, despite the promises of mRNA technology for rapid production of highly efficacious vaccines, the impact that vaccines could have on population health is limited by low rates of uptake. This is especially true in LTC, where wide variation in vaccination rates between centres continues to be observed and falls short of public health targets.

The suboptimal vaccination rates among LTC workers are rooted in various barriers to uptake. These barriers exist at the personal, professional, organizational, and system levels. While many strategies have been tried in LTC settings to encourage vaccine uptake, evidence around the implementation, impact and effectiveness of such strategies to improve vaccine uptake remains limited due to a lack of rigorous and formal evaluation in this setting.  

In this project, we propose to (1) conduct a systematic review of strategies for supporting vaccine uptake in healthcare staff in LTC settings to provide a set of evidence-informed options for LTC organizations to consider when planning future vaccination programs for their staff; and (2) co-design, with LTC operators, staff, and policy- and decision-makers to review and tailor their vaccination programs based on evidence-informed strategies that can be successfully implemented in the Canadian context."

Some TB patients have bacteria that are not killed by our standard anti-TB drugs; these bacteria are referred to as drug-resistant. If patients receive the wrong drugs, they are more likely to die. The number of patients who die during treatment is an important indicator of how well a TB treatment program is working so it is critical that we report this number accurately. However, sometimes up to 20% of patients will stop coming to see the doctor during treatment because they moved or did not want to keep taking the drugs because of side effects etc. I will investigate how to accurately report the number of TB patients who died by correcting for patients who stopped coming to the doctor. I will compare two different correction methods using simulated data and then apply the best method to drug-resistant TB patient data from the Philippines. This project will help researchers and TB programs accurately estimate the number of TB patients who died so they can better measure TB quality of care."
A Stepping-Stone Towards Equity: Identifying Key Elements of Best-Practise Guidelines for Improving Sex and Gender-Based Analysis in Cancer Research,"['Huerne, Katherine']",['N/A'],"['Cancer', 'Data Analysis', 'Database', 'Delphi Study', 'Gender', 'Guidelines', 'Knowledge Synthesis', 'Public Health Policy', 'Sex', 'Systematic Review']",105000.0,496811,"Understanding the impact of sex and gender in cancer research is crucial as it can influence how cancer develops, how it's diagnosed, and how treatments work. However, the way these factors are analyzed is not always rigorous, or well-reported. This can limit the usefulness of cancer studies. For example, researchers often don't define what they mean by ""sex"" (as biological attributes) or ""gender"" (as social norms). Many studies also fail to separate the effects of sex apart from other factors like age, which is important for accurate statistical analysis. Most importantly, studies often don't discuss gender-based factors that could be associated with differences in prognosis or treatment effectiveness. The current guidelines for sex/gender analysis are too general and don't address these nuances for the cancer context.

This project aims to fill this gap by creating evidence-based guidelines for analyzing sex and gender differences across different contexts of cancer research. First, existing policy guidelines will be reviewed to understand how sex and gender data are used in lab research, clinical research, and health data records. Then, a structured survey will be conducted with experts in cancer research or sex/gender-based analysis from various international and Canadian institutions. Survey questions will probe for methodological limitations of analyzing sex and gender data, such as how sex can be properly separated from gender effects in statistical analysis. Special attention will be given to developing fair data analysis practices from an intersectional approach, by incorporating considerations of gender norms/sexism, race/racism, and sex and gender minorities, like intersex or transgender individuals. This project addresses a growing need to improve sex/gender analysis from an interdisciplinary approach of integrating scientific, clinical, and social perspectives. In doing so, it can improve the quality and usefulness of cancer research as a whole."
Creating a Positive Health Equity Action Plan: Exploring the impact of privilege on the clinical health outcomes of Canadians living with HIV and the creation of a community-informed positive health equity action plan,"['Hui, Christian']",['N/A'],"['Action Plan', 'Clinical Health Outcomes', 'Critical Epidemiology', 'Health Equity', 'Health Policy', 'Meaningful Engagement Of People Living With Hiv', 'People Living With Hiv', 'Population Health', 'Privilege', 'Viral Suppression']",150000.0,415891,"The exploration of how the social sciences construct of privilege in public and clinical health impacts health outcomes is unique, timely, and fills an existing knowledge gap. Privilege occurs when specific groups possess rights or gains advantage over other groups causing social inequality (Mullaly, 2010). My proposed two-part mixed-methods study aims to explore the impact of privilege on the clinical health outcomes of people living with HIV within the CANOC dataset and the creation of a community-informed plan of action on health equity for Canadians living with HIV. As a community-informed research, an advisory group with members from socially less privileged groups will be formed to provide guidance. The privileged group within the CANOC cohort has been operationalized as White MSM (WMSM) living with HIV. This categorization is based on the literature on whiteness (DiAngelo, 2012; Kwate & Goodman, 2014) and the privilege in health access and health outcomes as experienced by WMSM (Moupali, 2010; Grace, Jollimore, MacPherson, Strang, & Tan, 2018; Raboud et al., 2010). Phase 1 of the study will explore if the social science construct of ""privilege"" (Du Bois,1903) correlates to clinical health outcomes of people living with HIV in Canada's largest HIV cohort dataset utilizing a critical epidemiology approach (Edelman, 2018). I hypothesize that ""privilege"" is correlated with clinical health outcomes of Canadians living with HIV whereby less privileged groups will have poorer clinical health outcomes. Phase 2 utilizes a community-informed approach to engage key stakeholders including people living with HIV from marginalized groups in an online critical health policy roundtable to develop policy recommendations and a sustainable health equity action plan. The study's findings will produce evidence-based recommendations on how Canada can meet the global targets to end HIV through realizing health equity among the diverse communities of Canadians living with HIV."

Routine childhood vaccinations (RCVs) protect children against life-changing illnesses. Kids new to Canada often have incomplete vaccinations as RCV is not part of routine immigration medical examination, the Canadian schedule differs from the WHO schedule, and documentation practices vary. Combined with recent reductions in access to primary care clinics, pharmacies, and schools, these factors may put this group at higher risk of not having access to or not wanting RCVs.

We aim to examine this pandemic's effects on access to RCVs, attitudes about RCVs, and vaccination-seeking behaviours-specifically for kids new to Canada (in the past five years).
Our study will have three components:
1.Environmental scan and scoping review: examining current knowledge of how the pandemic has affected RCV uptake, access, knowledge, and attitudes. This will also include interventions that jurisdictions have begun to implement to address these gaps.
2.Primary data collection: surveys, focus groups, and interviews involving key stakeholders (newcomers, public health, school boards, community organizations) to understand how the pandemic has affected RCV uptake, knowledge, and attitudes. We will also utilize administrative data.
3.Identifying potential interventions: we will identify potential interventions to improve RCV uptake in conjunction with discussion with stakeholders so that they may implement them alongside governmental organizations.
Getting this population on track with RCVs will require strategies that are practical and agreeable to those impacted by them. The process of creating these plans will ensure fairness in the planned projects, the behavioural changes sought, and the goals of improved public health. We expect that this process will help to determine what types of interventions may be most beneficial now and in future public health crises."

In this proposal, I focus on predicting individual's risk for lung and pancreatic cancers, two extremely fatal cancers. 

Specifically, my goals are:

1.To study DNA changes in the peripheral blood that reflects the presence of tumors: This will allow tumor to be detected at a very early stage, before clinical symptoms, while it is still curable by resection. We have identified specific DNA changes that reflect the presence of pancreatic tumor. We will test this in the samples collected before cancer diagnosis and evaluate how early these tumor changes become detectable in the blood.  We will extend this work to lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer deaths. 

2.To develop and validate a comprehensive risk prediction algorithm for lung and pancreatic cancer, including patient's medical history and molecular profiles (such as tumor DNA changes detectable in the blood). The model will be developed and tested in independent studies. The goal is to identify the high-risk individuals for intensive surveillance. 

3.To develop and validate a parsimonious and practical prediction algorithm for the malignancy of pulmonary nodules: Low-dose computed tomography (CT) screening was shown to reduce lung cancer deaths by 20-40%, and it was considered to be an appealing alternative. For those who would be eligible for CT, we will establish an algorithm to differentiate malignant from benign nodules by incorporating health history, imaging features and targeted molecular profiles. This algorithm will reduce unnecessary work-up (and patient anxiety).

4.To test the trans-ethnic generalizability of the prediction models: We will test how well the risk prediction algorithm work across ethnic groups and optimize it for the Canadian population."

There remain significant and varied obstacles to the provision of effective treatment and prevention programs globally.  The challenge of treatment and prevention is amplified in regions that have experienced a humanitarian emergency or natural disaster.  Humanitarian crises result in instability of security, population migration, and heightened vulnerability for individuals and communities. Health care professionals who work for humanitarian medical organizations are frequently involved in providing testing and treatment for HIV/AIDS in crisis settings, as well as initiating programs to prevent disease transmission. In the course of these activities, complex ethical challenges arise for clinicians. In the present inquiry, I will examine organizational, interagency and intergovernmental policies, as well as codes and guidelines, that aim to guide HIV/AIDS-related interventions in crisis settings. I will evaluate normative and legal dimensions of these guidelines and policies. A core objective of this research will be to develop an ethics framework that responds to this domain of health practice, and is applicable for orienting policies that seek to guide practitioners and organizations."

There is growing recognition, however, that we should try to prevent all deaths to new mothers deaths, not just those that fit into the conventional definition of a maternal death. 

The first step towards preventing maternal deaths from motor vehicle crashes is to understand if, when, and which women are at increased risk of motor vehicle accidents in pregnancy or shortly after delivery. We propose to do this by linking British Columbia motor vehicle collision claims records with the province's population health databases, including the British Columbia Perinatal Data Registry, which will provide us with pregnancy-related information. We will compare a woman's risk of being in a motor vehicle crash during pregnancy compared with other women in the province who weren't pregnant, and to the same woman a year prior to her pregnancy to determine if women are more likely to have a motor vehicle accident when pregnant. We will examine if certain pregnancy-related conditions, such as twin pregnancies or anemia (both of which could make a woman more fatigued) increase the risk of a motor vehicle crash."

Spécifiquement, les caractéristiques démographiques et socioéconomiques, les habitudes de consommation d'alcool et de drogues, les comportements lors de la conduite automobile, les caractéristiques psychologiques, l'influence des amis, les croyances et les perceptions par rapport à la conduite sous l'effet du cannabis, ainsi que les raisons motivant cette action, seront étudiés à partir de questionnaires. Les participants seront recrutés par les médias sociaux et répondront aux questions à partir d'un site de sondage en ligne. Ces connaissances, une fois recueillies, analysées et interprétées, permettront de développer les programmes de sensibilisation, de prévention et d'intervention afin qu'ils soient les plus adaptés pour la population canadienne et qu'ils se basent sur les données scientifiques les plus récentes."

Homelessness Action Plans are sets of policies and programs at the municipal or provincial level that have the stated goal of ending or reducing homelessness. A number of Canadian cities have recently developed their own Homelessness Action Plans, which can be considered a type of ""population health intervention.""

Homeless people are among the most marginalized groups in society, and they suffer from many serious threats to their health. The objective of this Programmatic Research Grant is to conduct a series of conceptually linked projects that will examine population health interventions to reduce homelessness and improve health in different regions in Canada. The research program will focus on three interrelated streams:(1) an environmental scan of homelessness action plans, housing policies, housing programs, and health care services for homeless people; (2) an evaluation of the effects of specific housing policies and programs, and their interaction with health care delivery systems, on residential stability and health status among homeless individuals; and (3) an assessment of the effectiveness of knowledge translation strategies related to Housing First and other support housing programs.

This program will take advantage of opportunities to conduct observational research in major urban centres (Vancouver, Calgary, Toronto, and Ottawa) as programs and policies are enacted. Comparative analyses will be performed where there are differences across jurisdictions in policies, program implementation, and health care systems related to the homeless population. Through these systematic and critical comparisons, we will aim to identify crucial factors that can inform methodological innovations in housing, health services, and knowledge translation for the benefit of homeless populations."

People experiencing homelessness face disproportionate physical, mental, and social burdens, risk factors for poor outcomes if infected with COVID-19. Those living in shelters are at higher risk for contracting COVID-19 because of shared living spaces, crowding, difficulty physical distancing, and high population turnover. Once infected with COVID-19, people experiencing homelessness have a higher likelihood of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, or death than the general population. Given increased risk for exposure and serious infection, homeless individuals who live in congregate settings are a priority population for the vaccine rollout in Canada. However, vaccination rates among people experiencing homelessness are historically lower than the general population, linked in part to vaccine misinformation and mistrust of healthcare systems and providers. No Canadian studies have yet investigated COVID-19 vaccine uptake and hesitancy among this population. This qualitative study will explore reasons for COVID-19 vaccine uptake and hesitancy among people experiencing homelessness. Over 3 months, we will interview a diverse group of up to 40 homeless individuals living in physical distancing hotels and emergency shelters in Toronto, to better understand opinions, beliefs, and attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine. This study will be conducted at MAP Centre for Urban Health Solutions and leverages existing partnerships with City of Toronto and Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness. Findings will be rapidly communicated to our public health partners to develop more targeted interventions and strategies to improve vaccination rates among homeless individuals.

Research suggests that early contact with infections lowers the risk of this cancer, while delayed contact with infections increases the risk. However, past research on infection history and the risk of pediatric ALL has not made this relationship clear, often falling short because infection history is difficult to capture at all points of a child's life. Linking a population-based pediatric cancer registry called the Pediatric Oncology Group of Ontario Networked Information System with health administrative data held at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences will allow for the complete assessment of infection history on the risk of pediatric ALL. I have four specific aims: 1) Validate physician diagnoses for infections in health administrative databases; 2) Assess whether mild or severe physician-diagnosed infections are related to pediatric ALL; 3) Explore the age at which the infections occur; and 4) Explore specific groups of infectious agents on the risk of ALL. The proposed study will provide a new and improved approach to answer a previously unanswered question. This study will act as the foundation for future studies that will unite genetic, individual, social, cultural and environmental risk factors to fully understand how these factors interact with each other and how they are related to the development of pediatric ALL."
The role of research evidence in the regulation of risk behaviours: Implications for public health,"['Hyshka, Elaine']",['N/A'],"['Cannabis', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Mixed Methods', 'Public Health Policy', 'Risk Behaviours', 'Tobacco']",105000.0,206143,"The creation of new research knowledge often does not lead on its own to innovations in Canada's health care system and improvements to population health. However, recent efforts on the part of researchers and policy and decision makers have resulted in a more direct translation of Canadian health research evidence into changes designed to improve both the health care system and patient care. Despite these successes, there are still improvements to be made for translating research evidence into health policy and practice. In particular, Canadian public health policy could benefit from increased research evidence input. This is demonstrated by current policies and interventions for addressing risk behaviours, (e.g. substance use and unsafe sex). Although there have been successes in some risk behaviour policy areas, such as evidence-based changes for reducing tobacco use and lowering its economic, health and social costs, some areas, like cannabis policy are less effective for addressing high use rates. The proposed project aims to build an understanding of how to better incorporate public health research evidence into public policy by comparing a successful public health policy area--tobacco--to a less successful policy area--cannabis. This comparative study will use historical, qualitative, and quantitative data to understand how policymakers in each field have (or have not) applied relevant research evidence in their work. These two case studies will be used to develop strategies for improving the translation of research into cannabis and other risk behaviour policy changes. Increasing the translation of research evidence into public health policy is the first step for building more effective interventions for addressing issues like substance use in Canada and improving the overall health of the Canadian population."
Advancing a public health approach to substance use through engaged research and advocacy,"['Hyshka, Elaine']",['N/A'],"['Engaged Scholarship', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health Systems', 'Injection Drug Use', 'Mixed Method Research', 'Overdose', 'Policy Analysis', 'Structural Vulnerability', 'Substance Use']",12500.0,418472,"The overdose epidemic is a defining public health crisis of our time, and the product of multiple policy and system failures, compounded by stigma and discrimination against people who use drugs and those living with substance use disorders. Reversing it requires reallocating resources away from criminalization and carceral systems towards a public health approach that centres individuals' rights, dignity, and health, and mitigates structural factors that create and shape inequitable distributions of substance-related harm. My program of engaged scholarship aims to achieve this societal shift. In 2016, I was appointed Assistant Professor at the University of Alberta's School of Public Health and Scientific Director of the Inner City Health and Wellness Program at the Royal Alexandra Hospital. Core components of my work have included epidemiological and implementation science studies supporting supervised consumption services scale up across Alberta and Canada, and novel applied research optimizing harm reduction services-widely implemented public health interventions in community settings-for the acute care context. I have advised municipal, provincial, federal, and US governments; health authorities; and civil society organizations on substance use issues, and have held a number of leadership positions that directly influenced public health policy and practice change. I prioritize opportunities to mentor students with diverse backgrounds, and regularly engage in capacity building activities that support people who use drugs and their families in advocating for public health solutions that reduce substance-related harm and promote health equity."

The objective of this study is therefore to conduct a global assessment of indoor and outdoor air pollution exposures and their associations with cardiovascular and respiratory disease. I will use data from the Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiological (PURE) study, which includes 153,996 adults residing in 628 communities in 17 low, middle, and high-income countries. I will conduct outdoor air pollution exposure assessments for these communities using state-of-the-art satellite-based methods in combination with Geographic Information Systems and will assess indoor air pollution using household-level measures of solid fuel use collected in the PURE questionnaire. Analyses will examine associations between these air pollution exposure estimates and individual measures of cardiovascular and respiratory disease, after accounting for other known or suspected risk factors. This research will provide a seminal global analysis of air pollution and cardiovascular and respiratory disease that will address a substantial gap in the existing literature, contribute to enhancing global burden of disease estimates, and identify potential susceptible populations."

This catalyst proposal seeks to find narrative evidence of these and emerging dimensions of empowerment, coping, management, and resilience from the point of view of people living with HIV who have HAND.

Data will be analysed and interpreted with triangulation and grounded theorizing and using the collaborative DEPICT model for participatory qualitative analysis by Nixon and Flicker (2014) that includes up to four persons living with HIV as peer researchers in both cities. A knowledge translation and exchange (KTE) process by and for persons living with HIV/AIDS, frontline workers in community based organizations, policy makers, and public health services; at least two community events (i.e., café scientifique) will be implemented.

Intersectionality and the social and structural determinants of health: a mixed methods study exploring the experiences of Black people in Canada with type 2 diabetes,"['Iduye, Damilola']",['N/A'],"['Black Health', 'Mixed Methods Design', 'Social Determinants Of Health', 'Structural Determinants Of Health', 'Type 2 Diabetes']",105000.0,475665,"Type 2 diabetes is one of the fastest-growing global health emergencies of the 21st century, with a disproportionately high prevalence rate in Black Canadian populations. In Canada, Black adults have more than six times the prevalence rate of type 2 diabetes than their White counterparts. Evidence suggests that Black people experience social and health inequities embedded in larger historical, geographical, sociocultural, economic, and political contexts. Most importantly, racism and discrimination can result in poorer health outcomes for Black people. Despite efforts to address the health and social inequities facing Black people, little is known about how broader social contexts shape Black Canadians' health in relation to type 2 diabetes. Therefore, the proposed study will address this gap by exploring how broader social structures and systems shape the experiences of Black people in Canada with type 2 diabetes. A sample of 300 adults with type 2 diabetes from the North End Community Health Centre (NECHC) in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and the TAIBU Community Health Centre (TAIBU) in Toronto, Ontario, will be invited to participate in a survey. Also, up to 30 adults from the 300 hundred participants from the NECHC and TAIBU will be interviewed to understand how broader social structures and health systems intersect to shape their experiences and to elicit recommendations for culturally appropriate type 2 diabetes interventions. This study will elicit recommendations for the development of interventions and resources intended to address the social and structural factors that impact Black Canadians living with type 2 diabetes. Ultimately, the findings will inform the development, implementation, and evaluation of equity-informed policies and interventions for healthcare providers and policy decision-makers that are aimed at combating the increasing burden of type 2 diabetes in this population."

We are working with a particular First Nation whose members are at risk for a familial AD that occurs around age 50.  Some members inherit a unique genetic mutation that leads to AD. In the face of predictive genetic testing, the need for culturally relevant information is even more pressing.
Most Canadian resources explain AD as a brain illness, but this explanation does not align with Indigenous worldviews that balance physical, emotional, mental and spiritual wellness. We anticipate that culturally relevant informational resources based on Indigenous concepts of wellness and illness will improve the understanding of AD prediction, diagnosis, and care. We will work with members of this Nation to:
1. Elucidate how members explain AD within a holistic framework that values both scientific knowledge and traditional teachings. To do this, we will facilitate Sharing Circles and Family Interviews with members of this Nation, and we will interpret the findings in collaboration with the research participants.
2. Synthesize the findings in a preliminary report and, through an iterative process with the community, discuss and further interpret the results. 
3. Create a final resource report that leads to improved understanding of AD prediction, diagnosis, and care for members of the Nation, clinicians, academics and policy makers.

With new medications, HIV has been successfully transformed from a fatal to a chronic illness. However, medical/health related HIV outcomes are often complicated by complex comorbid mental health issues (e.g., depression). Depression is a major problem for many PHAs, and interpersonal relationships have a significant impact on depression. Therefore, researchers are encouraging future research to include aspects of attachment (i.e., reflections of interpersonal behaviour and emotion regulation) in therapeutic HIV interventions and to examine potential links between attachment, mental health and HIV medical treatments. Yet, there is limited research on attachment styles among PHAs. The objective of this research is to advance our understanding of the role of attachment styles for PHAs. First, I will examine the distribution of attachment styles among PHAs, and the relationship between insecure attachment and depression. Next I will determine how comorbid insecure attachment style and depression impacts: adherence to HIV treatment interventions; medication adherence; smoking behaviour; quality of life, and CD4/viral loads among PHAs. The sample will consist of PHAs who completed a HIV treatment adherence intervention, and PHAs who completed a HIV Quit Smoking psychological intervention. Participants receive several treatment sessions and complete measures of attachment, depression, quality of life, medication adherence and immunological functioning (i.e., CD4 counts, viral loads) at multiple time points. This research will help clinicians, physicians, and PHAs understand how emotional and interpersonal patterns influence health. Understanding how insecure attachment styles and depression interact will improve current treatment protocols for PHAs in Canada, and will serve to advocate for the importance of addressing comorbid mental health conditions in PHAs."

There is a growing body of literature addressing the sexual and romantic experiences of (heterosexual and cisgender) people with disabilities. However, this literature has not paid equal attention to the experiences of disabled people who identify as LGBT+. In addition, the community partner for this project (Inclusion Lethbridge) has raised the concern that LGBT+ disabled people, who are now more likely to be living in the community rather than in segregated care, might lack the tools necessary to grasp their gender and sexual identities and develop and maintain intimate relationships. To address this gap, this study will conduct semi-structured, in-depth qualitative interviews with 15-30 adults labeled/with developmental and intellectual disabilities about 1)  their experiences in constructing their sexual and gender identities, 2) their knowledge and needs related to sexual health, and 3) their experiences navigating LGBT+ spaces. The interviews will be done in person, via Zoom or telephone, depending on the participant's preference, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. The disability rights movement has long fought for ""nothing about us, without us"" (Charlton, 1998) - this includes active and meaningful participation in disability research. There is a need for health and community professionals to learn from LGBT+ disabled people themselves, and thus, this project includes community members with disabilities as co-researchers. With momentum growing in support of disability rights and sexual autonomy, it is extremely important to make sure that the needs of those who are most marginalized (i.e., LGBT+ disabled people) are considered so that the health and wellbeing of everyone might benefit."

Yet now, HIV researchers have turned toward big data, which necessitates a renegotiation of the role of citizen science. For research collaborations, big data science brings two important shifts: data are typically not collected for research purposes; and opportunity for collaboration comes after data collection. Big data science truncates the citizen scientists' ability to shape the conceptualization of data collection including who gets asked, what they get asked, and how. With participating in the conceptualization of data collection removed from their toolkit, what is the potential of citizen science to improve the ethics and veracity of big data HIV research? My current project entails a critical ethnographic examination of one of the first ever HIV citizen science big data research collaborations; it brings together people living with HIV (citizen scientists), big data scientists, social scientists, and clinicians to conduct administrative health data research. Our citizen scientists, who are older adults living with HIV with extensive experience in HIV citizen science, are interested in the recurrence of cardiovascular events among people living with HIV (PLWH) in BC. Using a strength-based approach, we hypothesize that PLWH are better connected to care than people who are not living with HIV in BC and therefore PLWH who have a cardiovascular event have greater survival rates. Our project is in the process of exploring whether this is indeed the case, which will significantly contribute to research on aging with HIV. As research continues to demonstrate the increased risk that people aging with HIV have for developing cardiovascular events, the risk for recurrent cardiovascular events has not been critically explored."

Conditions that would facilitate new epidemics include sub-optimal vaccine coverage, loss of immunity, and changes in sexual networks. Wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) could be used to detect mpox and track outbreaks but has not been validated yet. Other potential surveillance strategies should consider the overlap between mpox and other sexually transmitted infections. For instance, 3 out of 5 people diagnosed with mpox in Canada had a recent history of sexually transmitted infections. Our project aims to inform national decision-making by answering three questions:

1.If new cases emerge, how will we know if there is about to be another large outbreak versus one that is self-contained? 
2.What would it take to stop a new outbreak in its tracks, given the current coverage of vaccinations and infection-derived immunity? 
3.Which surveillance strategies need to be put in place to detect new cases early and efficiently? 

To fill these knowledge gaps, our interdisciplinary team of trainees, epidemiologists, modelers, clinicians, engineers, microbiologists, health economists, public health professionals, and community-based researchers will help our country prepare for and respond to future infectious threats."

These STIs are on the rise in Canada, and disproportionately affect gay,  bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM). Testing is key, but many cases do not present with symptoms, and access to and uptake of testing remains a barrier for many people. Across the world, and in Canada, there are plans to roll-out ""digital"" testing. Digital testing means people do not have to go to a healthcare provider first to get an STI test - they can order the test online, then go to a laboratory to get the test done, and get their results securely online and receive antibiotics if their test comes back positive. In Canada, the first program for digital STI testing started in BC in 2014. The program is called GetCheckedOnline (GCO) and has been shown to change how, when and how often its clients test. What impact has digital testing had on epidemics of syphilis and gonorrhoea in these past 10 years? We set out to answer this question by pulling together all the testing data in BC, survey data among GBM, and building a mathematical model to simulate out the complex sexual network among GBM and variability in testing patterns across individuals. In doing so, we will be able to tell decision-makers who are looking to expand GCO in BC, and to decision-makers across other regions who are looking to implement or expand their digital STI testing programs, how well GCO worked, how it worked, and for whom it worked. That way, we can also provide information on what gaps might still exist, as regions plan their next steps in the public health and clinical response to syphilis and gonorrhoea epidemics in Canada."
Promoting Healthy Drinking Habits in Children: Results of the Healthy Kids Community Challenge,"['Irwin, Bridget R']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,383183,"Background
Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption is a key risk factor for childhood obesity, contributing a substantial proportion of daily calorie intake. As such, there is a growing movement among healthcare practitioners and policymakers to replace SSBs in children's diets with water. 

Objectives
The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Ontario government's Healthy Kids Community Challenge 'Water Does Wonders' interventions in London, Ontario on improving children's drinking habits.

Methods:
Grade 4-8 children at 16 elementary schools across London were enrolled in the study. Five schools received a water bottle filling station (n=434); five schools received a water bottle filling station and a nutrition education intervention (n=339); and six schools received a water bottle filling station and a water education intervention (n=176). Daily self-reported water and SSB consumption was compared across the intervention groups before and after the interventions occurred. 

Results: 
Preliminary analyses suggest an increase in daily water consumption across all groups from pre- to post-intervention, with the greatest difference observed in children receiving both a water bottle filling station and a nutrition education intervention. A slight increase in SSB consumption was also observed across all intervention groups.

Conclusions:
The results demonstrate that school-based environmental and education interventions may be effective at increasing children's water consumption. The observed increase in SSB consumption from pre- to post-intervention, however, suggests that consuming more water does not displace SSBs in children's diets. This study enhances our understanding of the role of environmental and education interventions in improving children's health behaviours. It will inform the development of future school-based water and SSB interventions."

Through their established governance structure, the First Nations Health Authority (FNHA) has been mandated to facilitate high-quality data collection, analysis, and reporting for, by, and with First Nations in British Columbia (BC). Past engagements with First Nations offered context on how health information can be effectively governed, managed, and utilized by transforming existing and inherited health systems. First Nations' communities and organizations clearly expressed the need to have timely access to data to be able to make informed decisions regarding health and wellness. Current public health emergencies have enhanced the urgency to create technical changes that can accommodate the volume of data access work required to support community based responses. To align with traditional principles of knowledge sharing, qualitative data collection methods with an appreciative stance allow space that is grounded in community stories. Subsequent to an overview of work done to date, all regions will: a) confirm whether the findings from previous engagements are still relevant; b) discuss technical components required to operationalize data access requests; and c) discuss mechanisms that will uphold the voice of BC First Nations. The data will inform current systems through a data management policy, regional report cards to measure the health status of First Nations within BC regions, an online platform for access requests, and a toolkit for communities and researchers to ensure wise practices that indicate Ownership, Control, Access, and Possession (OCAP®) of First Nations data. As a result, the FNHA will have feedback to develop systems for data usage that are in alignment with the direction of First Nations in BC."

Predictors of online STIs/HIV intervention diffusion patterns across subgroups of young people in British Columbia.,"['Islam, Md Nazrul']",['N/A'],"['Hiv/Aids', 'Intervention Study', 'Sexually Transmitted Infections']",150000.0,299144,"Reported increase in the rates of three Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs), Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, and Syphilis, over the last 15 years poses an increasingly alarming public health concern in Canada. Public health experts suggest that sexually active youth engage in STI testing. However, STI testing itself is highly stigmatized, and young people's participation in traditional STI testing remains a daunting challenge for public health practitioners. Due to its good uptake, Internet-based STI services have received significant attention by the healthcare systems researchers as a potentially viable alternative to promote STI testing among youth at risk of STIs, though it is a recent addition in Canadian context. Most previous online STI testing initiatives have focused mainly on Chlamydia; HIV testing has been incorporated lately in few occasions. Recently, the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) launched a model of internet-based STI/HIV testing (known as GetChecked) that is integrated with the existing clinic-based services and would provide online access to HIV testing along with conventional testing options for Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, and Syphilis. My research will examine the socio-cultural factors, including the complex interactions among them, that affect the diffusion and uptake of GetChecked across different socio-demographic sub-populations of young people in British Columbia.

All youth clients of GetChecked will be invited via a web-based prompt to participate in a brief client survey at the completion of their first use of GetChecked. Clients consenting to participate will be asked to complete a client survey (administered online using FluidSurveys) at baseline and 3 months post-first use of GetChecked.

The results of my dissertation will help highlight through a predictive model strategies for promoting optimum uptake/diffusion of the intervention across various socio-cultural subgroups of young people in BC to reduce the disease burden of STIs/HIV."

The virtual setting of this project will allow us to reach billions of individuals worldwide."
Asthma medication use during pregnancy: Does timing of asthma diagnosis matter?,"['Issa, Simone']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,411502,"Asthma is the most frequent chronic disease that can complicate pregnancy, with a prevalence of approximately 13% worldwide. The use of asthma medications during pregnancy is recommended by international guidelines to achieve disease control. Women newly diagnosed with asthma prior to pregnancy might be able to incorporate medication use into their routine and persist after becoming pregnant. Women newly diagnosed with asthma during pregnancy may be less likely to use asthma medications due to fear of adverse effects or may be prescribed sub-optimal treatments due to physicians' fear of starting a new therapy during pregnancy. To date, no studies have evaluated the association between the timing of 'new-onset' asthma and asthma medication use during pregnancy. To address this knowledge gap, my study aimed to assess whether asthma medication use during pregnancy differs in women newly diagnosed with asthma during pregnancy compared to women newly diagnosed with asthma prior to pregnancy. We analyzed a large sample of pregnant women aged 15 to 45 years with new-onset asthma at any point in time 2 years prior to pregnancy or in the first 19 weeks of pregnancy. Asthma medication use during pregnancy was defined as filling at least 1 prescription starting 20 weeks of pregnancy (Cohort entry) until delivery considering the last filled prescription during 3 months prior to cohort entry. Newly diagnosed asthma during pregnancy is associated with more use of asthma medications compared to newly diagnosed asthma prior to pregnancy. Asthma diagnosed during pregnancy might be of a different phenotype and more likely to be severe in nature requiring more use of asthma medications. Women with asthma diagnosed prior to pregnancy might step-down in therapy during pregnancy once asthma control is sustained. This study can be used as an impetus for the development of an educational intervention to screen for asthma and initiate the appropriate therapy to reduce perinatal outcomes."
HIV-serodiscordant relationship quality in Canada,"['Iveniuk, James D']",['N/A'],"['Couples', 'Gender', 'Hiv', 'Power', 'Relationship Satisfaction', 'Social Capital']",90000.0,338893,"Many individuals with HIV are living longer, happier lives, and finding long-term romantic partners. However, it is unclear how HIV affects the functioning and dynamics of these relationships. This project proposes to undertake an in-depth examination of couples where only one partner has HIV, using national survey data, to build new theory about how health impacts three different dimensions of relationship quality: satisfaction, equality in power, and positive social relationships built through one's partner. Each of these dimensions of quality has considerable impact on well-being and overall quality of life and are therefore crucial topics for investigation. This project will help scholars and service prodivders understand how our health affects relationships, by affecting a person's own outcomes, and the outcomes of their partner. Furthermore, it will be directly linked to an extensive knowledge translation project, which will create actionable lessons from empirically-tested social theory. Drawing upon the considerable resources of the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health, my work will therefore positively impact the relationships of couples living with HIV."
The social-structural production of drug use-related health risk among street-involved non-injection illicit drug users,"['Ivsins, Andrew']",['N/A'],"['Non-Injection Drug Use', 'Qualitative Research Methods', 'Quantitative Research Methods', 'Social Determinants Of Health', 'Substance Use', 'Vulnerable/Marginalized Populations']",70000.0,257460,"Numerous studies have identified injection drug use as a risk factor for the transmission of blood-borne viruses such as HIV and hepatitis C (HCV). Recently, however, research has shown that street-involved non-injection drug users also have high prevalence rates of HIV and HCV infection. Non-injection drug use (particularly crack smoking) appears to be a risk factor for blood-borne virus infection, suggesting a direct association between non-injection drug use and HIV and HCV. Despite this, research on, and public health interventions aimed at, non-injection drug use are lacking. This study will examine social and structural factors that influence and shape the drug use and related health risk behaviours of non-injection drug users. 
This will be a mixed methods study, using quantitative and in-depth qualitative interviews to collect data from three types of street-involved drug users: 1) those who have never injected, 2) those who formerly injected but no longer do so, 3) those who use drugs by both injection and non-injection methods. Comparison of these 3 forms of drug use will allow for a better understanding of factors and behaviours specifically associated with non-injection drug use. 
This research has direct and important implications for both public health and health policy. By better understanding how social and structural factors shape the drug use and subsequent health of non-injection drug users, this research will help guide the development of targeted prevention and treatment interventions for non-injection drug users. Further, this research will crucially draw attention to the health inequalities faced by the most vulnerable and marginalized people in our society. The proposed research will also provide evidenced-based input for a public health approach to substance use and addiction."

Despite this knowledge about adults, little is known about suicidality (thoughts of taking one's life, creating a plan, attempts) among youth with ASD (15-30 years) as youth are significantly underrepresented in research. With little research that has examined suicidality in youth with ASD, it is unknown how they perceive, understand and experience suicidality. Furthermore, little is known about the factors that contribute to, and or protect youth with ASD from suicidality, and potential similarities/differences among young men and women. This limited knowledge is an urgent concern as it is unknown how to support suicidal youth with ASD, provide adequate health care, or best ways to prevent suicide in this population. Given these gaps in knowledge, the study aims to: 

1)Explore the perspectives, perceptions and experiences of suicidality among youth with ASD. 
2)Understand the factors that contribute to or protect youth from suicidality. 
3)Work with youth with ASD, families, and stakeholders to share knowledge, and work to inform policy and practice. 

This research will generate new knowledge to inform how suicidality is identified, examine how suicidality may be similar or different among young men and women with ASD, uncover the individual/social factors which influence suicidality, and illuminate the factors that may protect youth with ASD from suicidality. The research will contribute new knowledge to inform opportunities for prevention, intervention, and ways to promote mental health against the risk of suicide in youth with ASD. Study findings have the potential to uncover barriers to mental health care, and inform health policy to develop best practices aimed at supporting the mental health needs of youth with ASD."

Does the timing of maturation influence adult bone strength?,"['Jackowski, Stefan A']",['N/A'],"['Adulthood', 'Bone Geometry', 'Bone Mass', 'Bone Strength', 'Dxa', 'Growth And Development', 'Maturation', 'Osteoporosis', 'Pqct']",105000.0,184762,"Osteoporosis is characterized as a disease of aging, yet its onset may have pediatric roots. The adolescent growth period is believed to be a critical period essential for optimizing bone development. The role of maturation on bone mass and geometry on achieving peak bone strength is controversial. An early onset of puberty may expose males and females to estrogen earlier, providing bones with a greater sensitivity to mechanical loading. This enhanced sensitivity can increase bone strength and serve a protective function for bone development. However, the time prior to puberty is associated with a heightened responsiveness to osteogenic stimulation. The question is does the duration of osteogenic stimulation prior to the onset of maturation override the effects of the hormonal influx during puberty. Therefore, the purpose of this proposed study is to examine the long term relationship between the onset of maturation and adult bone strength. Using individuals from the Pediatric Bone Mineral Accrual Study and the Saskatchewan Growth and Development Study, male and female participants will be classified by maturational category, separating participants into early, average and late maturers. Bone strength indices (bone mass and bone geometry) will assessed during adolescence and in adulthood. Hierarchical multilevel models will be constructed to isolate the independent effects of growth, sex and maturation on bone mass and bone geometry. It is hypothesized that the indices of bone strength will be significantly different between maturational groups with late maturers having significantly greater measures of bone mass and geometry than early maturers during adolescence and in adulthood. Since osteoporosis is believed to have pediatric origins, it is important to identify the long term relationship between bone strength and maturation to develop effective intervention strategies accordingly."

Recognizing the steadily growing and evolving biomedical knowledge of HIV, the Resonance Project has the objectives to critically examine:
- if/how gay men are taking up biomedical knowledge of HIV
- if/how biomedical knowledge of HIV has resonance for their everyday lives 
- the discourses men use to make sense of risk, and inform their sexual decision-making and practices, and
- the roles and responsibilities of institutions and service providers in shaping these discourses.  

The research questions are:
1. In what ways do gay and bisexual men living in Canada - individually and as communities - make sense of, incorporate into their understanding, and modify their behaviours based on, biomedical knowledge of HIV?
2. How are community-based organizations and service providers succeeding and struggling in integrating new biomedical knowledge of HIV within their existing (and evolving) social, structural and behavioural prevention efforts?  
3. What key elements - main messages, precautions and caveats - must be incorporated into communication about biomedical knowledge of HIV to be sensitive to the lived realities of gay and bisexual men and their communities? 

This research project will be conducted through 5 phases, moving through an iterative process from understanding to knowledge translation and exchange.

The outcomes of this research project will help HIV prevention stakeholders to identify how they should be integrating recent and emerging biomedical knowledge of HIV into current prevention programs and policies in Canada in ways that are best supported by, and supportive of, people at risk of HIV."
Moving the needle on needle debris: Planning a city-wide intervention to reduce publicly discarded drug paraphernalia,"['Jackson, Jennifer']","['Ens-Giesbrecht, Twyla A', 'Ginn, Carla S']","['Addiction', 'Community Engagement', 'Drug Use', 'Harm Reduction Services', 'Healthy Cities', 'Intersectoral Collaboration', 'Needle Debris']",18311.0,480857,"The consequences of addiction are a pressing issue for all Canadian municipalities. A critical public safety issue associated with injection drug use is needle debris, defined as drug paraphernalia, such as needles or pipes, that are disposed of outside of a safe disposal container. For example, needles may be discarded in an alley following public drug use. 

Needle debris is an important consideration for cities because there is potential harm for people who use drugs, other members of the public, and for the environment. Albertans have cited needle debris as a reason why they oppose expanding community-based harm reduction services (1) such as supervised consumption services (also known as safe injection sites). The inability to access to harm reduction services contributes to deaths from drug poisonings, with 20 Canadians dying every day. 

We have done extensive work learning about needle debris in Calgary. We found that the current approach to addressing needle debris in Calgary could be enhanced by directly including people who use drugs in consultation and greater intersectoral collaboration. By bringing together community partners to co-create and plan an intervention to reduce needle debris in Calgary, we hope to decrease resistance to expanded community-based harm reduction services and mitigate risks for people and animals. Part of the requested funding will be used to compensate people with lived and living experience of injection drug use for their expert participation in our intervention co-design and planning processes. 

After completing the planning process, we will seek funding to implement our intervention in Calgary via a future call through the CIHR Healthy Cities program and expand to other cities in future projects. Our overarching goal is to ensure that there is a low risk of harm from needle debris for all community members and the environment and that people who use injection drugs have access to appropriate harm reduction services."

Methadone's effectiveness as a treatment to help stabilize individuals who are opioid-dependent, and to help them improve their health, has been well established. However, for many individuals, staying on methadone for a long enough period of time to obtain the benefits, and to address their varied physical, mental and social needs, can be challenging.  These individuals require a variety of interventions (such as counseling, medical services, housing and vocational services) to assist them in continuing on methadone, and in improving their health so they can live productive lives.  
With over 20,000 individuals on methadone (and estimates of thousands across the country waiting to enter treatment), we cannot afford interventions that are ineffective, or that do not match the particular needs of different groups.  Our research will help in the development of evidence-informed interventions for individuals on methadone by: a) synthesizing the existing body of knowledge about interventions for this population; and, b) providing an explanation as to what types of interventions work best for the different sub-populations on methadone (e.g., women, men, youth, etc.), and under what conditions.  These results will be utilized by program and policy-makers to help facilitate the refinement and/or co-ordination of existing services across the country.

Let by a team of Indigenous community and scholars, the goal of the centre is to use Indigenous knowledge to shape future STBBI research. Drawing community-based research, and Indigenous and decolonizing approaches to doing research, the following objectives are proposed: (1) support STBBI research that uses Indigenous knowledge to reduce STBBIs in Indigenous communities; (2) support communities, investigators, and trainees through mentorship programs, Learning Institutes, writing retreats, and conference participation; and (3) to focus on interventions and the use of knowledge produced in research to inform health policy and programs.

Over five years that the Feast Centre will operate, it is expected: (1) Funding up to (15) research development and pilot projects; (2) Strengthened existing and support the creation of new research partnerships; (3) Attracting, training and mentoring outstanding Indigenous researchers across diverse disciplines, career stages and communities; (4) Sharing research and the new knowledge produced through innovative prevention of STBBIs; and (5) Increasing collaborations across disciplines and regions with national and international Indigenous and allied research partners, community organizations, policy advisory bodies, and Indigenous community stakeholder groups."
Social Impacts of Biomedical HIV Prevention: PrEP Implementation among People who Inject Drugs,"['Jaffe, Kaitlyn']",['N/A'],"['Cross-National Comparison', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Injection Drug Use', 'Medicalization', 'Mixed Methods', 'Patient-Provider Interaction', 'Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis', 'Prep']",150000.0,362803,"In 2016, Health Canada approved the first preventative medication for use among HIV-negative individuals to protect against the transmission of HIV. This drug, called Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (""PrEP""), has the potential to revolutionize the HIV/AIDS epidemic and has gained widespread endorsement around the world. But for social scientists, critical questions remain regarding the social and ethical implications of medicating people who are not sick but are simply ""at risk."" In addition, existing PrEP research and interventions have focused primarily on men who have sex with men and have ignored the needs of other groups with high rates of HIV transmission, particularly people who inject drugs. In my research, I will address these issues by exploring willingness to use PrEP among people who inject drugs, potential barriers and motivators to using PrEP, and how PrEP interventions can be designed ethically and responsibility to meet the specific needs of people who inject drugs. As Canada begins to incorporate PrEP into HIV prevention initiatives, this research will guide healthcare providers and policymakers as they design PrEP interventions for people who inject drugs and other hard-to-reach and marginalized populations. Further, as new medications are prescribed to ""treat"" risk factors, this data provides empirical evidence to theoretical discussions of medicating risk and mere potential for illness."

Evaluating the benefits of PR is challenging for a number of reasons: the research topics, methods, and study designs are heterogeneous; the extent of collaborative involvement may vary over the duration of a project and from one project to the next; and partnership activities may generate a complex array of both short- and long-term outcomes.

Methods: Our review team consisted of a collaboration among researchers and decision makers in public health, research funding, ethics review, and community-engaged scholarship. We identified, selected, and appraised a large-variety sample of primary studies describing PR partnerships, and in each stage, two team members independently reviewed and coded the literature. We used key realist review concepts (middle-range theory, demi-regularity, and context-mechanism-outcome configurations [CMO]) to analyze and synthesize the data, using the PR partnership as the main unit of analysis.

Findings: From 7,167 abstracts and 591 full-text papers, we distilled for synthesis a final sample of twenty-three PR partnerships described in 276 publications. The link between process and outcome in these partnerships was best explained using the middle-range theory of partnership synergy, which demonstrates how PR can (1) ensure culturally and logistically appropriate research, (2) enhance recruitment capacity, (3) generate professional capacity and competence in stakeholder groups, (4) result in productive conflicts followed by useful negotiation, (5) increase the quality of outputs and outcomes over time, (6) increase the sustainability of project goals beyond funded time frames and during gaps in external funding, and (7) create system changes and new unanticipated projects and activities.

While we know that obesity is increasing everywhere, the level of increase is different in different regions.  This regional-level information is particularly important for authorities because they often decide on policies and programmes for relatively small jurisdictions.  However, most studies do not consider region-level differences.  In our study, we used statistical methods to project obesity levels for 16 health regions in Quebec, and analysed the differences between these regions.  We found that by 2023, between 16% and 25% of the Quebec population will be obese.  We also found that regions had highly variable rates of increase in obesity per year from 1987 to 2012.  These different rates of increase explained the different percentage obese in each region in 2023.  This finding is important for public health authorities because it suggests that monitoring the rate of increase may help decision makers more than monitoring the percent of obese residents in each year, as is usually done."

Community based participatory science: the promise of equitable engagement of marginalized populations in innovative health promoting substance use interventions.,"['Jama, Sadia']",['N/A'],"['Community Based Participatory Research', 'Health Inequities', 'Health Interventions', 'Marginalized Populations', 'Substance Use Epidemiology']",135000.0,493085,"Tobacco is the most preventable cause of disease and death in Canada. Although tobacco use has gone down in the general population, significant differences exist between sub-populations in Canada, where for example marginalized populations in Ottawa report a 96% tobacco smoking rate relative to 9-18% in Ottawa's mainstream populations. This stark inequity in tobacco use translates into devastating healthcare outcomes such as a disproportionate amount of cancer, stroke, heart disease and death. To tackle tobacco related health disparities, a novel approach to smoking cessation in vulnerable populations is required. Pragmatic peer-led community-based approaches to treat and manage tobacco dependence can be implemented with great success in marginalized populations. The Healthy People Initiative (HPI), an example of a pragmatic peer-led community-based approach, will be utilized to compare two tobacco dependence management strategies in the homeless (or at-risk for homelessness) substance using populations of two large Canadian cities (Ottawa and Toronto)."
Development and Implementation of a Health Equity Impact Assessment Methodology in the Mongolian Mining Sector,"['Janes, Craig R']","['Davison, Colleen', 'Laing, Lory M', 'Snyder, Jeremy C']","['Health Equity', 'Health Impact Assessment Methods', 'Mining And Health', 'Social Determinants Of Health']",74536.0,191727,"Led by Canadian investors, the Mongolian mining sector is poised for rapid development.  Mining revenues promise to significantly enhance Mongolian GDP, raising the population's expectations for an increased standard of living.  Yet to date there has been relatively little attention given by government to develop methods to insure that the benefits and risks of mining are distributed equitably among the population. Policy-level initiatives to broaden impact assessments are currently under consideration; evidence-based input is urgently needed.  Responding to this need, we propose to engage in a participatory process with the major stakeholders in the Mongolian mining sector to develop and implement a health equity impact assessment methodology.  We expect that this project will have a substantial and positive impact on Mongolian society by insuring that mining development, which is poised to become the main driver of the economy, will be done responsibly, with full attention to minimizing the social and environmental impacts that produce health inequities, and with a goal of maximizing benefits for affected communities."

Management of these synergistic co-epidemics (syndemics), mandates a shift from disease-specific to integrated public health services across these epidemics. Targeting services to individuals within and across these overlapping epidemics at greatest risk of acquisition or transmission of STIBBIs (core groups) would be more efficient. However, evidence in support of integrated approaches is limited and requires complex, real-time linkage of multiple datasets, logistically challenging for most jurisdictions.Study Objective:We aim to further STIBBI prevention by applying concepts of core groups and syndemic theory to unparalleled provincial surveillance, laboratory, and healthcare utilization data linkages and examine whether real-time data linkage to understand core groups could improve integration and delivery of health services across these epidemics.Research Approach:We will use two novel and unique provincial data linkages, developed in partnership between the BC Centre for Disease Control, the BC Public Health Microbiology Reference Laboratory, and the Ministry of Health. Together, these linkages will support analysis at individual and neighbourhood levels for at least the last 20 years. We will use this information to:1.describe the STIBBI syndemic overlap and identify core groups in BC.We will use descriptive and spatial analyses to describe syndemic overlap and identify geographic clusters in time and space to define core groups and core areas.2. use defined syndemics and core groups to improveSTIBBIhealth services and interventions.We will compare health service delivery levels across core and non-core areas, and develop decision algorithms to prioritize interventions for people diagnosed with STI.3. examine the ethical and implementation impact of re-orienting health services to syndemics and core groups.We will apply our results in a case study design to evaluate integrated testing, care and prevention strategies in the Fraser Health Authority in BC. We will assess the impact of our approach qualitatively, by holding stakeholder interviews and a series of regional dialogues, with particular attention to ethical implications of using linked data for STI interventions.Potential Impact:Our project will lead to improvements in STIBBI prevention by providing population level evidence on the applicability of integrated health services and interventions for STIBBI prevention; and by examining the impact of real-time integrated data on optimal deployment of services while considering program and ethical implications.Our project will also further scientific methods by advancing understanding of STIBBI syndemics and extending the concept of core groups from incident bacterial STIs to chronic viral BBIs. This will inform the development and refinement in intervention strategies, and so our findings will be relevant to initiatives in other jurisdictions as well.Study Team:Our team comprises researchers with relevant expertise (including linkage of administrative datasets for HIV and co-infections, spatial and qualitative analytic methods) working with public health and community leaders who are well situated within provincial and national networks to facilitate rapid knowledge translation and application of study findings across Canada."

While STBBIs differ in how (e.g. through sexual contact or used injection equipment) or through which environments (places) they are often passed, they do have overlaps. These overlaps can mean that some populations in some environments can be more affected by STBBIs than others. Understanding these overlaps and differences is critical for improving overall population health, and for reducing STBBIs and their health consequences, especially for populations most affected.

To better understand and take advantage of these overlaps and differences, our team (e.g., people with lived/living experiences (PWLLE), researchers, healthcare providers, community groups) will use a precision health approach. This approach includes analyzing and collecting data from multiple sources to better understand: overlaps; the unique health, social needs, and environments for different populations; how we can use overlaps to better target STBBI care and prevention interventions for different populations (e.g., targeted and unique: culturally sensitive care, community-based/peer-led services, harm reduction, mental health support, and better screening and management of chronic conditions).

We will also identify and evaluate new and impactful interventions designed to address diverse needs of affected populations, and establish an online knowledge hub for project processes, results, and resources for publics.

This work has great potential for: better understanding the connections among social conditions, STBBIs, and other illnesses; producing evidence to improve existing or creating new public health interventions; and to advance precision public health approaches to improve health equity in Canada."
Built environments as a determinant of obesity in young Canadians,"['Janssen, Ian M', 'Pickett, William']","['Freeman, John G']","['Adolescent', 'Built Enviornment', 'Multi-Level Modeling', 'Obesity', 'Physical Activity', 'Population Health']",261707.0,184971,"Childhood obesity is at an epidemic level in Canada.  This is a problem because childhood obesity is a risk factor for heart disease and stroke in later life.  Features of the built environment around children may impact childhood obesity.  The built environment refers to physical features such as the presence and condition of recreation facilities, walking paths, and food retailers.

We will explore whether the built environment contributes to obesity in Canadian children.  We will use data from national surveys of grade 6-10 Canadian youth that we collect every 4 years.  In 2006, we collected data on 9000 children from 188 schools.  In 2009-10 we will survey 90,000 additional children.  It is possible to link these survey data with information that describes built environments in schools and neighbourhoods.  Using these sources we will study how the built environment impacts obesity and its determinants (physical inactivity, poor diet).  We will also study whether social and geographic factors influence the ability of the built environment to impact obesity.  Social factors will include wealth and cohesion within schools and neighbourhoods.  Geographic factors will include the population size and climate of the communities in which youth live.  

Our goal is to better understand how the built environment impacts obesity in youth.  Our findings will help inform health policies and prevention strategies for reducing obesity in this age group."

Among healthy children, approximately one in five kindergartners (20%) lacks the developmental skills to take advantage of school-based education. Among children with identified special health needs at that age, this proportion rises to almost 80%. The study's objective is to estimate prevalence and investigate social determinants of developmental outcomes for children with health disorders at an early age, using the Early Development Instrument (EDI). There is evidence, both from Canada and from other countries, that childhood health disorders are associated with lower socioeconomic status. It is not known whether the size of the SES effect is larger in children with health disorders than in typically developing children. Study objectives will be achieved through three steps. First, using the existing data for 8 provinces and 2 territories collected from 2010-2014, we will investigate differences in the EDI scores among children with identified health disorders (reported on the EDI). Second, the linked databases of EDI with sociodemographic data will be used to explore association between socioeconomic characteristics and rates of specific diagnoses among 5-year-olds. Third, for 3 of these 10 regions, there are additional health and/or education databases available that will be linked at an individual level. These data will be used to establish the differences in the EDI outcomes in relation to the timing of diagnosis, and presence of intervention or treatment. With the help of a long-established team of collaborators from across Canada, this study builds on existing resources and continuing research. The results of analyses of developmental outcomes for those children combined with SES will have implications for both health service delivery and school-based intervention strategies. Results will also contribute to a framework for public policy."
EDI and the Early Years,"['Janus, Magdalena']",['N/A'],"['Developmental Outcomes', 'Early Child Development', 'Population-Level', 'Questionnaire']",3000.0,360995,"A child's early years are incredibly important. What happens during the first five years has lifelong effects. That's because the brain develops rapidly during these years and changes based on a child's experiences.

Sadly, not all children have positive experiences and lack the stimulation, support, and nurturance needed for the brain to develop in the healthiest way possible. That means there are more challenges for these children as they grow.

But if we help children and families early, we can avoid many negative outcomes thanks to the brain's ability to easily change and adapt at this stage.

Our research team created a whiteboard video to promote the idea that making meaningful changes for all children and families starts with understanding how all children are doing. If we don't know how children are doing, we can't identify any problems, we can't effectively help them, and we won't know if things are getting better or worse. The solution is the Early Development Instrument (EDI).

The EDI measures kindergarten children's ability to meet age-appropriate developmental expectations across five general areas: Physical Health and Well-Being, Social Competence, Emotional Maturity, Language and Cognitive Development, and Communication Skills and General Knowledge.

Focusing on strengthening the areas in which children are vulnerable allows schools, communities, and governments to make decisions on how to best support early development and ensure all children have the best start to life possible.

By promoting the EDI in a fun, accessible way, we hope to mobilize communities and engage those who aren't usually involved in promoting the healthy development of young children. By getting a glimpse of the potential of the EDI, people can be inspired to do something to improve the lives of our young children and help shape a better future in their own communities and beyond."

This research will use a Community Based Participatory Research approach that will involve all team members as equal partners in the development, implementation, interpretation and dissemination of this research.  Conceptually it will be based on a Positive Youth Development framework.  The community will be engaged through: (1) consultations and workshops with youth and other community members to further explore Popular Theatre as a suicide prevention intervention and appropriate means for implementation in each community, and (2) active participation of community members and knowledge users in the youth theatre performances.  Youth will participate in multi- week workshops to plan the performance. During the performance, actors and audience members will be encouraged to re-enact scenarios to find solutions.  We will evaluate the strengths and resilience factors that are most enhanced at the individual and community level, and how these translate into action, through questionnaires and discussions with the youth and audiences."
Developing COVID-19 Risk Communication and Community Engagement Readiness Strategy Guidance for Travelers Visiting Friends and Relatives (VFR),"['Jardine, Cynthia', 'Choi, Alexandra', 'Henry, Bonnie J', 'Driedger, S.

People who travel back to their countries of origin to visit friends and relatives (VFR) (including the children of immigrants and international students) are often at a higher risk of getting the disease and then spreading it to others. A better understanding of VFR traveler knowledge, risk perceptions, information needs, barriers to pre-travel care and advice, and access to protective measures will help us better develop strategies to keep travelers healthy. This will prevent the spread of COVID-19 and its potential negative consequences.  Our research will take place in the Fraser Valley and lower mainland of British Columbia as an area with a high number of immigrants. We are seeking information from Chinese and Punjabi VFR travelers, international students at the University of the Fraser Valley, and family physicians.  We will use a combination of focus groups, surveys and interviews to get this information.  The researchers for this study have a lot of experience in working with immigrant populations on infectious diseases to determine their risk communication needs.  This includes research with VFR travelers. The University of the Fraser Valley has partnerships with organizations (such as the Divisions of Family Practice and Community Services) that enable us to easily access research participants.  They will also help us access their large and diverse international student body.  Including researchers from other countries, like Australia and New Zealand, will help us make sure our research and recommendations can be part of a coordinated international response.  Our research also includes senior people in the BC provincial health system to make sure our results can be quickly used in practice."

Mothers in particular are simultaneously managing paid employment, household work, homeschooling and/or childcare. The impact has been particularly severe for South Asian mothers in Canada, who often experienced further stressors such as language barriers, living in multigenerational households, and transnational economic and social responsibilities. South Asian women and their family members are often at higher risk for contracting COVID-19 as they are more likely to work in employment sectors with greater exposure to the virus. They have also been more severely affected by job loss during the pandemic as they are over-represented in hard-hit industries such as food and accommodation services. Finally, South Asian women have faced increased racial prejudice, often being falsely blamed for the pandemic.

To date there is limited knowledge on the health, psychosocial and socio-economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on mothers in Canadian South Asian communities, how these impacts affect their families, and what resources and supports facilitated their ability to cope. Guided by an intersectional feminist framework and using a strength-based approach, we will examine the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19 and levels of moral distress in South Asian mothers. Moral distress is defined as knowing the right action to take, but being constrained from taking it because of barriers beyond the individual's control. We will conduct interviews with 20-30 South Asian mothers with dependent children and interviews with 10 community organizations. This research will be conducted in the Fraser Health Region of BC in collaboration with provincial knowledge users and community organization partners. Knowledge translation will include infographic reports of results, community workshops, sharing of stories of 'surviving and thriving' through a booklet and workshops, and workshops for service providers."
"Improving equity and access to a universal newborn screening tool for hip dysplasia in rural, remote and Indigenous communities","['Jaremko, Jacob L', 'Dulai, Sukhdeep']","['Bailey, Allan L', 'Bevan, Sian', 'Joseph, Reg', 'Oster, Richard T', 'Rakkunedeth Hareendranathan, Abhilash']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Developmental Hip Dysplasia', 'Implementation', 'Indigenous Health', 'Ultrasound', ""Women And Children'S Health""]",248870.0,505355,"Developmental hip dysplasia (DDH) is a condition where the ball-and-socket hip joint has a shallow socket.  It is generally curable by wearing a harness if detected while the patient is a baby, but if missed, leads to multiple surgeries in childhood, early osteoarthritis, a lifetime of pain and hip replacement. 

DDH affects 1.5% of female babies vs. only 0.7% of male babies, and the risk of having DDH is 3.6 times higher for females than males.  Worse, 85% of severe DDH requiring surgery occurs in females. Rates of DDH are also much higher in some Indigenous populations. 

DDH screening by hip ultrasound currently requires scans performed by expert sonographers and interpreted by radiologists, which may require patients to travel to large centers. The universal DDH ultrasound screening performed in parts of Europe is not currently offered in Canada/USA, due to factors such as inconclusive scans requiring costly follow-up. Instead, only babies with risk factors such as having breech presentation or family history are screened. Unfortunately, selective screening has not reduced the rate of late DDH detection, as many infants with DDH lack risk factors and are missed. Our pilot work shows that new technology combining inexpensive portable ultrasound with automated artificial intelligence (AI) image analysis may make DDH screening more practical and reliable. We propose an implementation study to focus on how to most equitably screen babies using this innovation, especially female babies, and those in rural, remote and/or Indigenous communities where health care is hard to access.  We will work closely with patient and community partners, to help us understand the complex interplay between gender, sex, screening, and innovation implementation.  Our goal is to provide evidence and tools to support universal screening of DDH, especially for those at highest risk and who have the most difficulty obtaining healthcare."
Beneficial and harmful effects of early-life environmental exposures on childhood development - a cohort study.,"['Jarvis, Ingrid M']",['N/A'],"['Air Pollution', 'Early Development', 'Environmental Health', 'Green Spaces', 'Noise Pollution', 'Urbanization']",105000.0,406753,"Approximately one in four Canadian children are considered to have deficiencies in early development prior to entering primary education. Vulnerabilities in early development are of great concern, as early childhood development is an important predictor for physical, mental, and social health through the life course. While the impact of socioeconomic status (SES) is well-researched, the potential influence of environmental exposures on children's early development is poorly understood.  
The primary aim of this project is to study the associations between various environmental exposures on children's early development in Metro Vancouver, Canada. The project will focus on environmental exposures during early life - prenatally up to the age of five. The project will specifically investigate the impacts of beneficial (natural environments) and harmful (air pollution and noise) environmental exposures on childhood development, including whether the beneficial effects of natural environments have a moderating effect on harmful exposures. A secondary aim of this project is to evaluate if exposure to natural environments can contribute to mitigating the adverse effects of children living in poor socioeconomic conditions.  
This project is of high significance as it addresses rising Canadian concerns, including children's early development, disparities in public health, and the environmental effects of an urbanizing society. Knowledge from this project may contribute to preventative strategies aimed towards improving health outcomes across the life course."

Furthermore, men in NB have the second highest incidence of cancers in the country (Hayward & Colman, 2003). Many men are estranged from primary care services and take few positive healthy practices to protect and maintain their health (Oliffe et al., 2010). The recent primary care reform offers a window of opportunity to influence change and include men-centered approaches to address relevant health issues with inclusive and integrated approaches to care. Our dynamic and responsive research team fosters collaboration among practice leaders, researchers, and decision makers to develop, implement and evaluate innovative approaches to the delivery of men-centered health care services and interventions. These approaches will be cost-effective and the measurable outcomes will advance the well-being of men living in NB and their families. These approaches will also promote continuous collaboration between men, primary care, and public health to leverage resources and tailor gender sensitive interventions and services."
Innovative Knowledge Translation Methodologies and Interventions to Enhance Youth Mental Health,"['Jenkins, Emily K']",['N/A'],"['Community Health', 'Effectiveness Studies', 'Focus Groups', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Mental Health Promotion', 'Mixed Methods', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Interviews', 'Social Network Analysis', 'Survey Research']",105000.0,257462,"In recent years, the importance of effectively sharing research findings with knowledge users (e.g. practitioners, general public, policy makers), a process termed knowledge translation, has been identified as a priority and viewed as critical to improving health outcomes. However, most of the research in this area has focused on developing strategies to share clinically relevant knowledge, with inadequate attention given to the needs of those seeking to improve population-level health outcomes through work in community settings. This study will address this knowledge gap through the development and assessment of an innovative strategy aimed at sharing research findings to target what the World Health Organization has recently identified as the most significant health problem facing young people today, mental health issues. This study will utilize Dialogue Workshops, an intervention in which youth and adults are brought together in community settings to discuss contemporary health and social issues. In these Dialogue Workshops, research evidence about youths' experiences of emotional distress (e.g., stress, anxiety, depression) will be shared. It is believed that creating a venue for youth and adults to come together to discuss youth's experiences with emotional distress will help to foster connectedness and empathy towards adolescents' experiences; two factors shown to promote mental health outcomes in youth. The effectiveness of this intervention will be assessed using novel research techniques to track the spread of knowledge gained through participation in the Dialogue Workshops within the community. Additionally, factors that foster mental health will be measured. This study will contribute new understandings and guidance for those involved in community-based knowledge translation and will provide evidence for a strategy aimed at promoting the mental health of Canadian youth."

Yet because of methodological problems in the study of relationships we do not yet know whether the strength of this relationship comes from the individuals involved (a trait aspect to behavior, e.g. negativity, that a person carries with them into different relationships), the unique combination of two people in a dyad (a child is easy for one parent but difficult for the other) or the family as a whole (an emotional climate pervades the family). 
This project proposes a follow-up of a birth cohort of children, their older siblings and their parents (501 families enlisted in 2005-2006) who have taken part in four waves of data collection as part of the Kids, Families and Places (KFP) study. The inclusion of up to four children per family, with data from both parents, has allowed us to track the relationship between individual characteristics of family members, relationship dynamics and children's mental health across early life. 
In the present study we propose visiting our families two more times. We use two novel methods to investigate the development of cooperation in family relationships. One method involves every member of the family interacting with every other member and fitting a complex statistical model that allows us to isolate effects of individuals, from effects of dyads, from effects of the whole family. We use data from the first 4 waves to explain variation between individuals (both genetic and early developmental data), dyads (the interaction of the personalities of each member of the dyad) and families (cumulative social disadvantage). In our second study by coding 10 minutes of interaction for each dyad during conflict and cooperation tasks, we examine the moment-to-moment interactional processes that encourage or discourage cooperation and how these interactional patterns predict children's mental health."
"Ethnic disparities in HCV-related extrahepatic manifestations: a population-based study in British Columbia, Canada","['Jeong, Dahn']",['N/A'],"['Chronic Hcv Infection', 'Ethnic Disparities', 'Extrahepatic Manifestations', 'Ics Travel Awards', 'Population-Based Study']",4679.0,495241,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can lead to inflammation in different parts of the body, causing what are known as extrahepatic manifestations (EHMs). These can include heart diseases, diabetes, neurocognitive disorders (NCD), and chronic kidney diseases (CKD). The risk of experiencing these EHMs can vary among people from different ethnicities due to biological factors and socioeconomic disparities. 

In our study, we investigated these varying risks among individuals with chronic HCV, focusing on those of East Asian and South Asian descent in British Columbia. This study drew data from a large population-based data, the BC Hepatitis Testers Cohort, which includes 1.3 million people tested for HCV between 1990 and 2015, linked with various health administrative datasets such as physician visits, hospitalizations and chronic disease registry. We included individuals who were diagnosed with chronic HCV and examined the rate at which these individuals were diagnosed with EHMs. We also assessed the risk of EHMs among various ethnic groups, while considering factors such as whether they received HCV treatment, age and sex, socioeconomic status, and other medical conditions.

We observed that untreated individuals, regardless of their ethnicity, were more likely to develop EHMs, with the exception of type 2 diabetes. Untreated South Asians had the highest rate of EHMs diagnoses, and after accounting for treatment and other factors, we found that they had a higher risk of CKD compared to others, while HCV treatment reduced the EHM risk for all ethnic groups. South Asians also had a higher risk of diabetes compared to other ethnicities, while East Asians had a lower risk of MACE and NCD compared to others.

This study highlighted the differing risks of EHMs among East and South Asians living with chronic HCV. These findings emphasize the importance of tailored interventions to better support individuals of East and South Asian descent who are living with HCV."

Since 2014, the Gardasil® vaccine has been available free of charge to Albertan children through school-based immunization programs, yet uptake remains suboptimal. In addition to challenges associated with overcoming vaccine hesitancy, research has also suggested gaps in knowledge about the health benefits and indications for the vaccine may be contributing to this trend. Decision aids have often proven effective for engaging target groups with unbiased information to support individual-decision making. In 2016, the Alberta Cancer Prevention Legacy Fund launched a version of our online HPV Vaccine Decision Aid Tool to increase immunization rates by supporting Albertans in making informed decisions about immunizing themselves and their children to protect against HPV infection.

Between February 2017 and June 2019, we gathered data from visits to the tool by over 3000 unique individuals. Almost 70% of users of the HPV vaccine decision aid tool were individuals seeking the HPV vaccine for themselves, approximately 48% of whom were female. The most common concern selected by users of the tool was related to the cost of the HPV vaccine (50.5%). Once the sample was split into individuals and parents, it became clear that these two groups had very different concerns regarding the HPV vaccine. Parents were more concerned about risk-based concerns such as safety (61.5%), ingredients (45.7%) and side effects (57.7%). In contrast, individuals were more concerned about logistical issues such as the cost of the vaccine (62.0%), the number of injections (39.1%), and when they should receive the vaccine (47.6%).

This information could be used to deliver targeted health marketing campaigns that address the leading concerns of different groups of Albertans considering obtaining the HPV vaccine who have not yet made a decision on whether to immunize but are actively seeking information."

OBJECTIVES:
#1 Enable rapid collection of high-quality COD information to influence disease control priorities in 5 LMICs/1.5 billion people. This grant will deepen our prior study in India to investigate unexpected disease patterns documented in 2001-13, enable similar studies in Ethiopia, Bangladesh, Mozambique and Sierra Leone, support innovations, train researchers, and link statistics to health policy and control programs.

#2 Investigate changing mortality from smoking and other risk factors to influence control programs and individual understanding of risk in 10 countries/2.3 billion people. We will conduct retrospective and prospective studies on ~120 million living/dead persons. We document changing tobacco hazards, especially in LMICs. We also investigate changing hazards from smoking and the age, sex and SES-specific benefits of tobacco cessation in clinically relevant subgroups (e.g. diabetic or hypertensive). Later, we investigate other classic and emerging risk factors.

Our request is consistent with CIHR's Research Roadmap, the principles of CIHR Governing Council and Government of Canada plans to expand its global health footprint.

Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC): A National Profile of Dietary and Lifestyle Factors on Environmental Contaminants Exposure in Maternal Blood and Urine,"['Jiang, Yue']",['N/A'],"['Biostatistics', 'Environmental Epidemiology', 'Reproductive Health', 'Toxiciology']",17500.0,201197,"Background: MIREC is a national cohort study conducted on a Canadian population. It employs biomonitoring - the measurement of environmental chemicals or their metabolites in blood, urine, and human milk. Currently, Statistics Canada in partnership with Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada is conducting a national population-based Canadian Health Measures Survey, which will provide baseline data on exposure to environmental chemicals in the general Canadian population, but not in the maternal and newborn population. Specifically, there is no national information on the correlation between lifestyle and environmental chemical exposure in pregnancy. Rationale: MIREC can lead to better understanding of the path of exposure. It would aid in improving health risk assessment and prevention in pregnant women. Past studies had indicated correlations between exposure routes and levels of environmental chemicals in the body of pregnant women. With a large-scale national-wide study (MIREC), these correlations can be studied further. Hypothesis: There is a correlation between environmental chemicals present in maternal blood/urine and maternal dietary/lifestyle factors. Objective: To investigate maternal dietary and lifestyle factors which correlate with certain environmental chemicals in maternal blood and urine. The following correlations will be investigated: smoking habits versus cotinine (metabolite of nicotine) in blood; fish consumption versus mercury (heavy metal) in blood; and cosmetic products use versus phthalates (plasticizer) in urine. Methods: 2000 women will be recruited for the MIREC study. Spot blood and urine samples will be collected for every trimester of pregnancy and delivery. Specified environmental chemicals will be measured and recorded. Questionnaires information will be collected from the participants. In addition, biostatistics will be used to analyze data."
Fostering emotional resilience among youth: Using youth narratives to promote understanding and connectedness between youth and adults,"['Johnson, Joy L']","['Bottorff, Joan L', 'Haines-Saah, Rebecca J', 'Oliffe, John L', 'Schonert-Reichl, Kimberly A', 'Shoveller, Jeannie A']","['Emotional Distress', 'Gender', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Narrative Analysis', 'Qualitative Interviews', 'Resilience', 'Rural Health', 'Youth Health']",100000.0,258197,"Emotional resilience refers to a person's capacity to develop positively despite adversity and can be understood as a process that develops over time and in specific personal and environmental contexts. Without a capacity for resilience, emotional distress including anxiety and stress can accrue, leading to increased vulnerability to mental illness. As 1.2 million Canadian children and youth suffer from mental illness, fostering resilience in Canadian youth in timely and necessary. Research shows that connectedness, or meaningful connection, between youth and adults can enhance emotional resilience among youth. Our community-based study will take place in three locations in British Columbia (Fort St. James, Kelowna, and Vancouver) and will first explore youth's experiences of emotional distress in order to account for their lived experiences. Next, we will share our findings from the youth interviews in workshop settings with adults as a means of fostering connection between youth and adults. We will then conduct follow-up interviews with our workshop participants to assess the impact of this approach in promoting youth and adult connectedness. Ultimately, this study will increase our understanding of youth's experiences of emotional distress and of ways to promote connectedness between youth and adults to foster emotional resilience in youth."
Air pollution and Asthma in Canada: Projections of burden and the value of climate adaptation strategies,"['Johnson, Kate M']","['Adibi, Amin', 'Brauer, Michael', 'Brigham, Emily P', 'Carlsten, Christopher', 'Giang, Amanda', 'Harvard, Stephanie']","['Air Pollution', 'Asthma', 'Health Economics']",124796.0,485322,"Air pollution is a daily threat to the health of Canadians and remains persistently high due to climate change and inadequate emissions control regulations. Currently, one third of Canadians live in areas where they are regularly exposed to harmful levels of air pollution (as defined by Health Canada). The 3.8 million Canadians with asthma are particularly susceptible to the negative health impacts of air pollution, as several types of pollutants, including fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and gaseous pollutants (O3, NO2, and SO2), can cause asthma to develop, worsen asthma symptoms, and lead to asthma 'attacks.' Projections of the future burden of air pollution on Canadians with asthma and strategies to reduce this impact are currently unknown. Our project will meet this need through two objectives. In Objective 1, we will combine state-of-the-art air quality projections (2020-2036) with an existing simulation model that tracks the development of asthma in the entire Canadian population and its progression over a person's lifetime. We will project the number of people with asthma, days with asthma symptoms, asthma exacerbations and healthcare costs caused by changes to air quality over the next 16-years. In Objective 2, we will use this model to assess the value-for-money of a government distribution program of at-home portable air cleaners (which reduce exposure to PM2.5) in terms of its impact on overall costs, life expectancy, and quality of life. We will evaluate differences in health impacts and the value of air cleaners based on a person's age, sex, whether they have existing asthma, and the socio-economic characteristics of communities where the program could be implemented. To ensure our work is responsive to the needs of those most impacted by air pollution, our team is comprised of researchers, patients with asthma, and policy makers in government. Our research can ultimately help ensure we meet the urgent need to adapt to climate change in Canada."
"A pilot study of the association between nutrition, balance and falls.","['Johnson, Shanthi']","['Barden, John M']","['Elderly', 'Falls', 'Function', 'Nutrition', 'Physical Balance']",42076.0,202703,"The importance of balance can be seen in every aspect of daily living: walking up the stairs, bending over to tie shoelaces, or standing still. The loss or impairment of balance can influence one's quality of life, decrease functional performance and lead to fall-related injuries, which are the leading causes of mortality and morbidity among older adults with considerable physical, psychological, and economic costs. In both young and old, age-related physiological changes, the presence of injury, disease, and medication can create disturbances in the ability to maintain balance. The effects of dietary fasting, which is characterized by an absence of caloric intake, on balance have not been well examined, although it is common for individuals to practice partial fasting (e.g., as part of a weight loss strategy, an inability to prepare/consume food on one's own due to frailty, or as a consequence of religious practices). A limited number
of studies show that fasting contributes to decreased endurance capacity and balance as well as to increased heart rate and blood lactate levels during exercise, all of which are detrimental to physical performance. These studies, however, have involved only functionally elite men such as athletes or soldiers. No studies to date have been examined on the physical effects of fasting as they apply to the general population. This catalyst grant will first examine the effects of short-term interruption of caloric intake on balance in healthy elderly persons living in the community to understand the mechanism of the relationship and assess the feasibility/validity of field-based balance measures. The larger project that the catalyst grant (pilot projects in aging) will spur will examine the impact of nutrition intervention on balance and falls among frail older adults."

There are new opportunities to use increasing amounts of data from primary care to identify and reduce health inequalities among Canadians.   Most people in Canada have a regular place where they receive primary care over their life span, usually based in their community.  Artificial intelligence applied to primary care data, especially patient reported information, may offer greater understanding of health and how it evolves differently across  subpopulations.  
Guided by the Strategy for Patient Oriented Research (SPOR) patient engagement framework, we will bring together public health and primary care leaders, clinicians and patients,  information technology and artificial intelligence leaders with researchers to identify the most important research questions to answer with the application of artificial intelligence to the Canadian Practice Information Network (CPIN) to promote health equity across Canadian communities.  CPIN is developing an automated physician-deployed patient engagement platform for primary care practices to efficiently communicate with their patient populations and collect data on patient experiences. Through a consensus building approach we will draw on the diverse individual expertise, lived experiences, and perspectives of participants to identify priority research opportunities arising from advancing AI capabilities and this primary care practice-based patient engagement platform.  We are bringing together a team with research expertise and broad perspectives and expertise to advance 1-2 ideas as research proposals and develop the collaboration necessary to carry these forward successfully."

Work Stress and Alcohol Dependence in a Canadian Working Population,"['Jones, Arden']",['N/A'],"['Alcohol Dependence', 'Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health & Well Being', 'Depression', 'Longitudinal Data', 'National Population Health Survey', 'Occupational Health', 'Work Stress']",17500.0,254062,"Alcohol dependence imposes a substantial burden on society and has been identified as an important risk factor for disease such as neuropsychiatric disorders and cardiovascular disease, as well as a risk factor injury. The effect of problem drinking on health is detrimental; in 2004 an estimated 4% of all global deaths and 4-5% of global disability-adjusted life years were attributable to alcohol, making problematic alcohol consumption among the largest avoidable risk factors for burden of disease. Studies have found that workplace factors are associated with an increased risk of depression, which is often comorbid with problem drinking. The relationship between problem drinking and depression may be bi-directional; as such, it is possible that work stress is a risk factor for problem drinking and alcohol dependence. In view of the fact that the majority of adults spend a large portion of their time in formal employment, developing a thorough understanding of how the workplace influences alcohol dependence is vital. The objectives of proposed project are to examine: (1) the epidemiology of problem drinking and alcohol dependence; (2) the relationship between work stress and alcohol dependence and problem drinking in the Canadian working population; and (3) the role of major depression in this relationship. It is hypothesized that employees reporting high levels of work stress will have increased levels of problem drinking and increased risk of alcohol dependence. Data from the longitudinal cohort of Canadian National Population Health Survey (NPHS) will be used for analysis. The NPHS follows a representative cohort  of Canadians every two years since 1994. This study will analyze data from the same individuals at every cycle to understand how changes in workplace stress affect the occurrence of alcohol use and depression. Such knowledge will identify work conditions amenable to intervention in an effort to reduce workplace stress and employee alcohol use."
Exploring the process of policy formulation and analysing implications for health promotion: the case of national policy on global health,"['Jones, Catherine M']",['N/A'],"['Global Health', 'Health In All Policies', 'Health Promotion', 'Key Informant Interviews', 'Multiple Case Study', 'Public Policy', 'Qualitative Research']",150000.0,273536,"Today, health concerns occupy a prominent place in the realm of global issues and priorities.  Health on a global scale has surpassed the domain of international organisations such as WHO, and penetrated the interests of national policy makers outside the formal health sector. This is demonstrated by recent discussions in the UN General Assembly on the prevention of non-communicable diseases. The effects of globalization have increased the interdependence of countries, therefore adding a global dimension to national policy on health.  Public policies are recognised as instruments with potential to improve population health. The field of health promotion is particularly interested in how equity and a positive concept of health can support the development of national policy on global health.  This research will aim to better understand what role ideas about the promotion of health have in this newly emerging type of policy.  By exploring cases from the United Kingdom and Switzerland, the first two countries to adopt such a policy, the research will examine these policies in terms of their objectives, their resources, the actors involved, and their actions.  It will examine what opportunities exist for the values of health promotion, such as equity, to influence these policies.  To examine this, I will analyse publically available documents and conduct interviews with key actors. This research will contribute to a better understanding of what ideas and values are considered in the face of the challenge to make global health a concern for national public action.  The relevance of this research will be its contribution to reflecting on how national public policy can contribute to global health equity."

However, Aboriginal people with HIV - who make up a disproportionate number of Canadians living with the disease - are more likely to die from HIV-related causes and die without receiving treatment compared to other Canadians living with HIV. This study will test a new approach to helping young Aboriginal people living with HIV who use drugs overcome the barriers to getting and staying on HIV treatment, based on successful trials of a similar approach in Kenya. Researchers in Kenya showed that introducing mobile phone technology into HIV care helped participants overcome issues of poverty, rural living, transience, and stigma to improve HIV treatment adherence and health outcomes. 

I will test the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of using mobile technology to improve uptake and adherence to HIV treatment among young Aboriginal people living with or at high risk of HIV in British Columbia. This study will take place within the Cedar Project, an on-going prospective cohort that monitors HIV and HCV infection among 600 Aboriginal people aged 14-30 who use illicit drugs in Vancouver, Prince George and Chase, BC. A pre-post test design using mixed-methods will evaluate use of mobile phone technology to improve access to HIV treatment among participants by measuring self-reported adherence, CD4 and viral load every six months. Interviews and focus groups will determine the acceptability and cultural safety of the program. 

Considering its demonstrated effectiveness, it is critical to determine if mobile technology can foster resiliency, access to treatment, and adherence in a culturally safe setting for young Aboriginal people living with or at risk of HIV. The implications of this research have great significance for developing interventions to improve HIV treatment not only among Aboriginal young people but also among other vulnerable groups in Canada."

In addition to negatively affecting these individual-level trajectories, mental health problems may disrupt young peoples' sense of being full citizens in their communities. Studies have shown that supporting people's capacities to live as full citizens can help people recovery from their mental health problems. However, all of this research has examined citizenship among adults with mental health problems. It is unclear if and how young people with mental health problems may suffer a lack of citizenship; what citizenship means for young people; nor is it clear what factors predict citizenship and if citizenship is related to recovery. Addressing these knowledge gaps may prevent or limit potential losses to young people's sense of citizenship; and may help young people remain or become more engaged in their communities. To address these knowledge gaps, I have worked with youth with mental health problems to identify three objectives to be evaluated through the use of participatory, mixed research methods. We will conduct interviews to discover the meaning of, and perceived facilitators and barriers to citizenship among youth with mental health problems, as well as the role citizenship plays in participants' recovery. Based on the qualitative findings, we will use questionnaires to examine rates and predictors of citizenship among a larger sample of youth with mental health problems, and the degree to which citizenship predicts recovery. We will then use qualitative methods to evaluate a pre-existing citizenship-based intervention. Results will be shared with youth, clinicians and policy makers throughout the world, and will help improve youth mental health services in Canada."

While the findings have been diffused and shared with the media, academics, professionals in the autism community and some policy makers, through varied knowledge transfer tools and strategies, there are still misconceptions from the general public, and misrepresentations of autism in the media, which are the main causes of exclusion and marginalization of autistic adults, impacting their quality of life and their mental health.
The CONNECT team wants to explore the potential of gamification, and more specifically, of serious games, at improving the public's understanding and knowledge about autism in adulthood and at reducing the stigma around autism. The data serving as evidence for the game development will be drawn from the CONNECT's findings and from the lived experiences of autistic adults and their caregivers. 
Several challenges limit the ability of the actual core team to take on such multidisciplinary and multisectoral research project now (ie, lack of expertise in game design, in theories of learning or in ethics in visual arts and communication). The goal of this grant proposal is to support the planning phase of the game's development and effectiveness assessment, through 3 main objectives: 
1) complement the team's expertise with experts in Ethics of representation, game production, and education, 2) develop an inclusive outreach and engagement strategy to diverse knowledge-users for the development of the larger research project,  and 3) co-develop a funding proposal framework to be adapted to several upcoming funding opportunities.
By increasing the expertise and readiness of the team, this project will strengthen subsequent grant applications for the assessment of a serious game depicting the varied life challenges and opportunities of autistic as an effective knowledge dissemination strategy."

However, our studies show that this standard yields unexpected results and is very different from the reference currently used in Canada. We propose to adapt the INTERGROWTH standard for Canada by identifying the birth weight-for-gestational age centiles of this standard that distinguish babies at low vs high risk for illness and death. We will also evaluate how well these birth weight cut-offs perform in practice. Information on all singleton live births in Canada and the United States will be included in the study with information obtained from large perinatal databases. We will use an outcome-based methodology, which we have previously developed, to identify the birth weight at each gestational age at which rates of newborn illness and death are higher than normal. The performance of these cut-offs for identifying high risk babies will be evaluated to ensure that they function optimally in clinical practice in the multi-ethnic Canadian population."
Towards Cultural Safety in Contracting in Mental Health & Addictions Care,"['Josewski, Viviane']",['N/A'],"['Critical Theory', 'Ethics/Cultural Safety', 'Funding Modalities/Contracting', 'Health Equity', 'Health Policy & Services', 'Ics Travel Awards', 'Indigenous Ngo Sector', 'Mental Health And Addictions Care', 'Qualitative Research', 'Reconciliation']",960.0,346459,"Although 'contracting' with Indigenous NGOs is generally accepted as an effective method to fund health care that is culturally appropriate and responsive to urban Indigenous populations, little is known about how this fits with the experiences of Indigenous providers. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop a better understanding of how contracting shapes the provision of mental health and addictions care from the perspective of Indigenous providers. To this end, this study used a partnership-based approach, and collected interview data from mental health and addictions service providers, administrative leaders and decision-makers from both funding and Indigenous provider organizations within the off-reserve context of British Columbia. This data was analyzed in relation to a document review using thematic interpretation and critical theory. Findings support that 'contracting' is important to the provision of mental health and addictions programs that Indigenous peoples deem to be culturally safe. Yet, contractual arrangements often were experienced as challenging  because of competing interests, and underlying value tensions, which required difficult trade-offs. In some areas, this limited the organization's 'capabilities' for mission-driven, programmatic delivery of mental health and addictions services at the same time as it expanded the options of others. By placing these experiences in the context of reconciliation, this study draws attention to a series of ethical considerations that can inform our thinking about how to create an ethical space of engagement for cross-cultural contracting approaches that is grounded in Indigenous perspectives and a  commitment to improve Indigenous mental health and well-being."
Mental Wellness & Resilience: Co-creating a Collective Vision with Urban Indigenous Communities,"['Josewski, Viviane']",['N/A'],"['Community-Based Participatory Research', 'Cultural Safety', 'Diabetes', 'Health Equity', 'Indigenous Medthologies', 'Indigenous-Led Health Services', 'Mental Health', 'Two-Eyed Seeing']",135000.0,459628,"This research will work with five Friendship/Métis Centres (FC/MCs) in British Columbia to develop a vision for community mental wellness grounded in people's experiences of living with diabetes. Indigenous peoples in Canada face significant mental health and diabetes inequities. Developing effective strategies to address these inequities must include understanding the links between diabetes, mental health, and unique contexts of historical trauma, racism and cultural discontinuity. Urban Indigenous perspectives in health programming remain, however, problematically lacking. As a result, mainstream health services are often ineffective, culturally unsafe, and underused by Indigenous peoples. In contrast, Indigenous-led health services grounded in local Indigenous knowledge(s) improve access to care and wholistic health outcomes for Indigenous peoples. This study builds upon a larger Indigenous-led research partnership between the FC/MCs, the Health Authority and the University of British Columbia - Okanagan. Over the past year, we have worked together to co-develop, implement, and evaluate culturally safe tele-diabetes clinics. In this process, the FC/MCs identified urgent needs to address mental wellness. This research will thus engage FC/MCs, as co-researchers, to: explore community mental wellness needs and priorities, and co-develop recommendations for mapping community-based pathways to mental wellness and resilience. Consistent with Indigenous Methodologies and Two-Eyed Seeing, information gathering and sharing will be facilitated by local Elders, Community Research Liaisons, and Advisory Teams. Methods include environmental scans, Talking Circles, and Community Gatherings. We will co-create a collective vision to guide development of culturally safe wholistic programs aimed at improving mental health and diabetes outcomes, and resilience in urban Indigenous communities. Results will be community-owned and add to knowledge bettering Indigenous health outcomes."
"Mon anxiété ou ton anxiété ? Association entre les marqueurs psychologiques et biologiques de stress et d'anxiété chez les jeunes, leurs parents et leur enseignant","['Journault, Audrey-Ann']",['N/A'],"['Adolescents', 'Anxiété', 'Enfants', 'Programme', 'Promotion', 'Questionnaires']",105000.0,439850,"Un sondage révèle que 59% des Canadiens de 18 à 34 ans considèrent l'anxiété et la dépression comme une épidémie. Bien que la prévalence des troubles anxieux ait augmenté de 8% chez les jeunes, puisque ces données statistiques sont basées sur les critères diagnostiques de troubles anxieux, il est possible qu'elles ne mesurent pas l'ampleur du phénomène énoncé par le public. Les jeunes démontrant une symptomatologie anxieuse qui n'est pas suffisante pour satisfaire les critères d'un diagnostic de trouble anxieux pourraient ainsi passer sous le radar des chercheurs. Or, des études montrent que les personnes expérimentant un niveau élevé de symptomatologie anxieuse seraient plus réactives au stress et que les enfants anxieux à l'école réussissent moins bien, ont une moins bonne santé et vivent plus de détresse. Malgré le manque de connaissances sur la nature de la symptomatologie anxieuse vécue par les jeunes, plusieurs programmes de prévention ont vu le jour dans les dernières années pour ce public cible. Il est donc nécessaire de déterminer rapidement la nature de cette anxiété et quels facteurs y contribuent le plus. Des études ont identifié divers facteurs (individuels, parentaux, scolaires et sociétaux) pouvant jouer un rôle dans le niveau d'anxiété vécu par l'enfant, mais aucune étude n'a encore mesuré conjointement ces différents facteurs, ni comparé la contribution de ceux-ci à l'anxiété des jeunes. Ce projet de recherche vise trois objectifs : (1) déterminer la nature de la symptomatologie anxieuse chez des jeunes Québécois, (2) explorer les influences uniques et partagées des facteurs personnels au jeune, parentaux, scolaires et sociétaux sur leur symptomatologie anxieuse et (3) vérifier si un programme de prévention permet aux jeunes de mieux vivre avec leur symptomatologie anxieuse. Plus de 2000 jeunes ont participé au projet et les analyses sont en cours. Les connaissances générées pourront être intégrées dans de futurs programmes de prévention."
Promoting children's mental health: The effects of a parenting program,"['Joussemet, Mireille', 'Mageau, Geneviève A']","['Dufour, Sarah', 'Koestner, Richard']","['Children Mental Health', 'Parenting Education', 'Primary Prevention', 'Randomized Controlled Trial Design']",309412.0,282595,"Raising children is an important yet challenging responsibility. While research confirms that parents have a vast impact on
their children's adjustment, it has also shown that, to promote children's mental health, parenting must be (1) warm (vs.
harsh), (2) structuring (vs. permissive) and (3) autonomy-supportive (vs. controlling). Unfortunately, knowing how to provide
all of these key ""ingredients"" is not always second nature for parents. In addition, available parenting resources are
sometimes contradictory, abstract, and rarely target all three key parenting components. Providing the general population
with concrete and complete parenting education is essential in improving families' daily lives and in fostering children's
mental health.
The goal of our research project is to evaluate the impact of a parenting program (i.e., How-to program; Faber and
Mazlish, 1980) which aims to teach the three main components of optimal parenting (i.e., warmth, structure, and autonomy
support). In a recent study, we offered the program to 93 parents (11 groups). Results from this first study provide support
for the efficacy of the program in fostering optimal parenting and in improving children's mental health.
The next step is to assess the impact of the How-to parenting program more rigorously. Our goal is to compare
participating parents and their children to families on a wait list, who will attend the program at a later time. We also plan to
obtain teachers' reports of children's adjustment, to gain a more objective evaluation of children's mental health. Finally,
assessments will also take place 6 and 12 months following group participation, to examine whether the program's benefits
are maintained over time. 
Appropriately evaluating the impact of this promising parenting program is a crucial step toward helping parents foster their children's mental health, thereby contributing to our nation's quality of life."

"A Post-Structural Examination of Eating Behaviours, Body Image, and Health in Gay Men Using Photovoice","['Joy, Phillip']",['N/A'],"['Body Image', ""Gay Men'S Health"", 'Nutrition', 'Photovoice', 'Poststructuralism', 'Qualitative Methods']",105000.0,365473,"Nutrition is one of the major lifestyle factors that can impact overall health, including physical, mental, and sexual health. The Nova Scotian government has identified gay men as a priority for improving resources and access to health services.  Gay men often feel isolated from health care professions despite being challenged with many experiences that can increase their health risks.  Homophobia, heterosexism, ideals of masculinity, and cultural pressures within the gay community to look attractive can all play a role in how these men view and maintain their health. To design effective nutritional programs for gay men, research is needed to explore their unique concerns, such as body dissatisfaction, body acceptance, confidentiality, privacy, stress, and a safe environment.  The purpose of this study is to explore how identifying as a gay man influences eating behaviours, body image, and their health. Framed by post-structuralism and queer theories, this qualitative study will strive to break down and understand the role of gender and sexual identities in eating behaviors. The project will be completed in two phases.  Within both phases, 10-15 participants who identify as gay will be recruited. Photovoice, a method that helps participants to express themselves, will be used in Phase 1.  Participants will be asked to take photos of their daily life experiences with food and their body image.  Photos and their meanings will be discussed in small groups to provide the data for this phase.  Phase Two will involve face-to-face interviews to examine more closely how their relationship with food impacts their overall physical, mental, and sexual health. The results of this project will inform health care providers to better service these men and design tailored nutritional interventions for them."

They also face cultural barriers to health service use. An approach to health decision making, called shared decision making (SDM), has been found to improve the participation of people in their healthcare. SDM lowers barriers to healthcare participation by supporting people in their engagement with their health environment and care providers. As well, peer support helps people in the health system as they make decisions about care. The purpose of this study is to develop and then test a SDM strategy used by peer support workers to increase FNIM women's participation in decisions about breast cancer screening.
 
This project has two theory driven phases that will be designed and conducted with an advisory group that includes members of the FNIM communities. First, a review of the literature will identify ways in which SDM tools and approaches can be adapted for use by a range of populations. This information will be used to tailor the SDM strategy with FNIM peer support workers who are currently working in cancer care. We will adapt the strategy until these peer support workers and the advisory board agree that the strategy is ready to test with FNIM women making cancer screening decisions. Next, a new group of FNIM women will be recruited as peer support workers and trained to use the SDM strategy. Each peer will be matched to a FNIM woman who is making a decision about participating in breast cancer screening. The participation and experience of the FNIM peers and women will be evaluated. The research will be used to inform the development of strategies that support people to participate in decisions about their health, and in this way better ensure access to the care they need."

Methods: Our team of Inuit-led and-service providers and researchers from Ontario and Nunavut will work together (""the Team). We will use a collaborative research approach and we will be guided by Inuit societal values in our work. Our plan is to use mixed research methods to do a research study. First, we will use interviews to understand what healthcare providers need to learn so that they are able to support Inuit clients in health decisions. Then, our Team will work together to develop SDM education for health care providers. We will ask some health care provider volunteers to try out the training so that we can learn how to make the SDM education most useful to health care providers. Next, we will invite 20-30 healthcare providers to do the SDM education. We will use surveys and interviews to assess whether the SDM education is helpful for these healthcare providers for making health decisions with Inuit clients. We will also use surveys to ask Inuit clients about their experience with healthcare providers who have done the SDM education. Finally, we will assess how we worked together as a Team to do our study.
Results: In our study we expect to develop and test SDM education for healthcare providers. We will share our experiences and will be an example for other teams who want to work together to do a research study."

Comprehensive investigation of telomere length and its genetic determinants in cancer risk and clinical outcomes,"['Kachuri, Mirlinda']",['N/A'],"['Cancer Epidemiology', 'Cancer Risk Factors', 'Clinical Outcomes In Cancer', 'Gene Environment Interaction', 'Genetic Susceptibility']",105000.0,314344,"Cancers of the lung, head and neck, and pancreas are commonly diagnosed in the Canadian population. However, the prognosis for these cancers remains poor, with low 5-year survival rates for patients with pancreatic (7%) and lung (15%) cancers. There is a need to identify novel predictive and prognostic biomarkers that can serve as targets for prevention and treatment. Focusing on biomarkers that have both genetic and environmental determinants offers a promising avenue in this respect. Telomeres, which are structures that cap the ends of chromosomes, are an example of such a biomarker. Studies have linked variations in telomere length (TL) to cancer susceptibility and other aging-related diseases. Telomeres shorten with age and this can be accelerated by acitivites such as smoking and alcohol consumption. TL also has genetic determinants, and a number of studies have linked these variants with a higher risk of cancer, including lung and pancreatic cancers. However, the underlying biological mechanisms of these variants have not been fully elucidated and the prognostic value of TL and its genetic determinants has not been explored. Therefore, we propose to address these research gaps by investigating the comprehensive genetic profiles and TL with respect to both cancer etiology and progression. This project will use data from the Multicancer Case-control Study in Ontario, which recruited 3300 cancer cases (lung: 1500, head and neck: 1100, pancreas: 700) and 1500 age- and sex-matched controls and collected information on medical and family history, lifestyle factors and environmental exposures. The proposed dissertation work will augment the knowledge on the role of TL and its genetic determinants in cancer risk. Furthermore, it is novel in its aim to comprehensively investigate causal pathways related to TL for disease initiation and progression, and examine TL as a functional node combining the effects of genetic and environmental cancer risk factors."

In normal human cells, telomeres shorten with each round of cell division until they reach a critical length, which triggers cell death. This represents a basic anti-cancer mechanism by limiting cell proliferation, and also serves as a marker for cellular aging. In addition to age-related shortening, telomere attrition can be influenced by modifiable exposures, such as cigarette smoking and physical activity. Several genetic regions have also been implicated in the regulation of telomere length. 
Telomere length as been consistently linked to a number of age-related diseases, including cancer. However, studies of lung cancer have been inconsistent, and it remains unclear whether long or short telomere length is associated with increased risk. In order to clarify the relationship between telomere length and lung cancer, our study employs a novel method called Mendelian Randomization, which uses genetic proxies for telomere length. One of the key advantages of this approach is that genetically inferred telomere length is less vulnerable to bias and reverse-causation, allowing us to better characterize this causal relationship. Using a large sample size of over 25,000 individuals, the results of our work show that longer telomere length confers a higher risk of lung cancer, especially lung adenocarcinoma. In addition to elucidating this relationship, our study also contributes to the development of novel genetic predictors of telomere length."

Over the next five years I plan on further advancing our knowledge around the optimal transition from clinical efficacy to community effectiveness by focusing on the development of innovative, primary healthcare and community-based strategies and models of chronic disease management that are easily implementable, scalable and cost-effective. These strategies will build on my previous research and work of my partners and collaborators and will include: a) pro-active, family practice/primary health care team based strategies of chronic disease management; b) deployment of volunteer peer health educators to support and enhance these activities; c) integration and enhancement of the role played in the management of chronic disease by community-based pharmacists; d) promotion and support of patient-led testing, monitoring, and management of chronic disease; e) incorporation of successful models, strategies and 'lessons learned' from different jurisdictions in Canada and internationally and, e) mobilization of local partners and organizations with complementary foci on community-based chronic disease management strategies.  
I propose to further enhance and foster new links with health-care providers, health-care managers, policy makers and industry partners to accelerate the effective application of research into policies, programs, and practices. I intend to augment mentoring and education opportunities to attract and prepare the next generation of primary care, health services and policy researchers focused on chronic disease management."

Advances in treatment have transformed HIV into a chronic disease [1, 2], enabling a shift towards optimizing quality of life of women living with HIV (WLWH).Navigating sexuality and intimate relationships are among themost difficult aspects of life after an HIV diagnosis[3-11]. Sexual abstinence is common with half of Canadian WLWH reporting being sexually inactive [12]. Sexual dysfunction and dissatisfaction are also common and disproportionately affect WLWH [13, 14] compared to HIV-positive men [15] and HIV-negative women [16, 17]. WLWH navigate their sexual lives among numerous structural threats and stressors, including HIV disclosure obligations and associated risks (e.g., violence, rejection) [18]; threats of HIV criminalization [19]; stigma and discrimination [20]; fears of HIV transmission [21]; and challenges negotiating safer sex [11]. These factors both influence and are influenced by the nature of women’s intimate relationships. Numerous quantitative [e.g., 5, 17, 22, 23] and qualitative [e.g., 24, 25-27] studies show thatrelationship dynamics play a critical rolein determining women’s sexual health. Several studies have explored these associations based on single-item measures of relationships, such as duration, conflict (high vs. low), type (regular vs. casual), or HIV sero-status (discordant vs. concordant). Other studies have gone further to theorize on the multidimensional aspects of sexual partnerships, suggesting that relationship factors interact to differentially predict women’s sexual health outcomes [e.g., 28, 29].This literature is, however, discrepant with no systematic review of the evidence. Moreover, despite long-standing demand from WLWH[30],there remain no evidence-informed and community-driven best practice guidelines for supporting intimacy and sexual health among WLWH. This is in contrast to existing reviews and guidelines in other fields, such as cancer [31, 32] and long-term care [33]. As a result, few providers or programs adequately address sex and relationship difficulties experienced by WLWH [34, 35]. Thus, theoverall goal of this projectis to summarize the evidence concerning sex and intimacy among WLWH and facilitate its uptake into policy/practice to promote healthy relationships and sexuality after HIV. This project involvesthree phases(knowledge synthesis, community consultation, and knowledge translation (KT)) and is led by an establishednationalteam of WLWH, medical and social care providers, policy-makers, and researchers. Inphase 1, we will conduct a rigorous scoping review [36] of intimate relationships among WLWH, their impact on women’s sexual health, and effective interventions. Based on evidence and expert input, we will offer recommendations for best practice and identify research gaps. Inphase 2,we will host an interactive workshop to share the review with end-users and discuss and revise recommendations. Inphase 3, findings will be disseminated to the broader community via 5 linked KT deliverables. Given the gap between research and practice, this project is well-suited to knowledge synthesis and KT and has the potentialto normalize sex and intimacy among WLWH with the ultimate goal of improving quality of life. This project is directly in line with Canadian consensus guidelines for accelerating rights-based, evidence-informed and community-driven responses to priorities of WLWH [37]."

Chronic inflammation and associated diseases cause 60% of deaths globally, and are cited by the WHO as the greatest threat to human health. Complex processes that trigger chronic inflammation, including infection, injury, and psychological distress, alter our health trajectories, especially if they occur in our youth. While biological factors associated with inflammation (infection, stress) have been reasonably well studied, less is known about how markers of socio-structural inequity (poverty, food insecurity, gender-based violence, gender inequity) contribute to inflammation or whether pathways differ by sex and gender.

We will use existing biological specimens and linked survey data from 425 adolescents and young adults (16-24yrs; 60% female) enrolled in the AYAZAZI cohort study (South Africa) to answer new questions about the pathways through which the socio-structural determinants of health (SDoH) affect chronic immune activation, inflammation, and youth health. This study includes three exploratory aims examined for the overall sample and stratified by sex and gender: (1) Characterize inflammation profiles of youth; (2) Determine if key SDoHs are associated with immune profiles of youth; and (3) Examine pathways from SDoHs to inflammation among youth.

Directed acyclic graphs and structural equation models will be used to identify direct and indirect pathways from key SDoH to inflammation, through indicators of health risks and recent stressors. This research will provide novel data to help explain the mechanisms through which socio-structural inequities experienced by youth lead to chronic inflammatory conditions that compromise health during adolescence and in later adulthood. Characterizing the SDoH foundations of inflammation will inform equity-oriented population health interventions for youth in Canada and globally."

Our work on the Relationship and gender EquIty Measurement Among Gender-inclusive Young women and Non-binary youth (REIMAGYN) study is uncovering how youth of diverse genders and sexual orientations understand gender equity in their relationships as well as how existing gender equity measures are not inclusive to their experiences. The proposed project builds on the established community-based research (CBR) infrastructure and findings from REIMAGYN to disseminate knowledge to key stakeholders in gender equity and health among youth and collaboratively identify priority research questions to advance inclusive gender equity measurement. In collaboration with Youth Research Associates (YRAs; youth aged 16-29 with queer and trans identities and experience), community leaders, researchers, and Knowledge Translation & Exchange (KTE) experts, the objectives of this proposal are to: 1. Conduct virtual trainings on KTE to build YRA capacity to identify, create, and disseminate KTE outputs to diverse audiences; 2. Support three YRAs to create KTE outputs (e.g., arts-based, digital) based on REIMAGYN results and disseminate the outputs to stakeholders; and 3. Host an in-person meeting with YRAs and stakeholders to identify research priorities and CBR approaches for advancing inclusive gender equity measurement. By operationalizing principles of CBR and equity during the planning and development of YRA-led KTE outputs, we are seizing an opportunity to contribute to the health, wellbeing, and empowerment of queer and trans youth in Canada."

Gambling problems are two to sixteen times higher in Indigenous communities than in the non- Indigenous population. In partnership with the Kahnawà:ke Shakotiia'takehnhas Community Services (KSCS), the community of Kahnawà:ke and the Research Chair on Gambling, the project aims to engage in a dialogue with the community, and various partners and organizations to identify potential areas of action 1) to support equitable and transparent ways of governing gambling, 2) to implement and sustain preventive actions and health and social services to promote the well-being of the people of Kahnawà:ke. The project embodies a Two-Eyed Seeing approach based on the co-construction of knowledge through both indigenous and non-indigenous ways of knowing. This community led project is based on a mixed methods design including an online survey with community members (N=1,000) and sharing circles with partners, organizations and community members. It will provide a portrait of gambling practices and gambling-related harm in the community of Kahnawà:ke, as well as information on the management of gambling offering and ways to provide services to the community. Our results will be presented at a sharing circle with community members, partners and organizations to validate the initial interpretation of the data and to offer a collective understanding of the needs for services. Co-constructed knowledge will be further shared with the community through traditional activities and popular communication channels and events specific to Kanien'kehá:ka culture. Such activities aim to identify culturally sensitive strategies that will maximize the community's strengths and capacity to respond to their needs while prioritizing the rights to self-determination, respect, dignity and well-being of the people of Kahnawà:ke."

Patient with ADPKD suffer from a poor quality of life and may require dialysis and/or transplantation. Recently, Tolvaptan has been approved by Health Canada as the first drug to slow disease progression. Tolvaptan and other drugs currently in clinical trials are expensive. We need evidence to guide future healthcare policies on the coverage and reimbursement of these drugs. I aim to: 1) determine the risk of disease-related consequences, healthcare utilization, and cost of patients with ADPKD compared to the general population without ADPKD, and patients with other chronic kidney disease; and 2) determine whether the risk of ADPKD complications, healthcare utilization and costs differ between two mutation-based prognostic classes of ADPKD. I hypothesize that the risk of disease-related consequences, healthcare utilization, and cost of patients with ADPKD will be higher compared to the general population, and lower compared to patients with other chronic kidney disease; additionally, it will be higher for mutation-based classes of ADPKD with an expected poor prognosis. I will conduct several population-based cohort studies using the Ontario's healthcare administrative database held at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) Western and the ADPKD registry, which contains clinical, laboratory, and genetic data on patients seen at the ADPKD clinic in Toronto. Statistical and health economical analyses will be conducted to address my objectives. Key findings from these studies will help to: 1) provide evidence to strengthen policy-makers' decisions of drug reimbursement and coverage; 2) inform screening recommendations for extra-renal manifestation of ADPKD; and 3) assist with healthcare resource allocation."

South Asian women, who often live within a wide kinship system, can be influenced by the advice and guidance of their mothers and mothers-in-law.  To learn how to best support pregnant South Asian women, we conducted qualitative interviews with 17 South Asian grandmothers who reside in Southern Ontario, Canada.  The grandmothers emphasized that the pre-conception phase should focus on building healthy habits around nutrition, physical activity, and mental wellness.  Pregnancy should encompass an enriched environment (positive relationships, healthy routines, and nutritional enhancement) and the postpartum phase should emphasize healing and restoration for both the mother and newborn (self-care, bonding, and rebuilding healthy habits).  These stages exist in a cyclical relationship where healing and restoration transitions gradually to re-establishing healthy habits before having a subsequent child."
Perinatal wellbeing in an Aboriginal context: Understanding the health beliefs and cultural perceptions of grandmothers from the Six Nations reserve in Southern Ontario,"['Kandasamy, Sujane']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal Peoples Health', 'Birth', ""Grandmother'S Advice"", 'Health Beliefs', 'Maternal Health', 'Perinatal Health', 'Pregnancy']",750.0,335621,"The health perceptions of women affect their behaviors during milestones such as pregnancy. This is important because healthy pregnancies can reduce risk factors for diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. The health beliefs of women are especially important in Aboriginal communities, who depend on women in their roles as grandmothers, mothers, and aunties to help pass on culture, influencing the wellbeing of children and families.  Little is known about the perinatal health beliefs of Aboriginal grandmothers in Canada-and no studies have explored these perceptions in Six Nations grandmothers.  We interviewed 18 grandmothers from the Six Nations community about what advice they would give a young woman on how to have a healthy pregnancy and care for a baby. We conducted this research in collaboration with the community, who helped us design the study, contact grandmothers, and analyze the data. The grandmothers identified three important pregnancy beliefs: Pregnancy is a natural phase of the life course that is not an illness nor a ""comfort zone""; Pregnancy is a sacred period where balance is key; Optimal health during and after pregnancy is achieved through immunity, security, comfort, social development, and parental responsibility.  The grandmothers also discussed how the community has a responsibility to keep women and babies healthy-it is not just about individual actions (eg: the community should work to strengthen social ties to support mothers). The grandmothers talked about knowledge being shared through stories and by watching/demonstrating when with family and friends. After the research was finished, we produced a film to share the findings. This film was created in collaboration with a Six Nations spoken word artist and in consultation with community members. We hope that these findings will contribute towards increased resilience and strength, and will help inform culturally relevant programs and policies to help women have healthy pregnancies."

Thus, many children and youth spend most of their free time participating in sedentary screen-based activities, which places them at increased risk of developing mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression, obesity, and adult-onset type 2 diabetes. Effective long-term solutions must consider the intersectional context of these families. Nature-based and multi-component health interventions (e.g., access to low-cost outdoor activities, community gardens) offers great opportunity to promote and sustain physical, mental, and social wellbeing. These interventions may be most salient and impactful in communities such as Riverdale in Hamilton, Ontario, which has been identified as an ""arrival community"", whereby many newcomers come to settle when they arrive in Canada. We must, however, be better equipped to meaningfully engage with this unique and heterogeneous population. Therefore, to be in a stronger position to apply for future granting opportunities that are inclusive of new immigrant perspectives and experiences, our planning grant is intended to cultivate new and deep multi-sectoral partnerships between our team of academic partners (McMaster University Chanchlani Research Centre; McMaster Children's Hospital; Brock University Infant/Youth/Child Lab; University of Toronto Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research Consortium) and critical community partners within Riverdale: Local families; Municipal leadership (Neighbourhood Development Sector at the City of Hamilton, Community Action Program for Children Hamilton); Education (Hamilton Wentworth District School Board, Hamilton Wentworth Catholic District School Board); and Community Organizations (Green Venture, The Starfish Canada, Trees for Hamilton, Today's Family)."

For Canada's largest visible minority community, CVD related deaths are decreasing at a significantly slower pace than their European/British ancestry counterparts. South Asian ancestry Canadians experience heart disease at a significantly younger age and have a greater risk of premature death. Researchers have not been able to adequately address the reasons behind the higher prevalence for given the lack of conventional risk factors (i.e. absence of high fat diets, smoking and high rates of obesity). Based on the higher prevalence rate without the presence of conventional risk factors, and newly identified delays in emergency care when heart attack symptoms arise, evaluating how healthcare is accessed can inform if structural barriers are limiting healthcare access. This project aims to understand how one South Asian ancestry community considers, seeks, accesses, values and utilzes cardiovascular disease healthcare; and subsequently what factors shape their CVD healthcare access and uptake. A qualitative approach will be applied to conduct a Critical Ethnography whereby 5-8 cardiac healthcare providers will be interviewed regarding healthcare delivery factors; observational field notes will be collected at cardiac field sites to record how patients are responding to services and interactions with healthcare providers; and finally 30-40 interviews will be conducted with Punjabi ancestry Canadians living with CVD.  Post/colonial, feminist and critical race theory will anchor the qualitative analysis to deliver academic and community based knowledge sharing projects.

About 463 million people were living with Diabetes Miletus (PLWD) in 2019 and the number is projected to rise by 51% by 2045. The high burden of NCDs on the global front has been recognized and included in the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (2). Goal 3 of the UN SDGs is focused on health with target 3.4 aimed at reducing by one-third premature mortality from NCDs through prevention and treatment and promotion of mental health and wellbeing. Currently about 19million people live with diabetes in sub-Saharan Africa, with young people disproportionately affected. SSA is witnessing increases in the risk and prevalence of diabetes and other NCDs due to an epidemiological transition driven by rapid, unprecedented demographic, sociocultural, and economic transitions.  Despite the recognition of the challenges posed by NCDs including diabetes, they remain underfunded and less prioritized and healthcare systems are not re-oriented to deal with NCDs risk in SSA. Effective diabetes management is dependent upon the availability of resources including social support and supportive socio-political environments. Dr. Kangmennaang recently examined diabetes risks and management among PLWDs in underserved communities in Ghana. The findings indicate that that research to guide implementation and the creation of supportive environments is key to addressing the diabetes challenges.

The Effect of Acute Air Pollution Exposure on the Incidence of Appendicitis: A Multi-City Study,"['Kaplan, Gilaad G']","['Dixon, Elijah', 'Johnson, Markey', 'Villeneuve, Paul J', 'Wheeler, Amanda J']","['Air Pollution', 'Appendicitis', 'Case Crossover Design', 'Multi-City', 'Ozone', 'Population-Based']",179133.0,211539,"Surgery for appendicitis is the most common operation performed in young people in Canada. The cause of appendicitis is not known. However, it most commonly occurs in industrial countries such as Canada that produce high levels of air pollution. Scientists have shown that air pollution can cause many problems such as worsening asthma, promoting heart attacks, and increasing the risk of cancer. Air pollution may cause sickness by promoting inflammation. The inflammation driven by air pollution is similar to the inflammation seen in patients who suffer from appendicitis. Thus, it is possible that air pollution may cause inflammation that would result in appendicitis. A recent study demonstrated that air pollution may increase the risk of appendicitis; however, this study needs to be confirmed. Because of this possibility we plan to study whether air pollution increases the risk of being diagnosed with appendicitis.
We plan to look at many people living in Canada who are diagnosed with appendicitis and see if they are more likely to have appendicitis on days when air pollution is highest. Our hypothesis is that individuals who are exposed to higher levels of air pollution will be more likely to be diagnosed with appendicitis. 
Linking air pollution to the development of appendicitis is important. If air pollution increases the risk of developing appendicitis, then lowering air pollution may prevent some cases of appendicitis. Discovering such a relationship would potentially give us the tools to prevent appendicitis - a far more effective strategy then subjecting people to operations once it has occurred."

Additionally, we will explore whether factors such as age, gender, smoking, and other health conditions like diabetes increase the susceptibility to heart attacks after exposure to air pollutants. By doing this we hope to identify those individuals who are at highest risk for heart attack after being exposed to higher levels of air pollution. Air pollution exposure is modifiable risk factor and thus, our efforts are geared towards the prevention of heart attacks. Health Canada's Air Quality Health Index provides real-time air pollution data that protects Canadians from short-term elevations of air pollutants. When air pollution in a community rises to harmful levels, the Air Quality Health Index warns Canadians to avoid exposure. Our findings may improve the Air Quality Health Index. Characterizing the relationship between air pollution and the development of heart attacks may further motivate policy makers to reduce emissions and hence potentially prevent cardiovascular diseases - a far more effective strategy then treating people after they get sick."

It is a major risk factor for child mortality and is responsible for up to 17% of child deaths worldwide. Stunting is also associated with reduced physical and cognitive capacity, poor school achievement and reduced income potential in adult life. In Cambodia, stunting prevalence is high, affecting about 40% of children. We have little information on the causes of stunting in this population. Speculated contributors include micronutrient deficiencies, inflammation and other genetic factors (hemoglobin disorders), but it is not known to what extent. These genetic hemoglobin disorders affect about 55% of the Cambodian population and result in a defective structure of hemoglobin, the protein found in red blood cells that carries oxygen. These disorders can both cause anemia and confound the diagnosis of nutritional anemia. It is important to distinguish between nutritional anemia (that is treatable) and anemia of other causes (i.e. genetic disorders) in order to advise appropriate public health interventions and thereby prevent child undernutrition.
This retrospective cohort study aims to: 1) define the cumulative incidence of stunting (height-for-age) in Cambodian children 6-59 months of age; 2) investigate correlates between stunting and risk factors including micronutrient deficiencies, inflammation and genetic hemoglobin disorders; and 3) determine if anemia is more related to nutrition (micronutrient deficiencies) or other causes (genetic disorders).
This research is highly relevant to policy makers in regions with high rates of stunting, anemia and hemoglobin disorders, namely South East Asia; and globally to all countries with high rates of stunting given the sheer magnitude of this global health problem. In Canada, this research is relevant to understanding the diagnosis of anemia and for guiding policy on the treatment of anemia and prenatal genetic counseling in this population."

Opioid-related fatal overdoses account for most drug ODs. Significant surges in opioid-related ODs in the past few years have been particularly attributed to the influx of North America's illicit drug supply with fentanyl and its analogues. While several studies have tried to assess individual-level risk factors of fatal and non-fatal overdoses, there is a need for neighborhood-level studies on opioid-related overdoses to identify neighborhoods at highest risk of opioid-related overdose and inform the implementation of targeted overdose prevention interventions. The objectives of this study are: 1) Summarizing the literature on neighborhood-level predictors of fatal and non-fatal opioid-related overdoses; 2) Characterizing the spatial trends and predictors of opioid-related fatal and non-fatal overdoses from 2014-2020 in Rhode Island, USA (i.e., a setting with one of the highest rates of drug ODs in North America); 3) Identifying neighborhoods vulnerable to future illicit fentanyl-involved ODs in Rhode Island, USA. Question 1 will be addressed through a systematic literature review and data synthesis of neighborhood-level risk factors of opioid-related overdose by searching several electronic scientific databases. Question 2 will be addressed using a large, linked, statewide dataset, and exploratory spatial data analysis. Question 3 will be addressed using spatial machine learning methods and timely surveillance data. This study will be conducted in collaboration with Rhode Island's Department of Health, the Governor's overdose task force, and representatives from treatment programs and community-based agencies. Ultimately, this study will inform the implementation of harm reduction and other public health interventions aimed at reducing opioid-related overdoses in North America."

Furthermore, our understanding of factors that determine early cessation or predict sustained injecting among recent initiates remains very limited. Therefore, this study proposes to employ longitudinal data analyses to characterize early injecting careers, with a focus on the individual (e.g., childhood trauma, drug use patterns) and social-structural (e.g., homelessness, incarceration) factors that shape injection initiation, early cessation of injecting, and sustained injecting. Findings of this study are essential to developing meaningful and effective policy and program interventions that seek to prevent early injecting careers from progressing to sustained injecting."

It occurs when tissue similar to the inner lining of the uterus grows outside of the uterus. Tissue from endometriosis often grows in other organs of the reproductive system, which can lead to infertility in many patients. Endometriosis patients also have higher rates of adverse events during pregnancy and birth, such as gestational diabetes or preterm birth. There are several different treatments for endometriosis, including surgeries and hormonal therapies. However, there remains a need to better understand reproductive outcomes after various endometriosis treatments, as the research comparing treatments is still unclear.

In this project, I seek to understand the role of endometriosis treatments in relation to various pregnancy outcomes. I will investigate which endometriosis treatments are associated with higher chances of becoming pregnant and giving birth. I will also examine which treatments are associated with lower chances of complications during pregnancy and labour and delivery. For these investigations, I will analyze data from females who lived in British Columbia between 2000 and 2021 and were diagnosed with endometriosis. In addition, I will interview endometriosis patients about how they considered different treatments if they knew they wanted to get pregnant in the future.

This research will help us understand if certain endometriosis treatments are better for patients who want to get pregnant, so patients and doctors can make more informed decisions about their care. Results will also provide insight into how endometriosis patients decide between treatment options and how they may be better supported in their decision-making process."

This condition can lead to a range of symptoms, such as trouble walking, fatigue, and vision problems. MS mainly affects young adults and is a major cause of disability in this age group. Around the world, nearly 3 million people live with MS.
Before clear symptoms of MS appear, a period known as the ""prodromal"" phase may occur, which can last months to years. In this phase, people may have subtle signs or symptoms that suggest MS might develop later on. Recognizing individuals in this early phase is crucial, as they might benefit from early treatments, and perhaps delay or even prevent the more severe symptoms.
While some studies have given us hints about this prodromal phase, no reliable method has yet been established to predict who is in this phase. Our team aims to change this by creating a special tool (an algorithm) that can calculate the likelihood of someone being in this early phase.
To build this tool, we are studying over two decades of health data from British Columbia (BC), Canada. To test the tool's effectiveness, we are applying it to similar health data from Sweden. We will compare the information of those who later developed MS with those who did not, looking for patterns. These patterns include previous doctor visits, medication use, age, and more. Using advanced data analysis techniques, we will test different combinations of these patterns to see which best predicts the MS prodromal phase.
By the end of our research, we hope to have a reliable tool that can calculate a person's risk of being in the early stages of MS. Such a tool can revolutionize how we approach MS. It can help researchers find potential participants for clinical trials testing new treatments, allow doctors to manage the disease earlier, and most importantly, offer people a chance to tackle MS before it fully sets in."

Those who survive are at an increased risk for repeated infections, chronic diseases, poor physical and mental development, and poor economic prosperity later in life. Infants and children between 0-23 months of age are particularly vulnerable to the detrimental effects of undernutrition. This formative period therefore offers a window of opportunity for promoting healthy growth and improving child survival. Child undernutrition remains a devastating problem in Pakistan, with one in three children reported to be underweight, four in 10 too short for one's age, and almost one in five dangerously thin for one's height. Current research suggests that although low household wealth is an important constraint, infections, cultural norms, beliefs, and maternal knowledge are important factors contributing to undernutrition. This study will take place in the Rahim Yar Khan District of Punjab, Pakistan. Aligned with the current literature, the goals are to rehabilitate moderately malnourished children 7-9 months of age and enable mothers to sustain rehabilitation in their home by improving household feeding and childcare practices. The study team will engage the community to identify uncommon but successful behaviors practiced by local mothers of well-nourished children from economically disadvantaged homes, and transfer these to mothers with undernourished children who are equally disadvantaged in the wider study community. We will collect pre-intervention data to learn about the uncommon practices and design the intervention. Mothers and interested family will come together in a home-like setting to rehabilitate their malnourished child and learn new behaviors to sustain growth in their home. Home visits, print information and community events will reinforce key messages. Data will be collected during and post-intervention, and findings will be shared with the local and global community."

Leveraging cross-sectional accelerometry to emphasize weather's role in active living policy,"['Katapally, Tarun R']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1498.0,324487,"Physical activity has many benefits and is one of the cheapest and simplest ways to reduce the impact of chronic diseases that cost Canadian economy millions of dollars each year. Despite this evidence, physical inactivity is very prevalent among Canadians. Over the years, many physical activity interventions have been implemented but failed to produce major changes. Thus, to enable a population-wide change, a new approach has gained moment: active living interventions. The goal of these interventions is to modify the built environment that surrounds us to facilitate us to move more and sit less. For example, an active living intervention could be the creation of more sidewalks for people to walk. 

However, one factor that is consistently ignored in developing these interventions is the role played by weather. For example, how we use a sidewalk will depend on how safe or unsafe we feel in using a sidewalk in different seasons. Modifying built environment without considering weather in all seasons will only be partially effective. This is especially true in Canada where we see a wide variation of weather in a year, and this variation differs from place to place. So, we need interventions that are specific to each city or town depending on the weather variation encountered in those places.

Currently we do not have evidence on how built environment mitigates the detrimental effect of weather to increase opportunities for physical activity. We need to conduct long term country-wide studies which would be quite expensive. Thus, we have devised an innovative method that matches existing physical activity data collected over decades across Canada with place-specific weather data. Such matching will enable us to understand how built environment interacts with weather in different places in Canada to ultimately influence physical activity. Eventually, this method will inform future active living interventions that will help increase the physical activity of Canadians."

This research focuses on the public's beliefs, perceptions and knowledge regarding MCI. Although some research exists on dementia literacy there is a gap in understanding the subjective dimension regarding how older individuals perceive their experiences and conceptualize cognitive deficits. The team of two sociologists and one psychologist addresses this gap by pursuing three original research activities: a) A theoretical and historical examination of the memory sciences and the development of MCI as a disease category, b) An analysis of the psychological and clinical testing and development of memory-drug hypotheses and products, c) A sociological qualitative investigation, through focus groups and interviews with older adults, caregivers and professionals, to discover the meaning, experiences, attitudes and consequences of cognitive impairment and its treatments in everyday contexts.  The research will also discuss the relevant ethical controversies which have arisen around enhancement interventions aimed at treating memory loss.  MCI is an ideal opportunity to investigate wider social patterns that connect the fields of aging and memory, and the social determinants of health and dementia.  The goal is to produce better ways of understanding MCI that expand beyond the disease model to include the influence of social relationships and the role of professional care.  This research can also aid in the evaluation of MCI by adding a rich interdisciplinary inquiry into what MCI means today and how best our cultures of expertise (clinical, pharmacological, psychogeriatric) and individuals diagnosed with MCI can participate in a shared agenda for aging well in the face of cognitive impairment."
Enabling the monitoring and advancement of knowledge on exposure to cannabis use.,"['Kaufman, Pamela E']","['Pisko, Laura A', 'Chaiton, Michael O', ""O'Connor, Shawn"", 'Schwartz, Robert M']","['Cannabis Use', 'Environmental Exposure', 'Secondhand Cannabis Smoke']",100000.0,372886,"With the legalization of recreational cannabis in Canada proposed for July 2018, we expect to see changes in how and where cannabis is used. Studies show that exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke results in harms that are similar to tobacco smoke. Social exposure to cannabis use may also have an impact on the normalization of cannabis use among young people. In order to minimize any potential negative impacts from the legalization of cannabis, it is important to understand who is exposed (physically and socially) to cannabis, how much they are exposed, and in what ways, locations and circumstances they are exposed. We will analyze data from a cross-sectional population survey (CAMH Monitor) of Ontarians to understand cannabis exposure and patterns of use before legalization. These data will serve as an essential baseline for comparison after legalization. We will also develop an informatics monitoring system containing analyzed population data on cannabis exposure and use from multiple sources. These data will be shared with public health practice and research communities through an accessible online portal. Users will be able to download graphs and charts for key cannabis indicators by gender/sex, age, education, geographic location and other factors. In addition, we will conduct interviews and focus groups with young adults and youth to better understand how they are impacted by exposure to cannabis. The findings from our study will inform policy and interventions to minimize harms from exposure to cannabis use, and support the development of future research related to the impacts of cannabis use and exposure on public health and social outcomes."
"Inflamm-aging: What do we know about the effect of inflammation on HIV treatment and disease as we age, and how does this affect our search for a Cure?","['Kaul, Rupert']","['Reinhard, Robert J', 'Rosenes, Ron', 'Ostrowski, Mario A']","['Aging', 'Hiv', 'Immunology', 'Inflammation']",3000.0,288272,"HIV infection causes substantial inflammation. Inflammation is a natural biological defense reaction to attacks on the body by a virus, bacteria or even a physical injury. But long term inflammation can cause harm, even after a person starts on effective antiretroviral therapy. Inflammation may affect brain function, accelerated aging, premature frailty, transmission of HIV and the possibility of an eventual HIV cure. This Cafe will discuss CIHR-funded research related to ""inflamm-aging"". Dr. Rupert Kaul and Dr. Mario Ostrowski, together with community scholars and research collaborators Dr. Ron Rosenes and Mr. Robert Reinhard, will discuss the findings and community implications of their CIHR-funded research from 3 projects: 1. CIHR team grant in HIV vaccine discovery: novel mechanisms and strategies of protection; 2. Defining the clinical and immune causes of disproportionately high HIV levels in semen; and 3. CIHR emerging HIV team grant: the role of common co-infections in HIV susceptibility, immunopathogenesis and secondary transmission. We will focus on the following areas that are of wide interest to the HIV/AIDS community: how HIV damage in the gut causes inflammation, why standard cART along is very slow to reverse this damage, and whether complementary therapies might help; how HIV causes ""exhaustion"" of many important immune cells, and how this process might be reversed to improve health outcomes. The venue will be the Vic Public House, and the event is timed to coincide with the 2013 OHTN Conference, which draws HIV/AIDS community members, service providers and researchers to Toronto from across Ontario. The main goal is to stimulate discussion between the broad HIV/AIDS community and CIHR-supported research experts. With the information technology assistance of the OHTN, we will webcast the Cafe, allowing knowledge users from AIDS Service Organizations and geographically disparate individuals to hear what is said and to join the discussion."
Identification of myocardial injury in the emergency setting using a biomarker panel and the next generation of high-sensitive cardiac troponin tests,"['Kavsak, Peter A']","['Hill, Stephen A', 'Jaffe, Allan S', 'Oremus, Mark', 'Worster, Andrew', 'You, John J']","['Biomarker Panels', 'Cardiac Troponin', 'Emergency Department', 'Health Outcomes', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Ordering Protocol']",166179.0,180810,"There are many things that may cause someone to feel chest pain; however, what everyone is worried most about and wants to know is if the pain is from a heart attack. This is an important question that both the patient and the doctor in the emergency room (ER) would like to have an answer to so that the best available care can be given as fast as possible.  

To help the doctor decide if a heart attack is happening, blood tests are often used. Unfortunately, the current available blood tests are not very useful for early identification of heart injury in patients who arrive to the ER soon after they experience chest pain. In fact, experts suggest to measure these blood tests at least 6 hours (even up to 24 hours) after the patient comes to the ER before deciding that the patient is not having a heart attack.  Obviously, this increases the wait time in the hospital before the patient can go home and also increases the overall wait time in the ER.

Our study's goal is to use new blood tests to see if a heart attack can be identified within the first 90 minutes in the ER (as opposed to 6 hours).  We plan to test a panel of blood tests as well as newer versions of the current blood test (troponin) in 600 patients who arrived within a couple of hours to the ER after their chest pain started.  Patients are excluded from the study if their chest pain is due to other conditions besides ischemic heart disease (e.g., trauma).   We believe that our study will show that early detection of heart attacks is possible and will also provide additional information on those patients who did not suffer a heart attack in the ER, but are at high risk for suffering a future heart attack (i.e., within 1 month as well as 1 year later).  Newer & better blood tests are the best options for detecting heart attacks faster and reducing the wait times in the ER to arrive at this diagnosis."

And with increasing concerns for obesity among children and particularly among boys, this research addresses a relatively unexplored set of questions about the relationship between the masculine body, gender identities, long term healthy lifestyle practices, and schooling. This study contributes to a deepening knowledge of the impact interactions of boys among boys in a health education context has when masculine norms and cultural understandings influence how boys understand body image issues. Our international study extends previous CIHR funded initiatives that have actively and clearly revealed emerging national and international concerns for the intersection of hyper-visible male adolescent body images, violence, homophobia, and health promotion.

The evidence intersecting adolescent boys' bodies in a context dominated by heteronormativity and underwritten by a climate of homophobia contributes to the silencing of anxieties about adolescent male body issues. This research addresses the enhanced health and participation of a sub population of adolescent boys who currently remain marginalized by more privileged bodied boys.  Health promotion and prevention is central in this research.  Our aims include: 1) identifying and recording adolescent body image concerns from youth across three commonwealth countries, namely Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia, 2) examining the global and local impact that a burgeoning hyper-visibilized adolescent masculine body image is having on adolescent male participation in school health education and 3) questioning the intersecting barriers of adolescent normative masculinity, homophobia and violence in locker room spaces."
Direct Funded Home Care for Older People in Ontario,"['Kelly, Christine']","['Aubrecht, Catherine M', 'Bourgeault, Ivy L', 'Grenier, Amanda M', 'Hande, Mary Jean E', 'Martin-Matthews, Anne E', 'Williams, Allison M']","['Aging', 'Disability', 'Gender', 'Health Inequalities', 'Health Policy', 'Health Services', 'Home Care', 'Qualitative Methods']",267575.0,344425,"Canadian home care systems are urgently in need of an overhaul.[1] There is increased demand due to aging demographics and because cultural norms now support home and community-based care over long-term residential care. It is difficult to recruit and retain workers to these fields, client needs are increasingly complex, and the system is infamously fragmented.[2] Direct Funding (DF) models of home care are innovative policy mechanisms designed to address some of these issues.[3] DF provides individuals with cash to hire and manage workers instead of receiving services through a home care agency. People with disabilities and older people in other countries report high levels of satisfaction with the flexibility, cultural sensitivity and autonomy linked to receiving DF home care, although the results for workers are mixed. 

Ontario is piloting DF for older adults in 2016. The proposed study aims to conduct primary research using qualitative methods to explore this development. Our research question is: How do DF programs shape the experiences, working conditions, policy landscape, and theoretical implications of community care? This project will also consider whether DF programs attend to inequalities related to disability, gender, racialization and immigration. The study includes an analysis of media and grey literature documents found in the public domain, interviews with policy makers, home care workers, older adults, and their families, and an international workshop to explore DF. 

The team includes seven established and emerging interdisciplinary qualitative health researchers, three community partners and one government collaborator. The knowledge created through this project will have value to Ontario policymakers to refine the program being studied and other DF programs, community organizations to inform their members, academics working around care theory, and individuals exploring their home care and work options."
Is it Criminal to have HIV?  Barriers to Knowing your Status.,"['Kelly, Deborah V']","['Burt, Kimberley', 'Yetman, Gerard F']","['Hiv Criminalization', 'Hiv Stigma', 'Hiv Testing', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Point Of Care Testing']",3000.0,288186,"Rates of HIV infection continue to rise in Canada and in Newfoundland and Labrador (NL); however rates of HIV testing have declined in this province.  Up to 26% of those infected with HIV do not know their status, therefore barriers to HIV testing must be identified, discussed and overcome.  It is recommended that HIV testing should become a routine part of medical care, but concerns about confidentiality, fear of stigma and discrimination, and accessible HIV testing have all been identified as barriers to getting tested. 

The risk of being criminally charged if someone has HIV and does not disclose their HIV status to sexual partners before having sex is another barrier to 'knowing your status'. This criminalization, or 'law and order' approach, serves to stigmatize people living with HIV and undermines proven HIV prevention strategies and programs. Point of care testing or 'rapid HIV tests' may help overcome some of the barriers by providing more testing opportunities for those with less access to medical care or for those with privacy concerns, while also reducing the anxiety associated with waiting for HIV test results. Presently, point of care testing for HIV is not available in NL as it is in other provinces. Education about the use, advantages and disadvantages of point of care testing is needed.  

This Café Scientifique event will provide an opportunity for the public to engage in dialogue with a panel of experts and renowned scientists about barriers to HIV testing, and point of care testing as a potential solution. Issues related to criminalization of HIV, along with the associated problems of stigma and discrimination, will also be discussed. This session will be of interest to the general public, including those at risk of and living with HIV.

So far there is not much reliable evidence, but this post-COVID-19 condition, also called ""long COVID"" or ""long-haul COVID,"" may affect up to ten percent of COVID patients. As with COVID-19 itself, some people seem to be more affected than others, but it is not yet clear what social factors (such as sex, age, ethnicity, and income) might be involved. Another area where evidence is lacking is how other health conditions, such as diabetes, asthma or depression, may interact with COVID-19 to worsen or even prevent long COVID. Ontario collects data on health care use that can be analysed to produce evidence about long COVID. However, doing these kinds of analyses, where there are a lot of variables involved, is complicated and requires some special methods. Artificial intelligence is well suited to this kind of research, because it is very good at classifying and categorizing data with a lot of different features. Our research project will use artificial intelligence to look at the health care use of people in Ontario who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, to see what kind of relationship there is between social factors, existing health conditions, and long COVID. We will engage with community groups and patient groups to help us interpret our findings, and post them in visual form on a publicly available website. Our findings will give policymakers and healthcare decision-makers evidence they need to come up with interventions that are better at preventing and managing COVID-19."

In theory, access to HIV and Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) services is guaranteed. Integrating HIV and SRH, especially preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission and unwanted pregnancies among women with HIV, promotes the health of women and children, and is cost-effective. Unfortunately, my previous research shows that despite federal funds to provide contraceptives for all women, HIV testing during prenatal care, and anti-HIV medications during pregnancy and labour and delivery, these services are not consistently available in public clinics and hospitals. 
My post-doctoral research will generate proposals to improve accountability in the delivery of HIV and SRH services in Mexico. Working with policy-makers and affected women, I will identify culturally appropriate, politically feasible mechanisms to empower low-income women, including those living with HIV, to demand their health rights. Increased access to HIV and SRH services will improve individual and population health and contribute to achieving the health-related Millennium Development Goals by reducing child and maternal mortality and tackling the expansion of the HIV pandemic. 
HIV does not respect national boundaries and threatens social and economic development globally. Reversing the HIV pandemic is a public good in our interdependent world. My research is especially relevant for Canadians given increasing social and economic exchange with Mexico through migration and trade. Canada is an important leader in international maternal-child health, and my research will contribute to achieving the goals of the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health. My research is consistent with CIHR's mandate to develop research capacity which addresses global health challenges in a priority country (Mexico) by preventing and controlling pandemics, strengthening health policy and health systems, and advancing gender equality."

Pourtant, le tabagisme demeure un problème majeur de santé publique au Québec, malgré les initiatives développées pour lutter contre ce fléau. Outre ses effets néfastes sur la santé générale, le tabagisme influence négativement la santé buccodentaire et constitue l'une des premières causes du cancer buccal. Dans ce contexte, les dentistes du Québec sont encouragés à utiliser le guide de pratique clinique canadien de renoncement au tabac. Face à ce défi, l'objectif poursuivi par ce projet de recherche est de comprendre les facteurs liés à l'environnement clinique du dentiste, les facteurs structurels et institutionnels qui influencent positivement ou négativement l'utilisation d'au moins un des énoncés du guide canadien de renoncement au tabac (demander, conseiller, évaluer, assister et référer) avec les adultes fumeurs qui visitent leur clinique dentaire. Pour répondre à cet objectif, des entrevues téléphoniques ou au sein de la clinique dentaire d'une durée moyenne de 45 minutes ont été menées auprès de 20 dentistes à travers la province. L'outil de collecte de données a été développé en se basant sur les théories scientifiques. Les données ont été enregistrées et transcrites pour être analysées. L'analyse préliminaire des résultats montre que le leadership du dentiste, la disponibilité des ressources, la dynamique des cliniques dentaires, le type de pratique, les facteurs économiques et les structures intervenant dans la formation des dentistes sont autant de paramètres qui ont un impact sur l'utilisation du guide canadien de renoncement au tabac en clinique dentaire privée au Québec.

With the emergence of a new disease like COVID-19, there is the potential for significant fear, stigmatization, and misinformation. It is essential to understand how these phenomenon operate; to trace how they affect public attitudes, fears, and beliefs; and to support evidence-based communication by government and expert public health sources that can help to minimize panic or stigmatization, support the adoption of appropriate precautions, and promote effective and pro-social responses.

We combine four data sources (a nationally-representative survey sampling 300,000 Canadian households three times over the next two years; follow-up interviews with 135-165 participants; social media data; and mainstream media discourse analyses) to investigate a series of research questions surrounding public perceptions, fears, and reactions. The survey and interviews will provide core data on public perceptions of the risk of COVID-19, who Canadians are turning to as experts on the topic, and what information they are seeking. We correlate this data with analyses of the content being shared through social and traditional media platforms.

This project supports the response to COVID-19. By better understanding Canadian risk perceptions, fears, and information sources, we can support the development and testing of more effective strategies for sharing reliable information and garnering trust. Longitudinal, cross-Canada surveying allows for regional analysis of interventions, rapid identification of what information Canadians are seeking, and the creation of pathways for sharing public knowledge and opportunities for engagement."

Among the 10,000 children currently in out-of-home placement, an estimated 33% of children were removed within the first year of life, of which more than half were removed at birth, the overwhelming majority of whom are First Nations and Metis. Whereas out-of-home placement is a widely recognized factor influencing children's health and development, little research has focused on the effects of placement during infancy on the later health of children and virtually no research has extended examination to the health of their mothers. As strategies to prevent separation of mothers and infants, particularly newborns, are an increasingly urgent priority for Indigenous leaders, better understanding of the role of placement in infancy is vital both to provide a fuller picture of its impacts and to identify optimal leverage points for reducing inequities in family wellbeing. To address this knowledge gap, I will draw on innovative methods to analyze longitudinal, linked administrative data for the entire Manitoba population of mothers and their offspring. I will investigate whether placement in infancy differentially impacts the health of First Nations, Metis and non-Indigenous mothers and children compared to those who experience placement later in childhood or who remain together. This study is expected to uncover whether and how inequities in health are characterized in the lives of mothers and children who are separated in early life, and to inform equity-based and Indigenous-led interventions to preserve maternal-infant bonds, address unique health challenges of this population, and shorten time to reunification. Translation of findings will occur in collaboration with an advisory team of Indigenous organizations to ensure their relevance in advancing initiatives that benefit well-being of Indigenous families and promote greater health equity in the population at large."

These conditions, which resemble ""long COVID"" or Post-Acute COVID-19 Syndrome (PACS), and include Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), present unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. The often elusive nature of these syndromes leads to under-diagnosis and less-than-optimal care, thus complicating effective patient management. Tackling these multifaceted challenges necessitates a concerted effort to strengthen the healthcare system's responsiveness and capacity for coordinated, multidisciplinary care, along with a deeper understanding of the specific needs and experiences of individuals affected by complex chronic AEFIs. This project aims to proactively create a multidisciplinary network encompassing researchers, clinicians, policymakers, and individuals with direct experience of complex AEFIs. Dedicated to improving the understanding and management of these syndromes, the network seeks to establish research priorities and develop an inclusive framework to enhance practices in diagnosing, reporting, treating, and researching these conditions, and their relationships to vaccination. The project's structured stakeholder engagements and network development activities, environmental scan, and international hybrid workshop represent increment steps towards a cohesive and informed strategy for managing complex AEFIs in Canada. By focusing on these rare but essential health issues, the project aims to lay the groundwork for healthcare strategies specifically designed for the unique requirements of those affected.

While there are a number of effective interventions to mitigate drug-related harm, including drug-based addiction treatment, there remain significant gaps in our ability to address the alarming human, social and economic costs of illicit drugs. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are therefore being initiated in Vancouver to examine the efficacy of novel addiction treatment and harm mitigation strategies. However, past RCTs among marginalized populations have identified issues of significant consequence to experiences of trial participation and the effective and ethical execution of RCTs. These issues have significantly impacted the success of trial-based research, but have focused on individual- and trial-level attributes that have not been fully explored in the unique context of addiction RCTs. This grant therefore proposes a program of research companion to addiction RCTs in Vancouver that examines the individual, and social, structural dimensions of addiction RCT participation among people who use drugs. It seeks to (1) examine the individual, social and structural determinants of motivations, barriers and willingness to participate in addiction RCTs; (2) assess the individual, social and structural correlates of RCT trial preparedness; (3) explore attitudes about and experiences of addiction RCT participation, before, during, and following trial completion; and (4) identify individual, social and structural determinants of protocol adherence and trial participation completion. By partnering with addiction RCTs this research will focus on actual rather than hypothetical research scenarios and evaluate participation dimensions longitudinally from pre-trial preparedness through to post-trial reflection."

Previous research has documented escalations in high-intensity drug use, overdose, hospital discharge against medical advice, drug and alcohol related death and public disorder that coincide with monthly cheque issue days.  Service providers further report large spikes in service utilization that extend provders beyond institutional capacity, resulting in wait times, suboptimal service provision or clients leaving without accessing care. There is a therefore a pressing need to examine alternative disbursement arrangements' ability to mitigate these considerable drug-related harms. This grant proposes a 26-week, parallel, multi-armed assessor blinded randomized controlled trial to test the impact of alternative disbursement arrangements on the escalation of drug-related harms coinciding with cheque issue day in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside neighbourhood. This study will be conducted in partnership with a local credit union specifically designed to provide access to financial services for local residents. Study participants in non-control arms will have their social assistance deposited directly into a personalized account at the partner credit union and disbursed according to a schedule that varies disbursement. This trial will monitor the impact of alternative social assistance disbursement on intensified drug use (primary outcome), and other key drug use, service utilization, treatment discontinuation and public disorder-related outcomes.

The ultimate goal of this program is to improve health services, policies and outcomes specific to illicit drug use through a thematically linked program that integrates research, knowledge translation and the training of new scientists.

The specific objectives of this program of research are:

1. To identify the impact of individual and social-structural factors on access to and integration of evidence-based addiction treatment and harm reduction programs within acute and community healthcare settings;

2. To identify the impact of access to addiction treatment and harm reduction programs on overdose, HIV and HCV risk and treatment outcomes;

3. To describe and evaluate novel harm reduction programs in Canada, with a focus on drug consumption facilities;

4. To provide a platform for knowledge translation and the ongoing training of new scientists studying illicit drug use."

Medical care and retirement income pressures are top of mind for government officials and health practitioners as the Baby Boom generation retires.  At the same time, the sustainability of these programs is key for younger generations who also hope to have an opportunity to benefit.

The Chair in Generational Equity and Health will build a cutting edge research and knowledge translation hub that focuses on federal and provincial policy interventions which shape the distribution of public resources between the needs of an aging population and early childhood as a determinant of lifelong health.  This research will provide policy makers, practitioners, students and the general public with high quality, comprehensive generational analyses to inform priority setting in the health care system and for investments in the determinants of health.

The social determinants now pose growing challenges for Generations X and Y.  After adjusting for inflation, Canadians under age 45 start their families earning lower wages and paying higher housing prices than did their parents a generation ago.  While there are interventions to mitigate these challenges, their implementation is impeded by dynamics that create an imbalance in public spending across generations.  Presently, Canadians under 45 are less likely to vote at the same rate as older Canadians.  So long as this age gap persists, all political parties are less likely to organize platforms in response to issues that primarily impact younger generations.  In response, the research produced by the Chair in Generational Equity and Health will be used to scale up and evaluate an inter-sectoral population health intervention designed to reduce the age gap in political engagement - a gap that currently impedes Canada's ability to promote health equity over the life course."

The first is through work with OHESI (the Ontario HIV Epidemiology Surveillance Initiative) which monitors HIV/AIDS surveillance in Ontario. This includes novel surveillance research in Ontario including modeling of missing data within the HIV testing and diagnosis data and modeling of misclassified data based on the HIV test requisitions and Laboratory Enhancement Program form (LEP, completed after a confirmatory HIV positive test) to more accurately identify HIV diagnoses within key populations, race/ethnicity and exposure category. Currently, rates of HIV diagnoses based on these indicators are unable to be published as missing data would skew the results. Second, I work with novel pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) data from IQVIA and am creating a mathematical model of PrEP eligibility based on key population in Ontario. This work aims to model the estimated cost of the Ministry providing free PrEP in Ontario. Third, the OHTN Cohort Study (OCS) is the largest prospective cohort study of people living with HIV in Ontario. My work within the OCS has spanned topics such as looking at  HIV and STI testing history among PLWH prior to their HIV diagnosis, and how PLWH faced vulnerabilities, trauma and show resiliency in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. I would like to increase my understanding of how to apply for funding to create a sub-study within the OCS.

Understanding the Role of Contrasting Urban Contexts in Healthy Aging: An International Study of Daily Mobility and Active Living Using Wearable Sensor Devices across Cohorts,"['Kestens, Yan']",['N/A'],"['Accelerometry', 'Gis', 'Gps', 'Healthy Aging', 'Mixed Methods', 'Mobility', 'Neighbourhood Effects', 'Physical Activity', 'Social Participation', 'Spatial Epidemiology']",115733.0,258304,"!see proposal for entire abstract!
Background: Research has shown that key factors of healthy aging such as level of physical activity, social participation or mobility can vary depending on where older adults live. Yet we still fail to understand how environments influence healthy aging. In a context of aging populations and growing urbanization, calls have been issued for more sustainable urban (re-)development and implementation of local solutions to address global environmental and health issues. To date, few studies have accounted for daily mobility of older adults in order to understand how individual social, cultural or financial resources and the characteristics of life environment interact to produce healthy aging profiles.
However, novel sensors such as GPS devices or accelerometers - which measure the level of energy we spend - now make it possible to gather precise information on people's daily mobility, levels of physical activity, or to assess perceptions or feelings at given times. Combining such data with classical questionnaires on perceived environments and qualitative assessment of experience of places opens new opportunities to better understand how the environments we live in influence healthy aging. 
Objective: Consequently, this project aims to develop an international platform and research agenda to collect and analyse detailed data on daily mobility and health outcomes among older adults participating in two existing cohorts and one developing cohort and living in contrasted urban settings in three large cities: Montreal, Paris and Luxembourg. 
Methods: Participants in these cohorts will wear a device that will automatically collect information on location (GPS) and physical activity (accelerometer) for a period of seven days. They will also answer questionnaires on how they perceive their environment, how they feel, and how they have 'experienced' their surroundings. This rich data will be ...

As chronic conditions are increasingly affecting our population, a number of researchers think that environmental conditions to which we are exposed to in our daily life contribute to this growing burden. Consequently, there is a need to develop valid and reliable measures of how people get exposed to these unhealthy places. Too often, research only considers the residential neighborhood as a location where environmental influences are experienced. There is a need to extend this notion and develop new computer tools for health studies and surveys that will provide valid and reliable information on the places people are exposed to. This information will be very useful in depicting a more precise picture of the environments we get exposed to which impact on our health. The measurement tools we will develop will be applied in the context of an important study on social health inequalities and cardiovascular health that currently follows 7300 individuals in the Paris Metropolitan area, France. By collecting detailed information on the places where people go to, we will be able to better estimate how residential and nonresidential environmental factors contribute to their health, and to the existence of social inequalities in health."

Research in geography has been trying to improve our consideration of both geographic space and time to understand people's options for mobility and related actual travel behaviour. By mapping the different locations people visit during a day to fulfill their activities, we hope to obtain a more precise measure of the types of food environments they get exposed to. These measures and related models will be used to assess whether the types of food stores we are exposed to in our daily living play a role in what we eat and on how much we weigh."
Documenting Urban Change for Health Research using Artificial Intelligence,"['Kestens, Yan']","['Brondeel, Ruben', 'Fuller, Daniel L', 'Stanley, Kevin G', 'Winters, Meghan']","['Built Environment', 'Deep Learning', 'Environmental Exposures', 'Google Street View', 'Machine Learning', 'Temporal Change']",20000.0,378438,"In order to better understand how urban form relates to health, it is important to obtain reliable measure of street characteristics, in particular those promoting healthy behaviors (e.g. active transport) and preventing traffic injuries, such as traffic calming measures. Virtual environmental audits with Google Street View images have proven valuable to document urban characteristics and urban change. Google Street view enables researchers (or crowdsourcing participants) to code various built environment characteristics online, instead of having to conduct direct observations in the streets. Moreover, Google Street View also provides historical images since 2007, enabling the detection of change in urban features over time. Coding the images manually is however very time-consuming and costly. 
Automatizing the virtual environmental audits has the potential of providing uniform measures over large geographical areas, or even globally. Previous studies have developed artificial intelligence algorithms to automatically detect objects (e.g. traffic signs) in Google Street View images. Using similar types of images, scientists have developed artificial intelligence methods to detect a range of street characteristics for example for self-driving cars or to help people with visual impairments in traffic situations (e.g. indication of street crossings). 
The aim of this proposal is to build a network of researchers in the fields of Artificial Intelligence, Public Health, and Urban Planning, and to plan a project on the use Google Street View images to detect changes in urban form characteristics.  The objectives of the project are to obtain adequate, reliable and cost-efficient measures of urban transformations that can then serve to health researchers interested in analyzing how urban change relates to health behavior, health, and health inequities. The codes used and data will be made available on open-source platforms for researchers to freely use in future projects."

We will also develop an online platform to deploy tools and methods within the 25 most populated cities in Canada. The built environment has been associated with various health behaviour including physical activity, social participation, and well-being. It is also related to air quality, noise and local food environments, which have been linked to various non-communicable diseases.

Although massive investments are made in urban infrastructure, even well-intentioned change may adversely affect vulnerable populations through gentrification processes. 
The goal of this research is to analyse how urban interventions, gentrification, and population health and health inequalities relate. Specifically, we aim to: 1) document if urban interventions (e.g., new bike lanes) aiming to improve quality of life tend to be located primarily in more deprived areas. 2) assess whether urban interventions lead to gentrification or vice versa, or if both processes are at play 3) measure the impact of urban interventions, neighbourhood gentrification, and experienced residential gentrification on physical activity, social participation and well-being, and 4) analyse differences in health outcome trajectories between low SES individuals who were displaced from gentrified neighbourhoods and those who could stay, and lastly 5) build a pilot simulation tool to help decision makers choose the best urban intervention scenario for health and equity. 
This study will build on an existing CIHR-funded team (INTERACT, 2016-2021), adding study participants to an existing cohort to specifically analyse effects of urban change on health and health inequalities while accounting for gentrification processes in Montreal. GIS and spatial analysis tools will be used to analyse retrospective and prospective dynamics of urban change, gentrification, and health. A battery of tools including online questionnaires, smartphone apps and dedicated sensors will provide detailed data about daily mobility, physical activity, and well-being.
Results will provide insights on how urban form changes impact population health outcomes and health inequalities, and support local and regional decision makers in designing and creating healthier communities."

Yet, transformative change requires stronger collaborations between urban decision-makers, scientific experts, and local communities. Scientific expertise (and knowledge learned from experience) is often underused when cities decide on policies and urban interventions, including those aiming to reduce inequities. The complex nature of urban equity planning projects, the amount, speed and diversity of data on behaviour and environments, and the need for collaborative processes ask for new toolsets to facilitate the linkages between academics, communities, and decision makers.
This proposal aims to better understand the contexts and tools needed to improve the use of science for informing urban decision-making for population health and equity. Specifically, we will 
Document ways to strengthen the science-policy interface to tackle urban health equity, through knowledge synthesis; 
Identify existing practical solutions and tools that facilitate the use of science in urban equity policy-making, through an environmental scan and key informant interviews; 
Collaboratively define a comprehensive roadmap to develop, test, and implement a toolset to accelerate the use of science in urban equity policy-making, through roadmapping workshops. 

Our work will result in a research brief and editorial (obj 1), a short guide on existing solutions and tools (obj 2) and a roadmap for developing a toolset supporting science to urban equity policy (obj 3).

The ""normative"" aging process is associated with higher disease burden, changing social roles, and more complex care needs. Individuals entering old age with a disability face additional difficulties including accessing regular health care, which can result in poor Continuity of Care (COC). COC is concerned with quality of care received over time and is strongly associated with health outcomes. This may be due, in part, to structural factors within and outside of the health care system (e.g., neighbourhood environment). However, this remains an understudied area and the limited evidence in this population precludes insight into how to support successful aging in this population.  The overall aim of this project is to examine how features of the social, physical and built environment influence successful aging outcomes and care continuity for those aging with disabilities. To address this research question, we will identify a cohort of individuals with disability from Medicare & Medicaid data (2002-2016), which is the federal health insurance program that provides free health care to those with disabilities. In addition, we will link contextual measures generated from several data sources, indicators of health outcomes and trajectories of care continuity over follow-up. With this research, we aim to identify the contextual facilitators for positive health and care outcomes in this population. Through identifying potential areas of intervention, results can inform public health and clinical policies and prevention efforts to support successful aging for those with disabilities."

One of the common indicators used to assess progress and challenges in population health include measuring the prevalence of diseases and risk factors across subpopulations. Population health strategies assume that relative differences in prevalence rates are a proxy for understanding disparities in disease risk. However, prevalence may be a flawed indicator since it aggregates disease risk into a single statistic, without accounting for synergistic effects (other risk behaviours), structural inequalities or cultural norms that can also influence disease burdens. This project will explore relative differences in prevalence rates between a minority and the general population to determine whether they correctly estimate true disparities in disease risk.
Tobacco use will be used as an exemplar due to its link to major chronic illnesses and data availability. About 18% of Canadians are current smokers. Subpopulation estimates reveal even greater concerns. For example, 59% of on-reserve First Nations, and 58% of Inuit are current smokers. The risk of developing a tobacco related illness depends on factors such as age at initiation of tobacco use, type or level of tobacco consumption, puffing behaviour and synergies with other risks (e.g alcohol use). These variables differ across subpopulations and may therefore produce disparities in disease risk that are different from disparities in tobacco use prevalence. By comparing the differences in tobacco use prevalence for aboriginal and non-aboriginal populations this project will 1) provide a framework for the critical evaluation of prevalence measures around tobacco use and related illnesses; 2) create a new lens to help explore health inequalities among minorities; and 3) inform strategies used to construct health landscapes and address differential disease burdens for obesity, cancer and heart disease."

Complex interactions between biological, social, cultural and environmental entities often determine health of individuals, locally and globally. These intricate health issues often required innovative solutions involving multiple stakeholders from different sectors. Understanding these complex interactions and identifying innovative interventions has become the key mandate of the Institute of Population and Public Health's (IPPH) strategic plan 2015-2018.

My broader research goal is to understand infectious disease epidemiology, interactions between pathogen, host and environment, and design efficient interventions to minimize public health issues. Which is very much aligned with IPPH's mandate and strategic research priorities 1 and 2 (coherent intersectoral action for population health improvements and scalable population health solutions).

One of my previous research projects included identifying zoonotic pathways for Nipah virus (NiV) transmission in humans in Bangladesh and testing efficient primary intervention. Drinking raw date palm sap was one of the risk factors for human NiV infection. Anthropological studies in the affected communities suggested that villagers from the outbreak sites saw fruit bats on date palm trees harvested for human sap consumption. However, the specific mechanism of NiV transmission from fruit bats to sap was not clear. My research documented the frequency and manner in which fruit bats accessed raw date palm sap at night (Khan et. al. 2010). Later years, we performed a randomized controlled trial to demonstrate the efficacy of primary interventions (locally made physical barriers on a date palm tree) that could prevent sap contamination by fruit bats (Khan et. al. 2012). 

The travel award would help me better understand CIHR grant application procedures and expand on my past experience of inter-disciplinary research in the current context to promote IPPH mandate."

In Canada, indoor air is frequently polluted by high levels of radioactive radon gas emanating from uranium rich bedrocks and accumulated inside the urban airtight energy efficient buildings and this is further deteriorating by the current pandemic restrictions. In 2019, about 40% of Canadian cancer-related deaths were from lung cancer, of which 1 in 5 occurred in never-smokers who suffer all the unjust stigmatization that smokers face. At the population level, radon inhalation is the second leading cause of lung cancer. People living in poorly ventilated urban houses are more at risk than those in rural areas. Historic radon prevention strategies have been based on the concept of volunteer testing and mitigation by individual investment that disproportionately affects distinct socioeconomic, gender and ethnic groups. In fact, Canadian radon maps built by the extrapolation of USA geologic data, created naive risk generalization that fuelled optimistic bias and resulted in missed opportunity for preventive actions. Unfortunately, radon-testing rates have remained at <6% despite >25 years of radon awareness campaigns and, thus, current strategy clearly has limited impact. Therefore, we must replace existing, ineffective prevention practices with innovative tailored actions to that are built on evidence gleaned from across disciplines. This study aims to examining a complex mix of built structural, environmental and human behavioural determinants by employing cutting edge AI analytics to predict and define the risk with highest precision.

This study will work with public health organizations across multiple provinces to develop strategies that will encourage better readiness for emergencies. We will use a pre-existing approach to develop engaging activities for public health organizations and improve their preparation for potential emergencies that could impact their communities. We will also explore whether these strategies will be relevant and useful in scaling broadly across Canada. This work is unique and has the potential to directly impact the lives of Canadians, as it aims to reduce the negative impacts that emergencies can have on health and well-being.

The long-standing COVID-19 pandemic represents a rare opportunity to investigate the enduring effects of a chronic stressor on pregnant women and their children. Indeed, 81% of pregnant women in Ontario report experiencing moderate to high levels of stress during the pandemic. The proposed research will provide an understanding of the pathways through which chronic prenatal stress alters child biopsychosocial development. This research is a continuation of a longitudinal study that followed 304 pregnant women (from Ontario), beginning in the early phase of the pandemic. Participants were followed throughout pregnancy and early into the postpartum period. The requested funds will support the continued assessment of these families at 18-, 24-, and 36- months postpartum. We will use various data collection methods (biological samples, observation, questionnaires) to examine three research questions: 1) Does prenatal stress affect the development of child stress systems and psychosocial development? 2) Do changes to child stress biology act as a mechanism linking prenatal stress to adverse psychosocial outcomes? and 3) Do certain prenatal and postnatal experiences put children at greater risk for adverse developmental outcomes? This work will outline child biological and psychosocial outcomes resulting from prenatal stress during the COVID-19 pandemic and determine who is in greatest need of support. Findings will inform the development of screening tools and targeted interventions, in order to facilitate recovery and prevent lifelong health implications. This research has the potential to impact the health and development of children and families, and has global health implications, as the effects of maternal stress on development, particularly in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, is a worldwide health concern."

Moreover, current climate change mitigation and adaptation plans often fail to consider their needs, potentially worsening their circumstances. The proposed project leverages a recently established network of thought leaders in Canada working to address health equity in the face of climate change. Focussing on women, children and youth, and older adults experiencing poverty, and attending to diversity within and across these groups, this project will (i) map key decision makers and experts who can speak to this topic, (ii) interview these individuals regarding risks and promising responses, (iii) identify data sources that can be used in the future to target responses, (iv) identify points in the complex system of climate change-health impacts that are leveraged with respect to public health interventions. These activities will occur alongside scoping literature reviews and participatory action projects that meaningfully engage lived experience. This project will deliver a response strategy that aligns with the priorities of the Public Health Action on Climate Change report. It will serve as a jumping-off point for an array of initiatives that can lead to a better understanding of the climate change impacts on the health of people experiencing poverty alongside feasible and leveraged possibilities for response. The work of this project team will be foundational as Canada prepares to face the daunting health crisis resulting from our changing climate."

This study uses nationally representative data from the United States (US) to explore whether one's immigrant status and acculturation to the US may influence the link between childhood experiences of abuse and being the victim or perpetrator of intimate partner violence in adulthood. Compared to US-born adults with US-born parents, foreign-born individuals were less likely to report a history of sexual and emotional abuse in their childhood, but were more likely to report physical neglect. Immigrant status was not associated with intimate partner violence perpetration or victimization in adulthood among respondents with or without a child maltreatment history. Among those without a child maltreatment history, foreign-born adults who were more acculturated to the US were more likely to report perpetrating intimate partner violence compared to US-born adults with US-born parents. Results tell us that immigrant status and acculturation are important factors to consider in family violence experiences."

Life satisfaction and physical health: Identifying underlying mediators and characterizing key moderators,"['Kim, Eric']","['Helliwell, John', 'Rosella, Laura C']","['Life Satisfaction', 'Psychological Well-Being']",455176.0,452215,"In Canada, life expectancy has stagnated, and years lost to disability have increased. Further, healthcare spending, which reached $264.4 billion in 2019, is projected to continue escalating. This is partly attributable to our rapidly rising older adult population; as people age, the prevalence and burden of chronic disease, and associated costs, increase. Thus, identifying factors that foster the maintenance of healthy ageing is of heightened importance for improving the health of our rapidly ageing society and containing healthcare costs. Most biomedical and public health efforts focus on reducing harmful risk factors. To date, this approach has had limited success in addressing the rising tide of unhealthy behaviours, chronic diseases, and healthcare costs. Thus, increasing attention has focused on identifying resilience factors that enhance people's ability to maintain health. Growing research shows that life satisfaction-a target of growing interest among citizens, policy-makers, and several prominent intergovernmental organizations (e.g., OECD, WHO, UN) alike-is consistently associated with reduced mortality risk. However, the underlying mechanisms of and the factors moderating this connection are unclear. The proposed research is relevant to public health because evaluating how life satisfaction is associated with a range of behavioural, biological, and stress-mitigating mechanisms will move the field forward by building the scientific case for a causal relationship between higher life satisfaction and enhanced health. This in turn will provide new directions for building a science of resilience, and providing new targets for preventive and therapeutic life satisfaction interventions and policies. Thus, the proposed research is relevant to CIHR's mission to create new scientific knowledge and enable its translation into improved health, more effective health services and products, and a strengthened Canadian health care system."

For example, private operators such as Bet MGM are now offering legal sports betting in Ontario. This has led to a significant increase in sports gambling advertisements across all media platforms. Unfortunately, sports gambling advertisements are associated with making more bets and spending more money on sports gambling. But, no study has examined this relationship over time. In other words, it is not known whether seeing sports gambling advertisements leads someone to gamble on sports and as a result, result in negative consequences because of their sports betting. The proposed study will examine whether seeing sports gambling advertisements leads to increased sports betting over a period of 6 months. We will recruit 1000 Ontarian adults who currently bet on sports who will complete 3 surveys over the period of 6 months. We will recruit a minimum of 30% of participants who self-identify as women as well as 30% of participants who self-identify as a racialized minority to increase representation in sports gambling research. Participants will be asked questions about how often and where they have seen sports gambling advertisements and the number of times and money spent gambling on sports to test whether sports gambling advertisements lead to increased sports betting and harms. We will also examine if participants with a higher risk of problem gambling, greater substance use and who are more impulsive are more likely to be influenced by sports gambling advertisements. If as predicted, sports gambling advertisements lead to increased sports betting and negative consequences, then the results of our research may help to inform the creation of a national advertising standard for sports gambling advertisements, similar to those that exist for alcohol, cannabis, and tobacco."
Benefits and Harms of Taking Opioids for Chronic Non-cancer Pain,"['Kim, Ja Ae (Shara)']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Benefit-Harm Analysis', 'Caregiver Perspective', 'Chronic Pain', 'Mixed Methods', 'Musculoskeletal Disease', 'Opioids', 'Patient Perspective']",4950.0,278051,"Chronic pain, defined as pain that persists for at least three to six months, has become an enormous societal burden that affects many people and can endure for many years. It is very important to manage chronic pain properly because this condition can impair an individual's ability to work, their quality of life and their ability to function. Musculoskeletal conditions are very prominent causes of chronic pain.
Opioids are effective treatments for acute moderate to severe pain, but have limited evidence of benefit for chronic pain. In addition, there are risks of harmful side effects such as constipation, vomiting, over-sedation and confusion. At a wider level, many patients are concerned about taking a medication that is commonly associated with addiction, crime and overdose. Since chronic pain is very common and all pain medications have limitations, opioid use has expanded dramatically in Canada over the past decade. Data from Ontario shows that opioid-related deaths have increased dramatically as well, making the need for research on the benefits and harms of opioids a priority.
In the proposed study, we will interview patients with chronic non-cancer pain and their caregivers, to gain an in-depth understanding of their experiences related to the patient's use of opioid medications - benefits, harms, nature of the painful condition, coping strategies, difficulties with usage, adherence, concerns regarding effect on family and friends, and overall weighing of positive and negative effects. We expect that caregivers may have a somewhat different perspective than patients on the overall weight of opioid benefit and harm. Although we expect some variation of opinion among the sample, it is likely that key themes will readily emerge. 
There has been surprisingly little research on the total patient experience with opioids and virtually none involving caregivers or situated in Canada. This study will add useful information for clinicians and for future studies."

Indigenous women are overrepresented among victims of violence and infectious diseases such as HIV. The few Indigenous-women-led interventions aimed to improve the wellness of Indigenous women through a wholistic cultural perspective have recognized that effective HIV-related programs and services should build on Indigenous women's strengths, embedding cultural knowledge and assets within program and service design and delivery. Additionally, Indigenous women have been voicing the need for culturally grounded and gender-based HIV programs and services. Primary healthcare research scholars have recommended culturally responsive approaches to care as a wise practice for Indigenous people experiencing health inequities. Culturally responsive approaches to care are strengths-based and spiritually grounded, and incorporate cultural safety, contextually- and community-tailored care, trauma- and violence-informed care, and harm reduction. The current research team will build upon this theoretical approach by incorporating Indigenous culture-based and gender-informed approaches. The research team is comprised of Indigenous women leaders in health and wellness along with non-Indigenous women, with some enlightened men, working together in solidarity. The aim of the project is to improve the wellness of Indigenous women living with HIV in SK and BC whose needs are not being met by multiple systems of care. Innovative and culturally grounded Indigenous approaches will be used to promote self-determining and wholistic health and wellness."

Traditionally, Indigenous women were the matriarchs, healers and care-takers of their communities. Now, however, Indigenous women are overrepresented among mental illness diagnoses, addictions and chronic diseases. In the Canadian context, urban Indigenous women are subject to high rates of poverty, violent victimization, gender and racial oppression, and discrimination when seeking health services. Colonization, enacted through diverse policies and tactics, was driven by the goal of separating Indigenous people from their land and culture, and resulted in isolation, marginalization and reduced coping mechanisms for Indigenous people.

Our CIHR-funded pilot study, Stamsh Slhanay Lhawat (SSL-I), investigated the benefits of land- and culture-based healing practices for wellness with 26 Indigenous women who reside in the inner-city of Vancouver, BC known as the downtown east side (DTES).  The women participated in our study, some self-assuredly and some with great apprehension, but all came bravely, with the hope of healing.  Findings revealed improved wellness and the necessity for sustained, low-barrier, trauma-informed, land- and culture-based healing activities that include the family to begin the healing process.

Building on success of SSL-I, the goal of this study is to support Indigenous women in the DTES with diverse lived and living experience achieve improved wellness. Land- and culture-based healing, reinforced by family involvement, will be privileged, with expressive therapies interwoven, where appropriate, for wholistic healing and wellness. A multi-disciplinary, Indigenous-led research team will work with community partners to create a ""two-worlds doing"" approach. Knowledge generated will inform the development of Indigenous, gender-specific wellness care system with urban Indigenous populations."

Inuit experience a disproportionate burden of disease due to existing colonial social and economic inequities between Inuit Nunangat and other regions of Canada. For example, Nunavik (one of the four Inuit regions) continues to experience high rates of bacterial STIs, specifically chlamydia and gonorrhea (rates are 9 and 73 times higher than those reported for the province of Quebec). With these rates, the future rise of syphilis and HIV is a source of constant concern.

In response to this, the Nunavik Board of Health and Social Services (NBHSS) launched the CheckUp project, a communication campaign using social marketing and social media to influence the social norms surrounding STBBI screening, aiming to normalize testing in Nunavik. The CheckUp project has emerged as an Inuit-specific promising practice focusing on the secondary prevention of STBBIs. This project has proven to effectively engage and empower Inuit youth in Nunavik by encouraging youth to practice their agency while engaging with the healthcare system.

The proposed research project aims to scale up and enhance the CheckUp project in Nunavik by shifting to a more wholistic approach to health promotion and contextualizing the project to ensure its relevance and success in other Inuit regions throughout Inuit Nunangat. The project will be extended into subsequent phases focusing on Inuit youth's views of wellness, health promotion and harm reduction approaches to create social media content, and community-based interventions that effectively promote healing. These will include arts- and land-based interventions and research approaches. The potential impact of this project is expected be profound in terms of decreasing the burden of STBBIs, increasing Inuit capacity in sexual health, and improving health and wellness outcomes for Inuit youth."

Canada is a country bifurcated by complex, multicultural and multilingual identities, and by colonial atrocities and neo-colonial policies and practices. Stories and language play a pivotal role in Indigenous peoples' abilities to maintain their sense of self, sovereignty and ways of knowing, being and doing.

The Kiskemisowin project seeks to address the loss of First Nations, Métis and Inuit languages, stories and knowledges by providing access and support to record the stories of Indigenous people in Saskatchewan, preserving them for future generations. Furthermore, to support Nation- and community-led revitalization efforts, much consideration must be given to the processes, consultation and digital asset management of this project.

Digital preservation, a critical component of this proposal, is complex, and when working with Indigenous Nations and communities. it is necessary to develop shared understandings between the research team and each community on how to best implement data sovereignty and access at the individual, community and public levels. We expect the communities will also all learn from each other, and all of us look forward to reciprocal community-to-community mentorship.

Ultimately, all the infrastructure and wise processes we develop with communities will support Indigenous wellness through individual autonomy, collective interests and creativity."

It is characterized by problems with coordination that causes children to have trouble with everyday activities including sports and play. Children with poor coordination have been repeatedly shown to be less physically active than other children. Because of this it is believed that children with DCD are less physically fit and therefore at an increased risk for becoming overweight,and developing health issues later in life. In order to truly help children with DCD we need to start studying children when they are young and learning how to be active. We plan to do a study that will test 300 children with DCD and 300 typically developing children aged 4 to 6. We will examine their motor skills, how much physcial activity they do, how fit they are, and how much they weigh. All these things will be measured every year for 5 years so we can see how they change or stay the same as the children grow. We will then be able to see how their motor skills change over time and how this impacts their overall health and activity levels."

The study will happen in three phases, starting with an online community survey to Métis Albertans. Phase two will analyze government health data to learn how many Métis people were vaccinated for HPV in the past. This information, in connection with the survey information, will help inform the final study. Phase three will use a Métis research method of keeoukaywin or 'visiting' with different Métis people in communities across Alberta, to try to understand the reasons people do, or do not, get vaccinated for HPV. All parts of the study will consider whether age, gender, sex, sexuality, disability, and Métis identity have an impact on vaccination and experiences of getting vaccinated. Throughout the process, Métis Nation of Alberta community members will help make decisions about how the study is conducted, how the data are analyzed and shared, and what is done with the information. We hope that through the process, community members become engaged and support HPV related cancer prevention activities for Métis Albertans.

Although major improvements have been made towards the treatment of certain symptoms associated with schizophrenia (e.g., hallucinations), other areas including cognition remain negatively impacted. Of particular importance in schizophrenia are memory impairments for every day, real life events. The study of real life, every day memory, however, has posed a major obstacle to researchers in that they have been unable to determine the veracity of patients' personal memories. Consequently, it is possible that researchers to date have been studying accounts of events that are only loosely based on reality. In the proposed study, we will assess memory for real life events in a virtual reality environment, in which we are able to control each aspect of the participants' experiences. Virtual reality has proven its usefulness in the treatment of anxiety disorders as well as in the investigation of spatial memory, and is well suited to studying memory for real life events.

Parmi les comportements de santé qui peuvent diminuer la concentration plasmatique du PCR, l'AP et la sédentarité jouent un rôle respectivement positif et négatif. Malgré les bénéfices associés à l'AP sur la diminution du taux de PCR, elles ne permettent pas de savoir si cet effet est indépendant ou non de la sédentarité. Nous proposons d'examiner l'association entre la dose d'activité physique quotidienne mesurée par accélérométrie et le niveau PCR chez les adultes canadiens en santé et touchés par l'arthrite et la fibromyalgie, deux maladies de type inflammatoire. Il s'agira de la première étude qui examine l'association entre activité physique mesurée objectivement et le taux de PCR chez des adultes sains et présentant des symptômes d'arthrite et de fibromyalgie dans la population canadienne. Au niveau clinique, nos résultats pourront offrir une aide aux cliniciens en rhumatologie à recommander une dose d'activité physique précise comme étant un «traitement» anti-inflammatoire accessible aux patients et savoir si la promotion de l'activité physique doit être couplée avec la lutte contre la sédentarité."
Improving support of substitute decision makers: Identification of decision-making needs and associated support tools for caregivers of people living with dementia,"['King, Seema']",['N/A'],"['Advance Care Planning', 'Caregivers', 'Dementia', 'Gerontology', 'Palliative Care', 'Substitute Decision Making']",,460601,"Approximately 9 seniors get diagnosed with dementia every hour in Canada and more than 419,000 Canadians over 65 years are living with dementia. This means that many friends and family take on the role as substitute decision maker, making decisions for those who have lost capacity. Research shows that when caregivers are not prepared for this responsibility, they are at risk of distress and anxiety that can last for months to years. Although, there are resources to support adults in planning ahead and communicating their wishes, we still lack tools to help caregivers navigate the legal, emotional, and medical realities of making decisions for others. Caregivers, community groups and provincial health services in Alberta have requested better resources and strategies for caregivers of people living with dementia. The aim of this study is to find ways to improve caregivers' decision-making experiences. First, I will listen to caregivers and map out their stories of making decisions for a person living with dementia, and the supports they used or wished they had. From these experiences I will create a map to understand the journey of decision-making. Next, I will take a list of supportive resources, including booklets, videos, on-line tools that have already been tested but may not be in common use and match them to the decisions that caregivers make. This will help us to see 1) when existing resources could be most usefully deployed 2) what themes and decisions have no current supports. I will take the finished map and related resources to caregivers, healthcare providers, community organizations and other researchers and brainstorm how to implement improved access to and easy use of support tools for caregivers.
Through partnerships with provincial and national organizations the knowledge created through this project can make change across Canada. Ultimately, we will lessen the distress of Canadians when making decisions for others."
"QF2011: The effects of the Queensland Flood on pregnant women, their pregnancies, and their children's early development.","['King, Suzanne', 'Austin, Marie-Paule', 'Kildea, Sue']","['Brunet, Alain F', 'Hurrion, Elizabeth M', 'Laplante, David P', 'McDermott, Brett M', 'McIntyre, Harold D', 'Schmitz, Norbert', 'Stapleton, Helen', 'Vaillancourt, Cathy']","['Behavioral Assessment', 'Biological Mechanisms', 'Birth Outcomes', 'Disaster Research', 'Early Childhood Development', 'Longitudinal Design', 'Prenatal Stress', 'Psychometric Assessment']",1788770.0,226760,"Research suggests that maternal exposure to a severe stressor increases her baby's risk for a variety of disorders in adulthood. Animal research has demonstrated that maternal stress hormones pass through the fetus' placenta and affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and immune system, which are them associated with later problems. Relatively few studies have been able to study this relationship in humans because it is unethical to stress pregnant women. Project Ice Storm was the first such study to look at how stress arising from a natural disaster affected exposed fetuses and has shown that high levels of maternal stress have lasting effects on cognitive, behavioral, and physical development. However, Project Ice Storm was unable to determine the mechanisms by which maternal stress affects the developing fetus. The aim of The QF2011 Study is to replicate Project Ice Storm while increasing understanding of the biological mechanisms responsible for the effects of maternal stress during pregnancy. We will determine the extent to which the effects of various components of exposure to a disaster on the mother, her pregnancy, and the fetus, are moderated by biological and psychosocial factors, and by two different models of midwifery practice. We are taking advantage of a unique situation: In January, large regions of the state of Queensland experienced the worst floods in 50 years. This happened after researchers at Brisbane's Mater Mothers' Hospital had collected data on maternal depression and psychosocial factors in more than 300 pregnant women for a study comparing midwifery practices. The proposed collection of maternal and fetal blood, placenta, maternal and child cortisol samples, as well as conducting in-depth assessment of the mothers and their children when the children are 1, 2.5, and 4 years of age will enable us to determine the mechanisms by which maternal stress during pregnancy can affect their child's behavior after birth."

The peak age at onset of psychiatric disorders is 14 years. Prospective, longitudinal studies are needed to understand how PNMS contributes to problems in adolescence. However, since researchers cannot stress pregnant women, most studies rely on non- randomly distributed maternal anxiety or life events during pregnancy. Without randomization, the effects of the objective exposure and subsequent subjective reaction to an event cannot be separated. Project Ice Storm is the world's largest prospective study of PNMS from a natural disaster. Data on pregnant women's objective exposure and subjective reactions to the 1998 Quebec ice storm was collected, and their children have been assessed regularly since the age of 6 months. Longitudinal analyses show that, the higher objective and subjective PNMS levels are associated with more childhood behavioural problems, and poorer cognitive, motor, and physical outcomes through the age of 11½ years, and perhaps beyond. The goal of this renewal is to determine the extent to which PNMS continues to explain individual differences in the children's development in adolescence, and to determine how the hormonal changes of puberty might influence this development. Children will be seen and assessed at the ages of 13½, and mothers will complete ratings of their children at these same times. This unique study will allow us to determine the extent to which PNMS influences problems that emerge during adolescence. Our data will show how PNMS predicts long-term trajectories of cognitive, behavioural and physical development. This knowledge will aid us in developing recommendations for limiting harm to the foetus following stress in pregnancy."

One of the challenges is access to HAART by those living in rural areas located at a distance from existing hospital-based program.   The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term sustainability of a community based antiretroviral treatment (CBART) program that was established by our research team in western Uganda in 2005 in order to provide access to HAART to the rural population in this area.  We will undertake a process to effectively hand over the program to the local health care system and community and evaluate their ability to sustain the activities and treatment outcomes of this program.  If our community-based approach to HAART delivery can be maintained successfully over a two-year period by the local stakeholders this model could be confidently recommended for replication in Uganda and elsewhere in Africa as truly viable and locally sustainable with desirable outcomes."

Combining addiction care (methadone maintenance therapy, or MMT) and HIV care (highly active antiretroviral therapy, or HAART) in a community setting has the potential to improve short and long term outcomes for this population.  However, key community members have identified that there remain considerable challenges to consistently taking medications and remaining on treatment (MMT and HAART) due a number of other factors, such as: a lack of stable housing, coexisting mental health problems, and experiences of stigma and discrimination when attempting to access health care services. The purpose of the research is to obtain better understanding of what factors contribute to IDUs who are living with HIV/AIDS not taking their medications regularly and staying on treatment (MMT and HAART), and also what supports have contributed to successfully taking medications and staying on treatment. 

We will start by looking at what other research can tell us about the best ways to improve the treatment and health outcomes of IDUs who are living with HIV/AIDS. We will be interviewing up to 12 male and female formal current and former clients of Direction 180 and Mainline who have experience with both treatments, MMT and HAART. We will also speak with up to 8 service providers who work directly with these individuals. By speaking with these groups, we will get a better idea of their daily experiences living with (and providing services for) addiction and HIV/AIDS and also obtain an understanding of the things that contribute to being able to take medications regularly and stay on treatment or not. Results of this study will be used to develop a larger study involving community-based organizations and researchers to address treatment models and policies across communities in Atlantic Canada."

Since people in different countries are exposed to different policies, comparing food intake between countries can help build evidence on the influence of policies on diet. We will compare food and beverage consumption of Canadian and U.S. adults and children, using data from both countries collected in similar ways. We will look at consumption of food groups and nutrients that are important to public health and estimate the proportion of the populations that meet recommendations for healthy eating. We will also look at the key sources of food groups, nutrients and other dietary components such as added sugars (e.g., soda and fruit drinks). These dietary analyses will be paired with a detailed look at policies relevant to the food environment in each country. These include initiatives related to the prices of foods, nutrition labelling on foods and in restaurants, and foods permitted to be sold and served in schools. We will explore whether differences in food consumption between the two countries may be driven by variations in policies. In our prior work, we compared nutrient adequacy among individuals living in households affected by insecure food access. We found that those in Canada were more likely to have inadequate calcium intakes compared to those in the U.S. Interestingly, milk prices have been found to be higher in Canada, with implications for access among families struggling with financial constraints. This type of insight can inform future research to evaluate interventions related to pricing and other aspects of the food environment. Overall, this work will provide a rich look into the eating patterns of Canadians while also shedding light on policy approaches to improve nutrition among the population, including among subgroups who may have poorer diet than other groups due to factors like low income."

Recent literature, including studies conducted by members of this team, suggests a need to better understand policy implementation. In 2006, Nova Scotia (NS) became one of the first provinces in Canada to launch a food and nutrition policy (FNP) to provide standards for foods and beverages served and sold in schools. As part of a provincial chronic disease strategy, a revised FNP will be released in 2015, offering a timely opportunity to evaluate its implementation and the change in school food environments. With a baseline assessment of the original FNP underway and the implementation of the revised FNP forming a new population health intervention, our research seeks to undertake a system-level evaluation of the revised FNP. First, we will describe system-level policy dissemination and determine the internal and external capacity that supports/prevents policy implementation in schools through consultations with internal stakeholders, a document review and follow-up key-informant interviews. Second, we will assess the school-level factors that influence adoption of the FNP through school case studies (including a document review, interviews and observations) and a photovoice project to elicit youth voice. Finally, we will measure changes in school food environments with comparison to our baseline data collection in progress with an online survey and an audit of the school food environment to assess nutrition practices ant the costs of implementation. Findings from this work will allow us to understand the complex school system factors required for effective policy implementation to increase the potential for impact on children's nutrition, health and health equity."

The purpose of this planning and dissemination grant is to support diverse children and youth within Nova Scotia to reflect on, and act upon, the One Chance report recommendations. Our objectives are to: 1) Engage children and youth in conversations that can advance the six recommendations of the One Chance report, and 2) Support children and youth to plan a youth-led forum with decision-makers to identify key policy actions that can move the One Chance recommendations forward. We will use a Youth Participatory Action Research (YPAR) approach to engage young people in this work. For objective 1, ten children and youth from diverse backgrounds will be invited to participate in a Youth Leadership Team (YLT). Once the YLT is formed, we will convene a 1-day sense-making workshop, facilitated by the project team. At this workshop, the YLT will learn about the findings of the One Chance report. For objective 2, the YLT will plan and deliver a 3-hour youth-led forum, aimed at engaging decision-makers in priority-setting based on identified actions for the six recommendations from the report. The forum will be open to decision-makers from government and youth-serving organisations. During the forum, the YLT and decision-makers will be invited to develop a shared action plan for moving the One Chance recommendations forward. By engaging young people in critical reflection, visioning and planning around the One Chance report recommendations, and engaging decision-makers in conversations about what actions are feasible to advance the report recommendations, we will close the knowledge-to-action gap to improve child and youth well-being."

The lung cancer five-year survival rate is among the lowest of the leading cancer sites; it is 18% overall and only 4% when the disease has already spread to distant sites. Lung cancer is very rarely diagnosed at an early stage because the disease presents with few symptoms; non-smokers, in particular, are much more likely be diagnosed at a later stage since physicians are not usually looking for it in non-smokers. This is a large study population and includes a large number of both smokers and non-smokers.
We will study the link between several suspected risk factors for lung cancer and cancer risk among participants in the various cohorts that comprise the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow Project. We will assess the risk of cancer according to 1) residential radon, 2) outdoor air pollution, and 3) fruit and vegetable intake.

Research Questions: 
((1) In what ways does the house impact COVID-19? 
(2) In what ways does the house impact the management of COVID-19?
(3) Explore SLFN's response to COVID-19 isolation and vaccines.
Methods:  This research builds on a decade long health research relationship between SLFN and researchers.  This team recently completed a co-created research process in which the findings revealed significant relationships between the house and respiratory health on SLFN. House factors were important to health outcomes. Having visible mold and a smell of mold in the house was correlated with both treatment and hospitalization for most respiratory health outcomes. Given that the house is important to respiratory health outcomes understanding the role of the house in COVID-19 in SLFN is an important question of the community. Sturgeon Lake Health Centre has collated data on all CoVID-19 cases in their community including close contact tracing and transmission, and residence for each case.   This project will assess if the same houses that are impacted by house factors in our respiratory health survey are more impacted by CoVID-19? These findings will be built on with qualitative methods to further understand how the house impacts isolation and vaccine.  The  findings will be returned to the community, in ways that are meaningful to the community.  Discussions of the findings and strategies for ways and means forward will be co-created with the community,  While the results will be beneficial to SLFN policy and processes, the knowledge gained will likely resonate with other First Nation communities so that they are able to co-create similar programs based on their strengths and response to COVID-19.  Outcome: Understand and build a strong effective community response to COVID-19."

With DAAs came the opportunity to address one of the most significant causes of illness and death in people living with HIV. Curing HCV in all people with HIV coinfection could prevent an epidemic of liver disease and cancer, reduce associated conditions such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and improve overall health and well-being. While the end of HCV has been heralded, in reality, realising the potential of DAAs has faced numerous challenges. Treatment access is uneven and people with vulnerabilities (e.g., substance use, mental illness, poverty, stigma) may not be able to consistently remain engaged in care or complete treatment- key steps to ensuring durable cure and maximizing potential health benefits of DAAs. As treatment expands to people who have ongoing infection risks, re-infections may increase. HIV, its therapies, and associated health issues such as fatty liver disease, may worsen liver disease and prevent liver scaring from improving. The epidemic of opioid misuse and overdose means many people may die even though cured.

Over the last 15 years, the Canadian Coinfection Cohort has enrolled over 2000 people living with HIV-HCV, drawn from all affected populations across Canada. Our multidisciplinary team, rigorous methods, extensive national and international partnerships and community engagement ensure we will effectively address the key remaining questions: How can we identify and re-engage those who remain to be treated and cured? Who needs to be monitored for re-infection post-cure and with what frequency? Do all co-infected people have improved liver damage and fewer liver complications after cure? How can we maximize the longterm health benefits of DAAs?

The sun is a major source of vitamin D and levels can vary over the seasons.  They also vary in people from different ethnic backgrounds.  Genetic and other factors can also contribute to the amount of vitamin D and we do not completely understand what factors are the most important.  We plan to recruit volunteers aged 18 to 59 from different ethnic groups in the Toronto area and ask them to provide a DNA sample and to complete a diary about factors that might contribute to vitamin D levels every two months over the year.  We have already had 53 people participate in a pilot study.  A blood sample will be taken each time to measure blood indicators of vitamin D.    We can use this information to develop better ways of assessing vitamin D in large population studies to study vitamin D and health and to create better public health messages and clinical trials."

About 2500 women have participated so far. We recently have also begun studying children whose mothers participated. We ask the mothers about cannabis use just before and during the pregnancy and we also ask about smoking or vaping by the mother or others in the household when we follow-up on the children.  We study the development of the children when they are 24 months and 4 years old. This gives us an opportunity to study the relationship between child exposure to cannabis and child development. We also collect information on many factors that might be related to cannabis use.
     We plan to use this funding opportunity to do some initial analysis of our data and extend the number of children with follow-up information so that we can plan a larger study to look at modern cannabis use around the time of legalization before, during, and after pregnancy and child brain development. We will determine whether the proportion of women using cannabis before and during pregnancy changes with legalization and what factors are associated with use. We will do some preliminary analysis of whether cannabis use is associated with birth weight and size for gestational age. We will also extend our child follow-up to get estimates of the proportion of children who are exposed to cannabis smoke or vapour during early childhood and do preliminary assessments of cannabis use at various times and child development. The information we get will be very important in developing a larger study to look at how changing cannabis use might affect children over the long term."

For example, ethical concerns related to the scaling up of TasP include the potential for increased HIV-related stigma among targeted populations, potentially coercive seek, test and treat strategies in efforts to identify new and early infections, as well as challenges to ensuring long-term adherence to ART among socially vulnerable populations. Using techniques associated with implementation science and theoretical frameworks from the social sciences (e.g., risk environment theory), the proposed study will capture and track the experiences and ethical dimensions of TasP implementation among vulnerable populations within two contexts: Vancouver, Canada and Paris, France. The findings from the proposed work will support ongoing efforts to better anticipate (and pre-emptively address) the features of implementation context and TasP programs that might hamper effective and ethical scale-up.
The proposed post-doctoral fellowship will provide training and support to develop an international comparative study that investigates the extent to which contextual features of health systems effectively manage the ethical and implementation concerns of TasP. Specifically, the objectives are to: 

(1) collect and analyze interview accounts from vulnerable populations currently being targeted for TasP regarding their experiences with TasP; 

(2) collect and analyze interview accounts of policy and decision makers in order to characterize how various ethical and implementation considerations related to vulnerable populations are taken up or rejected; and 

(3) explore and describe how these issues might vary within and across study settings over time."

Understanding the processes by which the OSHSP can create new opportunities to meaningfully engage men in accessing STI/HIV testing services is therefore the fundamental aim of the proposed study. The findings from the proposed study will provide recommendations for tailoring the OSHSP to meet the needs of young men in BC to improve young men's sexual health services. This study will: (1) Examine young men's perspectives on the saliency, credibility and value of the emerging OSHSP; (2) Describe and examine how men are represented (e.g., gender norms; sexuality) within the OSHSP; (3) Use these perspectives to facilitate the development of recommendations for tailoring the OSHSP to accommodate the needs of young men; (4) Explore the differential effects of the OSHSP across potentially vulnerable subgroups of men and use this information to respond to their needs. The study will use a purposive sampling strategy to recruit participants (men ages 15-24) from a variety of socio-cultural backgrounds to ensure a wide variety of perspectives. There will be a particular emphasis recruiting young men who may be most vulnerable to the health and social impacts of STIs/HIV (e.g., economically disadvantaged; men who have sex with men). A variety of qualitative data collection techniques will be used, including: in-depth, qualitative interviews (n=40); focus groups (4 groups with n=5 men); and a one-day Participatory Planning Summit (n=12 men)."

Whereas previous classes of therapeutics required up to a one-year treatment regimen that was associated with highly adverse side effects and a limited cure rate (40-50%), newly available DAA medications include regimens as short as 8 weeks and have far less side effects and significantly higher cure rates (90-95%). Nonetheless, little is known about how the introduction of DAA treatment shapes the short- and long-term health outcomes and experiences of those co-infected with HIV/HCV. This knowledge gap is particularly salient for HIV-positive People Who Inject Drugs (PWID) and Men who have Sex with Men (MSM) - two populations with historically high rates of HIV/HCV co-infection globally and who also experience a variety of social and structural barriers to HIV/HCV care. 

The proposed planning activities will aim to catalyze a new program of Canada-France-Brazil comparative research regarding the evolving HCV/HIV cascades of care for co-infected PWID and MSM in a post-DAA era. The objectives are to:

1) Conduct a scoping study to identify how implementation context influences the effectiveness of DAA interventions among HIV-positive PWID and MSM. 
2) Host a workshop with knowledge users, community stakeholders and research scientists in Vancouver, Marseille and Rio de Janeiro.
3) Develop and submit a research funding proposal.

By investigating the implementation dimensions of rapidly evolving HIV/HCV treatment opportunities, our proposed research planning and research activities will bring into sharper focus the pooled effects of how features of implementation context, health care delivery systems and individual behaviour impact the outcomes of on-going and future DAA interventions within and across a variety of global settings operating at variegated 'stages' of implementation and scale up."

To be effective, efforts to ""scale up"" TasP must also be informed by information pertaining to the social and economic realities of the implementation contexts. Some have suggested that the scale-up of TasP across several country settings provides 'natural experiments' that may yield insights regarding the ways in which this large-scale intervention interacts with particular contexts to produce potentially heterogeneous implementation experiences and outcomes.  

Drawing on data gathered through a multi-site, four-year longitudinal study, the presentation will describe the heterogeneous experiences of TasP scale-up in: Vancouver (Canada); Paris (France); and Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Data were gathered using techniques associated with Implementation Science and guided by theoretical frameworks from the social sciences (e.g., risk environment theory) and population health ethics (e.g., social justice).

The presentation will highlight the emergent findings, including heterogeneous effects on: HIV-related stigma; non-biomedical forms of HIV prevention; and anticipated scale-up coverage. Several features of each implementation context (e.g., socio-cultural, economic and legal contexts) and TasP programming approaches are identified and discussed in terms of their capacity to facilitate or impede effective and ethical scale-up of TasP among heterogeneous populations of people living with HIV. This presentation concludes by underlining a set of policy implications, including those within and outside of the health sector that may provide more equitable experiences and outcomes related to TasP within and across heterogeneous populations and contexts."

In both Canada and France, high rates of HIV incident infections persist among core groups of substance-using MSM, whereas other populations have experienced significant declines in HIV and other sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBIs) in recent years. Recent research attributes these inequities to a combination of high-risk sexual behaviour (e.g., unprotected anal intercourse) and substance use, including the use of stimulants (e.g. methamphetamine) and depressants (e.g., GHB). While new and emerging substance use treatment and prevention interventions hold great promise, it remains unclear how to effectively implement or adapt mainstream substance use treatment and prevention interventions to effectively address drug- and sexual-related harms that arise among MSM. To address these knowledge gaps, the proposed research planning grant will bring together a new team of investigators - including a mix of junior and senior researchers and trainees, knowledge users and community partners - to catalyze a program of research that will generate context-sensitive and population-specific evidence to inform substance use treatment and prevention interventions to reduce drug- and sexual-related harm among MSM. By establishing an international Canada-France collaboration, we will bring into sharper focus the pooled effects of how features of implementation context (e.g., pharmacological regulations; socio-cultural norms), health care delivery systems and individual behaviour impact the outcomes of on-going and future substance use treatment and prevention interventions where they have been implemented at different stages and with differential effects."

As we move into the recovery and renewal phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, ongoing social, economic, and cultural changes are likely to impact the health and social trajectories of adolescents, underscoring the urgency for health, social and economic systems to keep pace with these changes. Our aim is to provide time-sensitive understandings about adolescent health and social well-being during and following the next phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we plan to strike a FOCUS on Adolescents Youth Advisory Committee (YAC) to co-lead adaptations to our existing FOCUS research infrastructure in Canada and France that currently only has the capacity to focus on young adults (i.e., those over the age of majority). Alongside the YAC, we will identify strategies to identify the adaptations that need to occur within our broader program of FOCUS research, including age-based and country-specific adaptations to involve adolescents ages 15-19 in a series of annual interviews (n=20 per country) and biannual cross-sectional national online surveys (n=3,500 per country per wave, including ~1,000 between the ages 15-19). Towards the end of our study, using a community-based approach to mixed-methods synthesis, we will also host one Participatory Planning Summit in both Canada and France with knowledge users (e.g., clinicians, decision-makers) and other stakeholders (e.g., YAC members, adolescent youth organizations) to identify strategies to improve adolescent health as we move into the next phases of the COVID-19 pandemic."

Our Youth Advisory Committee co-organized and -facilitated the January 2020 Summit leading to the development of the current proposal. Ultimately, participants from the Summit identified that knowledge gaps in this area have severely limited our capacity to design, implement and evaluate interventions that are culturally safe for diverse genders, sexual identities and for youth who are racialized and exposed to living on the streets. The current proposal aims to fill these gaps.

To do so, we will launch a three-year community-based qualitative study. Through longitudinal interviews, we will document the evolving experiences of approximately 30 young people. We will also conduct ethnographic fieldwork activities in a number of treatment and care settings frequented by youth who use CM/ATS to further our understanding of youths' experiences in and across these settings over the study period. We will also conduct interviews with 10 stakeholders each year. Finally, we will host additional annual Side by Side Summits to advance dialogue on study findings and inform promising approaches to intervention.

Past research studies have found that mothers who are pregnant during intense wildfires may give birth to babies who are smaller or born prematurely. The goal of our study is to better understand the risks of wildfire exposure during pregnancy on child development and health. The province of British Columbia provides a valuable opportunity to understand how wildfire exposure during pregnancy may affect child health. This is because the intensity of wildfires has varied over time and over regions of the province. We will use this ""natural experiment"" by comparing children who experienced varying amounts of wildfire exposure during pregnancy. We will determine if wildfire exposure
during pregnancy is related to child health and developmental outcomes using population based data, such as Medical Services Plan billings. In a group of children, we will also determine the relationship with biological markers at birth. This will include marks on DNA that can affect the activity of our genes, as well as markers of inflammation. Identifying biological markers could help us determine how wildfire exposure during pregnancy shapes child development and health. It could also help us identify babies at risk of long-term negative
effects. Based on the findings, we will prepare materials for the general public and healthcare professionals. Our hope is to help protect pregnant women and their babies during future wildfire seasons."

Within the Canadian context, we know much about the health outcomes and the employment patterns of immigrants, but less about the impact of work on health, in particular on work disability experiences and the longer term health consequences of work disability. Emerging evidence suggests that immigrants to Canada have different experiences to Canadian-born workers.  Longer disability durations for immigrant workers may be attributed to more severe work injuries in higher risk jobs; and to barriers navigating health care, employer and insurance benefits systems for optimal return to work outcomes. Evidence also suggests important differences in work disability experiences for women and young workers immigrating to Canada. Using a unique research opportunity that will merge immigration data with workers' compensation and medical services data for the working population of British Columbia, the purpose of this study is to describe differences in work disability experiences, along the continuum from injury to rehabilitation to return-to-work and to longer term health outcomes, among immigrant workers compared to Canadian-born workers. Evidence of different experiences and of determinants of these differences, are necessary inputs for discussions and ultimately decisions by policy makers, employers and regulators/insurers to reduce barriers and health inequities, and improve return-to-work outcomes for all workers, including immigrants."

In the other hand, the organization of services, and also social forces and inequalities can impact the use of services and patient outcomes. Differences in population characteristics and challenges faced by health systems contribute to disparities in health, highlighting the importance to understand the factors associated with use of services, access to care or performance of organizations. Assessing accurately these factors is key for designing and implementing successful solutions to reduce disparities and achieve positive health outcomes and equity in health. 
An area of focus is the prevalence, quality indicators, and health outcomes related to chronic diseases and multimorbidity. The burden of multimorbidity has been highlighted in all population groups beside older people. My goal is to further explore issues pertaining to the use of services among complex multimorbid patients and special populations, to improve health outcomes and reduce inequalities. 
Specifically, my proposed program will analyze care coordination and inequities related to multimorbidty. A first project will study how providers collaborate to improve health system integration for these complex patients. The goal is to support patients navigate efficiently the healthcare systems, by identifying successes and missed opportunities in care management, and by measuring patient experience and care outcomes. Secondly, it is key to identify inequalities faced by people with chronic conditions, namely underprivileged population such as indigenous communities. This project aims to measure and understand depression in the context of multimorbidity. Because of cultural differences, risk of stigmatization, misinterpretations, and also lack of data, appropriately measuring and acknowledging depression is a crucial step to face the problem and identify successful solutions to reduce gaps."

Our goal is to understand current practices around support of sexual expression of persons living dementia in urban and rural long-term care homes, and to develop and evaluate a digital arts-informed toolkit. This is an integrated knowledge translation study that will consist of two-phases of qualitative research. Phase I is a study of two long-term care homes, one in urban Ontario and the other in rural Alberta. In this phase we will use demographic questionnaires, observations, interviews, and document analysis. Observations will be of interactions between providers, persons living with dementia, family members. Interviews will be conducted with persons living with dementia (10/site), family members of persons living with dementia (20/site); care providers (25/site); managers (5/site); and professional consultants (5/site). Phase II is the development and evaluation of a digital arts-informed toolkit. The evaluation will be done using focus group discussions with all family members, care providers, managers, and consultants from Phase I.

This study will advance understanding of challenges to supporting sexual expression of persons living with dementia in urban and rural long-term care homes. It will also identify examples of promising practices in this area. Our toolkit will help individuals and organizations to support sexual expression for persons living with dementia in these settings."

Previous research has shown that seniors who considered their families to be healthy were less likely to be at risk for developing a problem with gambling.  On the other side of the coin, people with a history of depression, anxiety, and family problems were more likely to be at risk for gambling problems.  In this study, we will look at factors that may help to preserve and promote family mental health in relation to gambling behaviour.  These factors include current mental health, family relationships, gender, ethnicity, and religious belief.  Our population of interest is the Baby Boomer generation, because they can give details about the family they came from and the family they created, that is, their relationships with their parents and their (now-adult) children.  With this information, not only will we be able to find which factors are best able to promote the mental health of families, but we can also gather valuable information about whether the family life of the aging Baby Boomer generation differs from that of their parents in any significant ways.  
     One of the factors of interest is ethnicity.  We will be studying three ethnic groups, Anglophones, Francophones, and Métis, in the province of Ontario.  These groups have different family challenges, different gender expectations, and sometimes different religious beliefs.  Comparing these groups will help us to understand, for example, whether certain family dynamics work for one group but not another, or whether gambling means something different to the different groups.  By comparing ethnic groups we can avoid making false generalizations and learn about the specific family needs of these groups.
     From this study, we hope to be able to determine which factors can best promote family mental health in these three populations and help to prevent gambling problems and other mental health issues before they start."

When we combine it with information about their cancer screening visits, say, mammogram dates, then we get a improved view of these health patterns. These patterns will be found using advanced methods that can combine many types of information in reliable ways. The important factors will be tested using mock data that mimics the ATP data. This will identify the best ones to catch cancer early so that they can be targeted by the cancer screening and prevention programs.

     The health patterns we discover will be studied in a similar group of adults in the B.C. Generations Project, so that we are confident of our findings. This B.C. study started a few years after the ATP one but has collected similar information on adults who did not have cancer when they enrolled in the study. The confirmed health patterns will then be used to improve cancer surveillance knowledge and activities in Alberta and beyond to find cancer earlier. 

     The study team includes cancer prevention researchers, cancer surveillance and screening directors in Alberta as well as leaders of groups who will put the results into action."

In our large sample of children and families with and without pre-COVID mental health and neurodevelopmental problems, we have previously shown that the majority of children experienced a significant negative impact to their MH during the pandemic. However, up to 30% of children reported no MH concerns, or even improvement of their MH during school and recreation closures. From self- and parent-online report of MH symptoms, and using the infrastructure that we have successfully established, we will now determine whether these MH impacts are long-lasting. This study will examine the roles of sociodemographic factors (e.g. household income, race/ethnicity), COVID-19 factors (e.g. vaccination status), child and family-level factors to understand what places a child at increased or decreased risk of MH problems during societal re-opening. Lastly, we want to understand whether children whose MH initially improved, during societal closures, experience increased MH problems as society re-opens. The results of this study are essential for identifying children at risk for poor MH and improving their outcomes. Our experienced team and established partnerships will ensure that study data are used to advocate for children's needs and to inform public health decisions about the societal re-opening process over the coming year and into a post-pandemic period."
"Preventing cardiovascular disease: lifestyle modification, drug intervention, or genetic determination?","['KOSCHINSKY, Marlys L']","['Boffa, Michael B']","['Cafe Scientifique', 'Cardiovascular Disease', 'Diabetes', 'Drug Therapy', 'Genetic Risk', 'Lifestyle Modification', 'Myocardial Infarction', 'Nutrition', 'Panel Discussion', 'Stroke']",3000.0,263602,"Cardiovascular diseases including heart attacks and strokes are one of the major causes of death in Canada. Almost 30% of all deaths can be attributed to cardiovascular diseases and the cost of these disorders in terms of lost wages and productivity and medical costs is over $20 billion. Every 7 minutes, a Canadian dies from heart attack or stroke. Virtually every Canadian will have known a family member or friend who has suffered from cardiovascular disease. As such, there is tremendous interest amongst the general public about cardiovascular diseases and their prevention and treatment.

There is a complication, however, that greatly affects the ability of the general public to use and understand the latest evidence-based medical advice on the topic. This complication is the remarkable complexity of cardiovascular disease. 

The goal of our proposed Cafe Scientifique is to simplify this complexity by breaking down risks for cardiovascular disease into genetic factors, lifestyle choices, and preventative therapies. Our Cafe may touch on a variety of topics related to reducing risk of cardiovascular disease, such as the nature of scientific investigation and health statistics, the ethical issues surrounding preventative interventions, the importance of scientific literacy in the public health sphere, and the role of the physician-patient relationship. All of these topics are ones that researchers, health care professionals, and the general public alike are invested in and have opinions on. We anticipate a very lively discussion of these issues and we believe that this event will be very informative and thought-provoking for the attendees."
The effects of removing primary school tuition fees on markers of fertility: An evaluation of policy change in 18 African countries,"['Koski, Alissa']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,324508,"Education has long been associated with women's reproductive behavior. Women with more schooling are consistently observed to marry at a later age and have fewer, yet healthier, children. Many African countries eliminated primary school tuition fees in the 1990s in an effort to make education more accessible, particularly for girls. Dramatic increases in enrollment followed fee removal. In sub-Saharan Africa where fertility rates are high, increased access to schooling has the potential to significantly improve population health. The impact of tuition fee removal on predictors of fertility has not been evaluated. 

We used data collected from nationally representative household surveys in 18 African countries to estimate trends in the average age at sexual debut, first marriage, and first birth among women born between 1950 and 1996. These data were combined with information on the timing of tuition fees removal in each country. We estimated the effect of removing tuition fees on the average age at sexual debut, first marriage, and first birth using an analytic approach that compared women who went to primary school under tuition-free policies to those who did not. 

The average age at sexual debut, first marriage, and first birth changed very little over our 46-year study period. We found no evidence that removing tuition fees significantly delayed the timing of these events. 

Our findings indicate that enacting tuition-elimination policies did not have an effect on important predictors of fertility. Ineffective policies are one plausible explanation. Legislative adoption of policies does not always translate to effective implementation on the ground. Evaluating these policies is important for population health because the expected impact on fertility, and other benefits associated with improved educational attainment, will only be realized if they are effectively implemented."
Research Overview: Social Determinants of Women's Health,"['Koski, Alissa']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1084.0,400174,"My research examines the social issues that influence women's health globally and contributes to evidence-based policy making by quantitatively evaluating the effectiveness of policies aimed at improving women's health. My current work focuses primarily on two issues: child marriage and female genital cutting. 

Child marriage, defined by the United Nations as marriage before the age of 18, is associated with poor reproductive and mental health. Most research on child marriage has been conducted in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, but my work examines the health consequences of child marriage in wealthy countries, including Canada. My work also examines the effectiveness of laws that prohibit child marriage and the unintended consequences such policies may have for the health of girls who marry and their children. 

Female genital cutting (FGC) refers to a wide range of procedures that involve injury to the genitalia for non-medical reasons. Severe forms of cutting are associated with increased risks during childbirth and may have lifelong implications for sexual wellbeing. Global efforts to curb this practice have resulted in laws that make it a crime to perform FGC in many countries. However, these laws appear to have had little impact on the number of women who experience it. I am conducting research to better understand why some communities persist in this practice and whether driving the practice underground increases the health risks for girls. 

A common theme of my research is to include policies that affect women's and girls' health in wealthy countries, including Canada, under the umbrella of global health. Wealthy countries are often not considered in global health research but failure to critically examine how their policies align with international development goals may lead to the perpetuation of harms. Throughout my research, I stress that an inclusive definition of global health is a necessary component of Canada's strong leadership in this realm."
Determinants and consequences of child marriage in Canada and the United States,"['Koski, Alissa']","['Iyer, Srividya N', 'Van Roost, Kaya']","['Child Marriage', 'Social Determinants Of Health']",160000.0,451446,"Child marriage, defined by the United Nations (UN) as marriage before the age of 18, is a violation of human rights that affects 650 million girls and women worldwide. Girls are ten times more likely to marry as children than boys, and these marriages make it more likely that they will experience domestic violence, contract sexually transmitted infections, and have poor reproductive health. The UN calls for the elimination of child marriage across the globe by the year 2030. However, child marriage is legal and ongoing in Canada and the U.S., despite efforts by both countries to end the practice abroad. 

Almost nothing is known about child marriage in Canada or the U.S. because nearly all research on this issue has focused on Africa and South Asia. Our team recently documented how often child marriage happens in these two countries. More than 3,600 Canadian children were granted marriage certificates between 2000-18. In the U.S., more than 78,000 children were married between 2010-14. This research was a crucial first step, but more information is necessary. Public health practitioners in both countries need evidence on the drivers of child marriage to identify effective ways to intervene to prevent it. Clinicians need information on the unique health risks faced by married children so they can mitigate its harms among this vulnerable population. Law makers need evidence on the drivers and harms of child marriage to make informed legislative decisions. 

Our research will meet these needs by producing entirely new information on the motivations for and health consequences of child marriage in Canada and the U.S. We will investigate whether premarital teen pregnancy leads to child marriage and whether inconsistencies between laws that govern age at marriage and age for sexual consent create perverse incentives for child marriage. We will also measure the impact of child marriage on the risk of mental health disorders and teen childbearing."
Vitamin D Status and Risk of Ovarian Cancer,"['Kotsopoulos, Joanne']",['N/A'],"['Biomarkers', 'Cohort Studies', 'Epidemiology', 'Gene-Enviroment Interactions', 'Ovarian Cancer', 'Prevention', 'Receptor Expression', 'Risk Factors', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms', 'Vitamin D']",100000.0,179135,"Cancer of the ovary is the leading cause of death among women with gynecological malignancies. Having children, birth control and breastfeeding are protective; however, the prevention through modifiable exposures (diet, lifestyle) is scarce.  Evidence from experimental and ecological studies suggest that vitamin D may reduce ovarian cancer risk.  We recently published the first population-based study indicating an inverse relationship between plasma vitamin D levels and risk of ovarian cancer that was limited to obese women.  We have also shown that individual genetic variation in the vitamin D receptor gene (which mediates the effects of vitamin D) may also affect this relationship. More importantly, there have been no studies evaluating whether characteristics of the ovarian tumor (histology) or the timing of intake (adolescence, premenopause) play a role.  Confirmation of these hypotheses will help identify subgroups of women that would most benefit from vitamin D supplementation.  Thus, the goal of this project is to confirm if vitamin D is protective for ovarian cancer and to evaluate whether such an association is affected by other factors (genetics, obesity).  To carry out these objectives, I will use risk factor information and biologic specimens collected from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and NHSII.  These are two large studies of over 238,000 nurses that have been followed every two years since 1976 (NHS) and 1989 (NHSII) to collect information regarding diet, lifestyle and disease development.  Since dietary vitamin D intake is not an accurate measure of vitamin D status, we have developed a model to predict vitamin D blood levels.  Given that vitamin D levels can be increased by oral supplements, the findings from this study will have important implications considering the limited prevention options currently available. Confirming a role of vitamin D will permit stronger public health advice to decrease the occurrence of this highly lethal cancer."
"A behavioural and electrophysiological investigation of bilingualism and lexical ambiguity processing in healthy aging, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease","['Kousaie, Shanna C']",['N/A'],"['Aging', ""Alzheimer'S Disease"", 'Bilingualism', 'Cognition', 'Communication', 'Event-Related Brain Potentials', 'Executive Function', 'Language Comprehension', 'Lexical Ambiguity', 'Mild Cognitive Impairment']",135000.0,242697,"More than 50% of the world's population is bilingual, yet little research has examined bilingualism in dementia. This research will examine the effect of being bilingual on communication and cognitive function in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Communication is critical for quality of life, and difficulties can lead to conflict, isolation or depression, and earlier institutionalization in patients with cognitive impairment. Recent research shows that the experience of being bilingual provides an advantage in cognitive functioning for healthy older adults; however, this has not been examined in MCI and AD, despite reports that being bilingual is associated with a delay in the onset of AD symptoms by over 4 years.
We will measure various aspects of cognitive function in monolingual and bilingual healthy young and older adults, and MCI and AD patients, and will examine their ability to resolve ambiguity in language (i.e., when a word has multiple unrelated meanings, e.g., ""bank"" which can mean ""financial institution"" or ""river's edge""). We predict that bilingualism will be associated with better cognition, communication, and ambiguity resolution. 
Measures of electrical brain activity will also be included in the proposed research, which will provide a more complete picture of the subtle changes in language processing associated with MCI and AD, and may provide insights that could aid in the early detection of AD.  
The proposed research will increase our understanding of the changes in language and communication associated with MCI and AD. This investigation will be the first to experimentally examine the effect of being bilingual on language processing, cognition, and communication in cognitively impaired patients. The proposed methods will allow us to identify subtle differences in language processing between healthy and cognitively impaired participants, and may thus aid in detecting AD earlier than current methods allow."
Mortality of people incarcerated in provincial facilities in Ontario: A 15 year retrospective cohort study,"['Kouyoumdjian, Fiona G']",['N/A'],"['Cohort Study', 'Mortality']",165000.0,269560,"Internationally, people who are incarcerated tend to have poorer health than the general population, however, little is known about the health status of this population in Canada. Knowledge of the burden of disease of this population would make it possible to prioritize areas for intervention including public health interventions and health system changes.

In this study, I will determine the mortality rate and causes of death for people who were incarcerated in provincial correctional facilities between 1995 and 1996, by linking with death certificate data from 1995 to 2011. I hypothesize that the age- and sex-specific mortality rates of people who have been incarcerated in provincial facilities in Ontario will be high relative to the general population in Ontario, and that in particular, the mortality rates due to preventable diseases such as hepatitis C, HIV, and unintentional injuries will be relatively high.

This study will be used to inform where research and program development should be focused for incarcerated populations in Ontario and elsewhere in Canada. If the hypotheses are correct that the mortality rate is higher than for the general population and that a substantial proportion of deaths are from preventable causes, I will go on to develop interventions to prevent premature death and I will advocate for greater attention to the health of people who are incarcerated in Canada including more accessible and higher quality health services during and subsequent to incarceration."

Antibiotic-induced gut dysbiosis is the proposed mechanism underlying these associations. Our team will use the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study as a platform to assess the risk factors and outcomes from changes in gut microbiota based on fecal samples collected at 3 time points. Microbiota will be measured qualitatively by high throughput signature gene sequencing."

In 2007, 243,000 Canadians were infected. Among infected individuals, one in four will develop cirrhosis and one in eight will die from HCV-related causes. Injection drug users (IDUs) represent the core of the HCV epidemic in Canada, with the majority of new (83%) and existing (58%) infections occurring in this group. In Canada, although research has identified characteristics associated with new cases of infection, little is known about transmission events occurring from pools of infected to uninfected individuals. Further, given ongoing risk behaviours for HCV transmission, it is likely that many IDUs harbour multiple infections. We have assembled a multidisciplinary team of international investigators with expertise across disciplines in the fields of HCV and HIV. The overall goal of this project is to evaluate HCV transmission dynamics among IDUs. First, we are interested in how HCV is transmitted from older to younger IDUs and whether public health initiatives have led to a reduction in transmission. Second, we are interested in understanding how frequently reinfection and mixed infections with HCV occur and what characteristics are associated with reinfection/mixed infections. We plan to conduct this study within well-established cohorts of IDUs in Vancouver, the Vancouver Injecting Drug Users Study (VIDUS) and the At-risk Youth Study (ARYS). Using previously stored blood samples from these studies from 1996 to 2010, we plan to identify participants who developed HCV infection, sequence their virus and investigate HCV transmission networks. We will also use novel technologies to detect mixed HCV infections. Understanding HCV transmission among injection drug users will better guide the development of public health and biomedical strategies for HCV prevention."

Moreover, socioeconomic disparities in pregnancy outcomes such as preterm birth and stillbirth persist in many developing and developed countries, including Canada. The magnitude and patterns of socioeconomic disparities are known to differ across ethnic and cultural sub-groups. Such differences have important implications for the health of Canadians, because approximately one in five Canadians are immigrants, making Canada highly multi-ethnic. Pregnancy and birth outcomes such as the infant mortality rate are not only good measures of current population health but are also predictive of the future health of the population, because health in early life predicts health later in life. Therefore, achieving socioeconomic equity in pregnancy outcomes is an important public health goal. However, existing scientific evidence on socioeconomic disparities in pregnancy and birth outcomes is limited, owing to the lack of detailed socioeconomic and ethno-cultural background information in routinely collected data. Our research will create a national database by linking the national database of pregnancy and birth outcomes (the previously-linked Canadian stillbirth, live birth, and infant death database) with detailed characteristics of parents ascertained in the censuses of 1996 and 2006, so as to be able to systematically examine the patterns of perinatal health in Canada across social, racial, and ethnic groups and over time. This study will provide nation-wide assessment of perinatal health disparities not previously possible in Canada, including robust results of socioeconomic differences in perinatal health for immigrants, visible minorities and Aboriginal people, at both the individual and neighbourhood levels."
Alternative intervention for marijuana use (AIM): Addressing individual risk factors for transitions to initiation and escalation of marijuana use in early adolescence.,"['Krank, Marvin D']","['Goldstein, Abby', 'Stewart, Sherry H', 'Walsh, Zach']","['Brief Interventions', 'Cognitive Assessment', 'Marijuana Use', 'Risk And Protective Factors', 'Targeted Prevention']",87001.0,191763,"Marijuana use is a major problem among youth.  Such use is linked to a host of negative outcomes and risky behaviours, including academic problems, dropping out of school, increased mental health problems, risky sexual activity, unsafe driving practices, and progression to other illicit drug use.  Despite the best intentions, universal prevention programs designed to address this problem in the general population reach only a small number of at risk adolescents effectively.  Research suggests that this lack of success occurs because programs fail to address important individual differences.  These differences mean that many interventions are misdirected and can even produce in some an increased risk for marijuana use.  The present research explores a new way to target differential risk factors for transitions to initiation and escalation of marijuana use in early adolescence.  The approach uses an Ask, Assess, and Advise approach.  The program first asks about a number of critical social, environmental, and cognitive risk factors.  These include past alcohol and tobacco use, cognitive associations with marijuana use, experience with violence and neglect, peer and parent use, and personality traits.   The assessment consists of a novel computer-based coding of responses and classification of risk levels against established risk profiles.  Finally, individual advice targets the specific risk factor and is linked with the assessment.  This program will explore the feasibility of implementing and testing this prevention approach in school-based prevention."
Promoting Healthy Aging Communities: Examining Accessibility and Barriers to Health and Transportation in Rural Canada: A Longitudinal Population-Based Study,"['Krasniuk, Sarah']",['N/A'],['Summer Program In Aging'],,443312,"With an aging population, 20 percent of Canadians will be 65 years or older by 2026. The aging process is often associated with the development of chronic diseases that can limit the ability to participate in everyday activities, including driving. Driving is the primary mode of transportation for most individuals, providing a sense of independence and freedom. Conversely, driving cessation (terminated license) has been associated with loneliness, depression, reduced quality of life, and institutionalization. When individuals are no longer safe to drive, they depend on alternative transportation such as carpooling with friends/family members or public services. Typically, these services are only offered in urban settings. Rural and small communities often have no access to transportation, making it difficult for older adults to access healthcare or participate in social activities. This is further compounded by the fact that the population of rural and small communities is generally older and living with chronic diseases. Moreover, national surveys (e.g., Canadian Community Health Survey) contain cross-sectional data (collected at one time) and not longitudinal data (collected more than once over extended time), making it difficult to examine if transportation problems can lead to changes in health, accessing healthcare services, or social activities. The proposed research project aims to use data from the Canadian Community Health Survey and Canadian Longitudinal Survey on Aging to examine changes in health leading to driving cessation and the health indicators (depression) in those with vs without access to transportation following driving cessation, while controlling for age or gender. Findings from the proposed research project may inform the development of sustainable transportation plans/support to improve the mobility and wellbeing of small and rural communities across Canada."

NTDs are debilitating diseases that disproportionately burden people living in the world's poorest and most vulnerable communities. One NTD, schistosomiasis, or bilharzia, is prevalent in communities in Sub-Saharan Africa. It is contracted by contact with freshwater bodies, where infected snails are present. Routine activities like fetching water, bathing or swimming are at-risk activities for infection. The  chronic complications of untreated schistosomiasis infection in women and girls can lead to pain, bleeding, vaginal discharge and symptoms that look like sexually transmitted infections. The condition can lead to infertility and triples the risk of HIV infection. This chronic condition is called female genital schistosomiasis (FGS). It is estimated that 56 million women and girls in Sub-Saharan Africa are affected by FGS. A recent research project, the FAST Package (""FGS Accelerated Scale Together Package) implemented a holistic approach to address FGS at the health system, clinical and community levels in Ghana and Madagascar. It has recently been scaled up in Ethiopia and Madagascar. This proposal outlines a series of meetings to foster interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers, practitioners and NTD program managers on the FAST Package outcomes. The research upon which the proposed meeting is based investigated the challenges and opportunities for addressing FGS in Ghana and Madagascar. We intend to use this meeting to discuss the findings, develop knowledge translation, plan for scale-up of the interventions and identify areas for future research. The meeting outcomes also include identifying evidence-based strategies for integrating FGS into existing sexual and reproductive health (SRH) programs.  Finally, we will disseminate the findings to Canadian NGOs working in SRH programs in Sub-Saharan Africa."

This means that we will conduct a standardized, broad search, including a search of the grey literature and that two people will assess abstracts for relevance, decide upon inclusion/exclusion, and extract data.  We will also perform analyses under the supervision of a statistician, paying attention to issues around unit of analysis.  We will extract data on a list of process measures.  We will assess ROB, heterogeneity and study quality (with GRADE).  Our knowledge translation plans will be firmed up in consulation with our knowlege users, but will be based on the Knowledge ot Action Cycle.Outputs.We will produce a high-quality Cochrane review and process evaluation. For practitioners, we will develop an implementation guide. Finally, we will develop KT tools that we have previously used successfully: user-friendly summaries, tailored policy briefs, webinars and Infographics.OutcomesTo use public funds well, funders, decision-makers and public practitioners need to know which CFS interventions work, for whom and under what circumstances.Ourimportant and badly needed review will provide users with the best-available evidence on effectiveness of interventions to improve community food security. It will also increase knowledge on how and why various interventions work or don’t work, contextual and political factors that may impede or facilitate success, and ‘best-practices’ in implementation. Our implementation guide will provide practical direction on factors to consider in design and execution. Our work will inform decision making and the practice of CFS interventions; it will also help to set a research agenda."

In Canada, about 1000 Canadian communities have age-friendly initiatives. Plouffe and Kalache noted that the use of outcome indicators to measure changes and impact across the eight Age-Friendly domains is critical for demonstrating the effectiveness of age-friendly communities. The investigators leading this proposal are among the first in Canada to undertake research on age-friendly city initiatives in their municipalities.  Many indicators in our evaluation frameworks rely on data from the CLSA; others rely on built environment data. Currently, little research has been published linking age-friendly communities with the wellbeing of older residents.  Such research is vital as Age-Friendly initiatives across the country represent an enormous amount of effort and cost. 
We plan to use this data, combined with geospatial data to assess progress towards Age-Friendliness in our eight cities.
Our objectives are: 1) To compare key aspects of Age-Friendliness across eight Canadian Cities and to national averages 2) To compare indicators of the physical, mental and social health of aging people in eight Canadian cities and to national averages and to explore the reasons for similarities and differences 3) To identify potential income, sex, rural/urban and linguistic inequalities in determinants of health and health outcomes within and across our cities 
We anticipate several important outcomes. First, we will provide researchers and knowledge users in 8 cities with reports that detail Age-Friendliness of their municipalities.This will help prioritize Age-Friendly actions. Second, this will facilitate the development of a pan-Canadian Age-Friendly research collaboration. Third it will provide us with baseline data to measure impact of Age Friendly interventions. Finallyit will contribute knowledge on impact of these population health interventions"

Evaluating the Wiiji app to improve Indigenous workplace mental health: a mixed-methods approach,"['Kristman, Vicki L']","['Mushquash, Christopher J', ""O'Loughlin, Robyn A""]","['Community-Based Controlled Trial', 'Electronic Application', 'Indigenous Mental Health', 'Mixed-Methods Design', 'Qualitative Research']",367200.0,420602,"There is a need to tailor mental health interventions to the needs of Canadian Indigenous people. Indigenous individuals are less likely to seek help for mental health and accordingly, have rates of suicide at least twice as high as non-Indigenous counterparts. E-health interventions have shown success for several mental health related conditions, including anxiety, depression, sleeping disorders and feelings associated with low self-worth. Yet, only one Australian study has started to explore the acceptability of e-mental health approaches among remote health service providers working with Indigenous populations, and no study has explored the possibility of e-mental health approaches for individual workers and managers within workplaces. So, we developed an e-mental health application (app) for Indigenous workplaces titled 'Wiiji' to improve Indigenous workplace mental health through a CIHR Catalyst Grant: Work Stress and Wellbeing Hackathon. Wiiji provides information on work-related mental health and mental health resources that Indigenous workers can access, and provides a mechanism to connect with a peer-support who can assist the worker in times of stress.The primary goal of this application is to evaluate the app for improvement in Indigenous workplace mental health. We will use a mixed-methods approach to conduct this study. This work will be done in partnership with the Nokiiwin Tribal council, which consists of 5 communities. Results of this project will help us understand the impact of the app and will help us to better understand mechanisms for scale-up.

Cross-cultural considerations and difficulties recruiting and retaining skilled workers in rural and remote regions may contribute to poorer service use for the Indigenous population. Indigenous individuals are less likely to seek help for mental health and accordingly, have rates of suicide at least twice as high as non-Indigenous counterparts. Indigenous individuals who have a solid management of stress in the workplace tend to have better health. Yet, cultural safety in the workplace is a concern and a cause of stress for Indigenous persons. E-health interventions are an attractive style of reducing mental stress in the workplace as they are relatively inexpensive, accessible for rural and hard to reach populations, and easy to administer. The anonymity of e-health interventions prevent stigmatization of the individual - a factor that is of particular importance in working individuals. The proposed project has the potential for significant contribution in 3 important ways: 1) To fill the identified gap and provide Indigenous employees and employers with culturally relevant knowledge regarding mental health and resources accessible to them; 2) To provide Indigenous workers with an opportunity to conduct a self-assessment of their mental health situation and provide suggestions for improvement; and 3) To gain an understanding of the distribution of the burden of mental health issues in the Indigenous community through the collection of e-mental health usage data.

Medical cannabis against chronic musculoskeletal pain - a mixed methods study to describe use and to identify its facilitators and barriers among Canadian patients and doctors.,"['Kroger, Edeltraut', 'Dionne, Clermont']","['Aubin, Michèle', 'Bélanger, Richard', 'Dagenais, Pierre', 'Foldes-Busque, Guillaume', 'Guillaumie, Laurence', 'Pluye, Pierre']","['Canadian Prescribers', 'Canadian Users', 'Medical Cannabis', 'Mixed Methods', 'Musculoskeletal Pain', 'Quebec Cannabis Registry']",124954.0,404019,"It is currently impossible to make appropriate recommendations as to the use of medical cannabis against chronic musculoskeletal pain (CMP), because this question has not been studied sufficiently. Nevertheless, many Canadians suffering from such pain turn to medical cannabis for treatment. Little is known about these users of medical cannabis, as well as about the doctors prescribing it. Knowledge about use of medical cannabis against CMP in Canada would help to inform or educate users and prescribers, and it would be a first step to a user focused program of research on medical cannabis against CMP.
Our project will document:
1-How many Canadians are using cannabis against CMP and what are their characteristics?
2-Why are Canadian physicians prescribing or not prescribing medical cannabis against CMP ?
3-What are the known therapeutic and adverse effects of medical cannabis from the users' and physicians' perspective?
We will use four sources of information: 1) the Quebec Cannabis Registry, 2) the database on medical cannabis of Health Canada, 3) a sample of patients with CMP, including current users of medical cannabis, and 4) a sample of physicians who prescribe or not medical cannabis. This will allow us to describe the recent use of medical cannabis in Canada, its positive and negative effects on CMP according to patients and physicians, and to identify which characteristics of patients and physicians make a difference.
While cannabis seems to be an interesting option for the relief of CMP, it is currently difficult to conduct rigorous randomized clinical trials (RCT) on this topic, because of major methodological and ethical problems. This study will make an essential contribution to knowledge by gathering the currently available information from different sources, and by developing adapted approaches to address the specific challenges of RCTs in this area. These results will eventually lead to clear answers about the utility of medical cannabis against CMP."

Immigrant and refugee populations have been disproportionately hard hit by the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of social and economic disadvantages. These inequalities, if unaddressed, can come at the cost of the wellbeing and adaptation of newcomer youth and contribute to the widening of long-lasting health and educational disparities between immigrant and non-immigrant populations. 
Objective. The Reconnect project adopts a community-based action research approach to investigate the experiences of newcomer youth and their families during and after the pandemic, and to look especially at how school-based interventions can mitigate the effects of the pandemic. Results from our study will contribute to the development of a best practice guide and arts-based dissemination tools for the promotion of wellbeing and resilience in the wake of the pandemic among racialized newcomer communities.
Method. Based on the extensive work of our research team in Montreal during the pandemic, in collaboration with knowledge users and youth, we will adapt and implement specialized classroom- and community-based interventions for newcomer youth and their families. A total of 100 youth (ages 10-13) attending 6 classes for newcomers and 75 parents will participate in the Reconnect interventions. Qualitative (focus groups, fieldnotes) and quantitative data will be collected to explore the experiences of youth, parents, facilitators and teachers and changes in wellbeing (reduction in COVID-related stress, psychological distress) and resilience (positive school climate, family cohesion) from before to after the intervention.
Results. In the short term we will support and empower migrant youth and their families in the wake of the pandemic, and rapidly disseminate critical insights to schools, teachers, and ministries of education. In the long-term, findings will support policy development to address social and health disparities between migrant and non-migrant communities."

A recent Supreme Court of Canada ruling (2012) found that HIV positive individuals are now required to disclose their HIV status except where both a condom is used and the person has a ""low"" HIV viral load; or may otherwise be subject to a conviction of aggravated sexual assault. This decision has drawn significant criticism by both public health and human rights experts in Canada and globally for failing to consider the gendered power dynamics of negotiating male condom use and the associated risks for violence and livelihood as a result of HIV disclosure for women living with HIV. Given the pervasiveness of gender-based violence and ongoing HIV-related stigma, there is a critical need to better understand how the law criminalizing HIV non-disclosure uniquely affects women living with HIV. The central objectives of the proposed study are two-fold:
1) Gain a better understanding of how the criminalization of HIV non-disclosure influences the negotiation of safer sex practices and the experience of violence among women living with HIV.
2) Gain a better understanding of how the criminalization of HIV non-disclosure influences HIV-related stigma and access to HIV treatment and care among women living with HIV. 
The findings of this research will contribute towards building evidence-based HIV policy that considers gendered power dynamics and HIV-related stigma."

Unfortunately, individuals with a history of drug use have not benefited from these advances to the same extent as other people living with HIV/AIDS. Previous research has found fewer HIV positive drug users are accessing HIV treatment compared to other HIV positive individuals. Furthermore, approximately half of the drug users who start HIV treatment do not follow through with it and among those drug users who remain on treatment, 60% do not follow the treatment as prescribed by their doctor. To date, research on factors influencing HIV treatment access and maintenance among individuals with a history of drug use has focused mainly on risk factors that are related to a person's behaviour or to their psychological state. Examples of risk factors for reduced therapeutic success of HIV treatment that have been identified previously include, continued substance use, depression and anxiety. To date, a more complete understanding of the broader influences on access to and maintenance of HIV/AIDS treatment among drug users, such a stigma and discrimination, housing stability and  the way health care services are organized, is still sorely lacking. In order to gain a better understanding of these broader social and structural influences on HIV treatment among drug users, we will systematically analyse the perspectives of HIV positive drug users and service providers on the challenges of accessing and maintaining HIV treatment. The ultimate goal is that findings of the proposed study will contribute to the implementation of policies and programs that support drug users' access to HIV treatment and care."

Despite this, in December 2014 the former Canadian government implemented new legislation to regulate sex work, termed the Protection of Communities and Exploited Persons Act (PCEPA). The PCEPA criminalizes the purchase of sex and anyone who commercially profits from the proceeds of sex work (e.g., receptionists, security personnel, drivers etc.). Emerging research from Canada now suggests that end-demand approaches  such as the PCEPA may recreate the harms of previous punitive approaches, while introducing new restrictions that put sex workers and sex industry actors such third parties (e.g. receptionists, security personnel etc.) in precarious legal positions. The proposed 5-year participatory-action research project aims to evaluate how evolving laws and policies regulating sex work (PCEPA, municipal licensing, policing appoarches, venue-based regulations) shape occupational health (e.g. experiences of physical and sexual violence, negotiation of safer sex practices) and safety (e.g. working conditions, access to workplace protections and labour rights) in the sex industry in Metro Vancouver. This new longitudinal research project will be well positioned to inform sex work law reform efforts, strategic litigation and the development, evaluation and implementation of sex work environment interventions at the municipal-level (e.g. enforcement policies, safe workplace standards for the sex industry, licensing regimes) and community-level (e.g. sex worker tools for safer workplace standards, potential for labour organization, collectivization of workers)."

This is especially true for women living with HIV who face additional health and social inequities, including poverty, housing instability, racism, and illicit substance use. Despite recent advancements limiting the use of criminal laws in governing HIV non-disclosure in Canada, emerging research reveals that coercive public health interventions have the potential to further criminalize women living with HIV. Under public health law, failure to comply with HIV treatment regimens can result in imprisonment. Among the Canadian prison population, women are more likely to report living with HIV compared to men with incarcerated Indigenous women reporting the highest HIV rates. Following release from correctional facilities, women are less likely to be connected to HIV care and experience worse treatment outcomes compared to men. The objectives of the proposed community-based research is to use participatory, qualitative and digital storytelling methods to generate new insights on the gendered impacts of criminalization, public health interventions and incarceration trajectories on the continuity of care and social inequities among WLWH.

To understand the reason for this association, it is necessary to explore what underlying mechanisms contribute to the co-development of these problem issues. The research literature indicates that a primary factor is the influence of peers and family members. Adolescents who have peers and family involved in problem gambling, substance use, and crime are more likely to engage in the behaviours themselves. However, current research does not provide insights into the social context in which this learning process occurs and how it differs for boys and girls. As such, it is difficult to design an intervention for adolescents experiencing these multiple concerns. Through qualitative interviews with 18 male and 18 female adolescents, I will explore if and how interpersonal experiences with peers and family can influence early life development of multiple problem behaviours. My analysis will describe how participants' thought processes (cognitive factors), their perception of their social experiences with peers and family (environmental factors), and their development of problem behaviours (behavioural factors) relate to each other. I will also compare how these processes might differ if the participant is male versus if they are female. This research is important because adolescent prevention and treatment services for problem gambling, substance abuse, and criminal behaviour are scarce and those available are delivered in silos.  With a better understanding of how these behaviours develop together, we can design programs and interventions that treat these problems holistically. In addition, findings on gender from this study may inform the creation of interventions tailored to the unique needs of male and female adolescents experiencing problem behaviour."

With the fastest-growing rates of HIV infection in the world, the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Region faces unique sexual health challenges. 31% of newcomers to Canada reside in Toronto and the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), of which MENA and West Central Asian populations constitute 11%. Additionally, 34.1% of newcomers are youth. Research evidence consistently indicates that young people, particularly those who are LGBTQ youth, girls, and migrants are vulnerable to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) . Though service providers have identified various sexual health needs among youth including knowledge gaps in sex education and access to culturally resonant sexual health supports, no studies have explored how MENA youth navigate sexual health in the Canadian context. Thus, our research question is: what are the key elements of an innovative, strength-focused, resilience-based, and youth-driven intervention that is effective in reducing HIV vulnerabilities and sexual health disparities among MENA youth, including youth with diverse gender identities and sexual orientations?

The overall goal of the proposed study is to develop community-based research partnerships and to develop HIV/STI prevention interventions for and by MENA youth (aged 16-29). Through this project, we aim to: 1) represent MENA youth in sexual health research; 2) engage MENA youth in developing strength-focused HIV/STI prevention intervention 3) support the development of partnerships between MENA youth, service providers, and researchers, 4) develop an inclusive multi-disciplinary CBR team that will steer research activities for a multi-year study to evaluate youth-driven HIV interventions. The study therefore will increase community capacity in responding to sexual health vulnerabilities."

Canada has one of the highest rates of IBD in the world and they are continuing to increase. This is especially true among Canadians over age 65. There are two types of IBD: Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Both diseases cause inflammation and ulcers to develop in the gastrointestinal system and follow unpredictable patterns of active disease and remission. During periods of active disease (flares), patients experience debilitating abdominal pain, diarrhea, and fatigue. Medications can be used to put the disease into remission. Older Canadians with IBD living in rural parts of Canada have less access to gastroenterologists and are more likely to visit the emergency department and be hospitalized. This project will look for variation in how patients over the age of 65 with IBD are treated in different parts of Canada. We will then look to see if the differences in treatment are associated with an increased need for hospitalization and surgery. We will use databases that include information on physician billing, prescriptions, and hospital discharge summaries from 6 Canadian provinces (Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and Saskatchewan). We will analyze data from each province separately and then combine the results to understand differences in treatment and the disease severity across Canada."

Physical activity has been found to be a promising intervention, as it promotes brain health and wards off dementia. More importantly it promotes sleep, which has a strong relationship with brain heath. Evidence is starting to suggest that physical activity and sleep might work together to promote brain functioning, but this has seldom been explored. Using data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, the proposed study will explore age and sex differences for the relationship between sleep and physical activity on brain health. This will help identify the unique differences and challenges for females and males, as well as help target which age groups require additional support. By looking at how sex and age differ between sleep and physical activity, we can promote brain health throughout aging by creating tailored interventions, ultimately to foster a better quality of life for all aging Canadians."
Causes and Implications of Metabolically Healthy Obese,"['Kuk, Jennifer Linche', 'Ardern, Chris I']","['Rotondi, Michael A']","['Cardiovascular Disease', 'Clinical Weight Management', 'Diabetes', 'Epidemiology', 'Metabolic Syndrome', 'Obesity', 'Population Health', 'Weight Loss']",100000.0,286931,"Obesity is a known risk factor for diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD), but the risk may not be the same for all obese people. Some obese individuals may actually be at lower risk for diabetes and CVD than lean people. Recent work also suggests that many people may gain weight due to factors that do not directly contribute to the ""energy in"" and ""energy out"" equation (diet and exercise). These reasons include sleep duration, environmental toxins, or that age at which your mother gave birth to you and may account for some of the differences in health seen in obese people and may influence their ability to lose weight.
The first aim of this project is to determine whether there truly is a healthy obese person. If there is, what factors protect these people from the health problems commonly seen with obesity? Do these healthy obese people benefit from weight loss? If so, how do the presence of traditional or non-traditional risk factors for obesity impact on health and the weight loss achieved?
This work will be done using two approaches. First, use of existing large datasets will allow us to answer our research questions more quickly than if we had to collect all new data. We will also be able to look at repeat visits so that we can assess changes over time, to see how different groups of people with obesity develop health conditions. Some datasets have information on causes of death so that we can also determine how different factors relate with this important outcome. Second, working with the Wharton Weight Management Centre will give us a chance to apply our research findings within an existing clinic that has a better-rounded sample than typical research weight loss studies.
If there are differences in health and weight loss potential between obese people, this work will help physicians more accurately identify high-risk patients and focus care. It will allow public health officials to improve resource planning and health care cost estimates of obesity."

Mental health care providers are finding a number of challenges in providing mental health services to this population and recognize that they currently do not have the knowledge or understanding of the unique belief systems to attend to this group's specific needs. In addition, LGS Mennonites mostly reside in rural areas where mental health services are limited placing greater demands on the already stretched resources of health regions and their health and social service staff. Generating information about mental health wellness and illness among this population will demonstrate being proactive in the development of appropriate policies by decision makers and care guidelines and the health care providers that interact with the LGS Mennonite population. Importantly, the LGS Mennonites will experience more quality mental health care provided by the health professionals and social service provides who care for this population."

Traditionally, low strength or loss of physical performance are identified when measures at one point in time drop below pre-determined cut-offs. However, these cut-offs ignore the impact of important factors such as age and height on function and may not be accurate. They also do not consider that changes in strength and performance may be more important than overall strength and performance, or that performance on multiple measures are better predictors of future outcomes than performance on a single measure. This study aims to remedy these limitations by developing a more personalized and robust approach to identify people with low strength and physical performance. 

Data from ~30,000 Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging participants aged 45 to 85 years will be used to develop a method to predict expected performance and change in performance on five tests of strength and physical performance taking personal factors like age, sex, education, and income into account. The difference between each person's expected performance versus actual performance on the tests will be used together to create a summary score of physical performance. We will also create a single indicator of if someone has low physical performance based on the results of all five tests. We will assess how well our new measures work compared to the traditional ways of assessing physical performance by assessing their ability to predict future health outcomes, such as disability, nursing home admission, home care use, and mortality.

The measures of physical performance developed by this study can be applied in clinical and research settings. They will help identify individuals that may benefit from early interventions to maintain mobility and independence."
"Creating Continuity and Confidence for the Measurement of Canadians Movement Behaviours (Physical Activity, Sedentary Behaviour, and Sleep)","['Kuzik, Nicholas O']",['N/A'],"['Physical Activity', 'Sedentary Behaviour', 'Sleep']",90000.0,454840,"Introduction: Evidence is accumulating for the importance of 24-hour movement behaviours-physical activity, sedentary behaviours, and sleep-on a breadth of health outcomes at all ages. Statistics Canada's Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) is the main surveillance tool for examining movement behaviours at a population level in Canada, and the CHMS is going from measuring isolated movement behaviours to measuring 24-hour movement behaviours. Changes will improve our understanding of movement behaviours in the Canadian population, but challenges in comparing past and future cycles will arise since the CHMS is switching: 1) movement behaviour measurement devices from Actical to ActiGraph accelerometers; 2) wear time protocols from awake wear time to 24-hour wear time protocols; 3) sleep measurement techniques from questionnaire to ActiGraph. Consequently, data discrepancies will occur because of different: device-specific outputs, patterns of missing data when comparing awake to 24-hour wear time protocols, and durations of sleep when comparing questionnaire and accelerometer estimates. The proposed research aims to develop techniques capable of valid and reliable comparisons across movement behaviour measurement cycles.
Objective: Develop techniques to translate accelerometer outputs and compare trends in the movement behaviours of Canadians.
Methods: Participants will simultaneously wear an Actical and ActiGraph accelerometer 24 hours/day for 7 days. Techniques will be created to: 1) translate Actical to ActiGraph outputs, 2) correct any missing data arising from awake wear time protocols, and 3) translate questionnaire and Actigraph sleep estimates.
Significance: This research will allow Canada's evolving movement behaviour surveillance system to determine time trends in movement behaviours, and relationships with a variety of health outcomes, which are crucial for understanding the effectiveness of public health initiatives and steering public health policy."

In Canada, about 1 to 2 children in every classroom have DCD. Parents and teachers tell us these children have problems learning to do everyday motor activities like tying shoelaces, playing ball, and climbing stairs. Some research has shown that these kids are more likely to be overweight, inactive, unfit, and to have more mental health problems by the time they are teenagers. Unfortunately, many of these children are not identified, and therefore do not get the help they need when they need it. To understand how to help kids with DCD, we need to be able to determine when they begin to be less active and less healthy, both physically and mentally. The goal of our study is to keep observing a large group of children with and without DCD who we have been following since they were 4 or 5 years old. We will continue following them once per year until they are 10 and 11 years old. At each visit, we will keep measuring their motor coordination, how much physical activity they do, how fit they are, their diet, and how much they weigh. We will also start to ask the children questions about how they feel about themselves and if they are feeling anxious or depressed. What makes our study new and exciting is that we will be able to find out when children with DCD start to become less active and less healthy. Working with doctors, teachers, and parents will help us make sure that we recognize kids with DCD as young as possible so that they are able to get the right type of support, at the right time, before they become inactive, obese, or depressed."

Despite the many benefits associated with physical activity (PA) participation, only 9% of children and youth in Canada are meeting optimal PA guidelines. Importantly, new immigrant children and youth are at an even higher risk of being inactive compared to non-immigrants. In addition, research suggests that immigrants experience poorer health as their time in Canada increases, which may be linked to patterns of inactivity. Addressing inactivity is a complex issue, but some experts have argued that youth today lack a) the necessary movement skills; b) motivation; c) knowledge; and d) positive feelings to be physically active. Together these elements are referred to as physical literacy (PL). The concept of PL has gained recent attention, both in schools and the community; however, up to this point, the interest and its assumed benefits have exceeded the evidence to support it. The current proposal will bring together a group of researchers and stakeholders with interest in using PL as a vehicle to improve the health and wellbeing of recent immigrant and refugee youth to Canada. This planning grant brings together an interdisciplinary academic team and diverse community stakeholders to help formalize partnerships and to strengthen future funding opportunities. In addition to pre- and post-meeting activities, the proposed two-day in person meeting will help to shape a meaningful intervention targeting newcomer youths and methods for its evaluation."

There is also growing evidence that influenza may trigger heart attacks and strokes. However, past studies were not able to identify influenza as the specific cause of these events. Therefore, the first objective of this proposed research is to see if influenza infections that are confirmed by lab tests are related to heart attacks and strokes. We will do this by linking data from the Public Health Ontario Laboratories and several large hospitals in Ontario to health care records. We will then use statistical tests to see if people are more likely to have a heart attack or stroke shortly after having influenza (confirmed by lab testing), compared to other times. Getting a flu shot each year is the most effective way to prevent influenza infection, but we are not sure how well influenza vaccines actually work, especially for high-risk groups. The second objective of this proposed research is to use the linked data to study how well influenza vaccines work to protect these groups of people from being hospitalized or dying from influenza.  We will do this by looking at people who tested positive influenza and those that who tested negative for influenza and see how many in each group received the vaccine.

The Ontario Burden of Infectious Diseases Study found that in a population of 12.2 million, infectious diseases cause over 7 million healthcare episodes and nearly 5,400 deaths each year. Vaccines are among the greatest achievements in public health, preventing many infectious diseases. My research involves studying patterns of infectious diseases and the impact that vaccines have, both at the level of individuals and in populations, so that we can better prevent these diseases. Linking records about individuals across multiple databases (while maintaining the privacy of the individuals) is very useful for research studies. These linkable databases have been used in many studies about heart disease, cancer, and drug safety, but they have not been used as much for infectious diseases. My research will use many different databases, including healthcare records (e.g., hospitalizations, visits to doctors), information from telephone surveys, and laboratory results to answer important questions about infectious diseases. I will do research in four main areas: 1) understanding patterns of influenza (the ""flu"") and influenza vaccines (""flu shots""), in particular whether there are differences in the frequency of influenza and other types of infections between various ethnic groups, and measuring how well influenza vaccines work in seniors; 2) ranking various infectious diseases in terms of their impact on the health of the population and estimating how much infectious diseases cost to the healthcare system; 3) understanding patterns of healthcare use for some other infectious diseases such as HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) and hepatitis B and C; and 4) improving the way influenza vaccination programs are delivered in Canada. This research will improve care for patients as well as the delivery of public health programs, so that the impact of infectious diseases can be reduced for all Canadians."

Once we identify in which disease subtype each patient belongs to, we can apply genetic analysis methods to find the genes causing each sub-type of disease. Specifically, we focus on studies where clinical measurements have been assessed on entire families.  Individuals within families are obviously related to each other and the statistical model we develop specifically takes into account the individuals kinships.  This novel method will increase the ability of researchers to find the genes responsible for complex diseases. Finding those genes will provide a better understanding of complex diseases that may ultimately lead to improved preventive and therapeutic interventions."
A longitudinal perspective on power mobility use by older users,"['Labbé, Delphine']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,364488,"Power wheelchairs (PWC) are essential devices, especially for people with severe disability. PWC can increase mobility, participation and well-being, but they may also be problematic in terms of usability, safety, and cost. Currently, little is known about power mobility use over time. This study explores how the experiences of older users of PWC change during their life. Participants from Vancouver, Montreal and Québec City (Canada) were interviewed over a period of 2 years about their daily experience of power mobility and the environmental barriers and facilitators. The participants use of power mobility changed over time because of their changing physical capabilities and because they develop skills to drive their PWC. The PWC gave them a feeling of freedom and allowed them to be part of their community. For some participants, the PWC became part of who they are. Unfortunately, the participants encountered many physical barriers and had to deal with the attitude of the public. This study provides new insights on the experience of older PWC users, and thus will help stakeholders to understand the complexity of power mobility provision and users' engagement in meaningful activities."

Overweight and obesity also reduces the overall quality of life of a person's life, as well as the number of years that a person will live. Because of the diseases that overweight and obese people have, the amount of money spent on health care is also very high.
 
We will: 1) look at the food supply (grocery stores and restaurants) and assess the nutritional quality of foods; 2) measure Canadians' opinions and responses to the food supply, such as the reasons for purchasing different types of food; 3) ask about the types and amounts of foods that Ontarians eat, so that we can measure the quality of their diet; 4) link what Ontarians are eating with information on health (medical records); and 5) work with a health economist to determine the health care costs due to a poor diet and obesity. Each study adds new information about how to improve personal health and the health of Canadians. This will allow us to make recommendations to government and other organizations on how they can help prevent and reduce overweight and obesity.

However, the potential for these approaches to reduce chronic disease deaths in Canada has not been evaluated. The goal of this research project is to determine how many chronic disease deaths can be avoided through three strategies: 1) lowering the total sugar content of Canadian packaged foods (total sugar includes free and naturally-occurring sugars), 2) lowering the free sugar content of Canadian packaged foods, and 3) reducing the proportion of foods in the diet that are ultra-processed.  We believe that all strategies will lead to lower free sugar and calorie intakes and fewer deaths, with the greatest success in strategies 2 and 3. Three studies are proposed for this project. The first study will determine the changes in calorie and free sugar content at the food supply level for strategies 1 and 2. We will use the 2017 version of our database of food and beverage labels.

The goal of this research is to determine how food price relates to food healthfulness, the introduction of food policies, and consumer purchases. Four studies will be conducted. Study 1 will examine the relationship between food price and healthfulness (i.e. the level of ""less healthy"" nutrients and overall ""healthfulness""). This study will use food price and nutrient information from our database of food and beverage labels (FLIP) collected in 2017. Study 2 will compare the price of foods that have lower sodium levels and meet the Sodium Reduction Strategy targets with those that have higher sodium levels. Study 3 will evaluate the price of foods before, in-between, and after the Healthy Eating Strategy is in force. Study 2 and 3 will use FLIP collections from 2017, 2020, and 2023. Study 4 will determine how consumer food purchases differ over time for the foods found to be more expensive in Studies 3, especially by low income households. This will be done using a representative database of Canadian household food purchases. We think the relationship between food price and healthfulness will be different for each food category, but in general, healthier foods will be more expensive. Also, foods with nutrient levels that changed in response to food policies will be more expensive and purchased less often than foods that stayed the same. This research will help us better understand how food price and healthfulness are related. It will also provide information to help improve food policies to ensure that regardless of income, all Canadians can benefit."

We aim to build skills and capacities for trans community members and healthcare providers. We will then research priority trans issues of mental health, sexual health and primary care services. Our research will be community-based and guided by an advisory board. Our work is guided by life course and minority stress theories, intersectionality, and a social ecological perspective. Our project has three phases: community consultation, capacity building, and data collection. We are focused on the Vancouver Island health authority region of British Columbia. We will ask trans people how they want to participate in research. We will teach healthcare providers and policy makers about trans people and health issues. We will use both qualitative and quantitative methods. We will conduct interviews or focus groups with 300 transgender patients in the Island Health Region. Next we will run an online survey of 300 diverse trans people across British Columbia. Our team has diverse academic, community, and professional training. We have health policy and service leaders from Rainbow Health Cooperative, TransCareBC and the Vancouver Island Health Authority. These leaders will ensure our research results are taken up into policy and programs. Over half of our team are trans people and we are committed to supporting the next generation of trans health researchers. This project will provide a trans perspective on patient engagement in health research. This initial research will help launch a larger program of research to evaluate and improve the health equity of trans people living in British Columbia."

As an ongoing health crisis, HIV/AIDS continues to shape this community as transmission among Vancouver's gay population remains disproportionately high; recent increases in HIV diagnoses among young gay men (aged <30) offer further cause for concern. Despite the continued impact of HIV/AIDS, little work has been done in Vancouver to document the experiences of gay men and their allies in the early AIDS years. This project aims to initiate the documentation of the experiences of early survivors of the epidemic and their allies in Vancouver. Our research objectives are to: 1) Examine the messages that older gay men and their allies have for younger gay men, health care providers, and health researchers; 2) Analyze how the experiences of AIDS survivors and their allies can be shared to improve care for those living with HIV presently and invigorate contemporary HIV prevention efforts; 3) Articulate how the accounts and experiences of indigenous men, and other people of colour, differ from those of white men; 4) Examine how the experiences of participants resonate with, or diverge from, other national settings; 5) Preserve the history of this time by archiving participants' stories. Our interdisciplinary, community-based team will conduct and record up to 30 peer-facilitated oral history interviews with 15-25 older gay men (born before 1970) of varying HIV statuses and ethnicities and 5-10 allies who contributed to the grassroots response to the epidemic. Interviews will be highly open-ended and participants will be encouraged to share their stories about HIV/AIDS, including how the epidemic manifested in their lives and their community and how their perspectives on HIV have changed over time. Interviews will be subjected to a thematic analysis and a variety of archival, research, and arts-based outputs will be generated."

Within this population, only a small proportion have ever acquired syphilis. Further analyses suggest that syphilis risk is driven by individuals with larger sexual networks. Consequently, syphilis infections among 2SGBTQ people are clustered in large urban centres across Canada, within so-called geographic ""hotspots."" It is apparent that the education and uptake of syphilis prevention strategies have not been sufficient to eradicate syphilis. The aim of this catalyst grant proposal is to leverage community-based surveillance data to explore the development of tailored and evidence-based syphilis prevention strategies within hotspot neighbourhoods across Canada. To accomplish this aim, we will (1) Identify syphilis hotspots by calculating syphilis infection rates using community-based survey data and validating the identified hotspots using public health surveillance data, (2) Identify and compare the prevalence of the risk management practices associated with the greatest reduction in syphilis risk for 2SGBTQ people within hotspot and non-hotspot regions; and (3) Assess the acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness of under-utilized community and public health risk management strategies that could reduce syphilis risk within hotspot and non-hotspot regions. To accomplish these aims, we will use serial cross-sectional data from the 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022 Sex Now Survey, Canada's largest and longest running enhanced surveillance study of 2SGBTQ. Sex Now employs a community-based design, recruits large samples of 2SGBTQ in each cycle, and collects survey data and biological specimens (e.g., dried blood spots). Survey data includes a wide variety of behavioural, social, and structural variables that play an important role in syphilis transmission."

However, studies suggest that certain sub-communities of MSM who would benefit from these medications are currently underserved. For example, MSM who identify as bisexual or heterosexual, those living in rural or remote areas, or those who are Black, Indigenous or other people of colour, may be especially unlikely to use oral HIV prevention medications, leaving them and their sexual partners at higher HIV risk. Through one-to-one interviews with MSM from underserved subcommunities in BC, our community-based project will identify barriers to using PrEP for these groups. We will explore their feelings about different ways of accessing PrEP, and how this could be made easier. We will also explore their opinions about and preferences for different forms of HIV prevention, including oral and long-acting injectable forms of these medications. Our research will help healthcare providers, community organizations and public health bodies to better understand the HIV prevention needs of underserved MSM.

SunFit Project: Skin cancer prevention through behavioural risk factor modification targeting sun and ultraviolet exposure practices using gender- and community-specific approaches,"['Lagace, Francois']",['N/A'],"['Cancer Prevention', 'Epidemiology', 'Health Promotion', 'Primary Prevention', 'Risk Modification', 'Skin Cancer', 'Sun Exposure', 'Survey Study', 'Ultraviolet Radiation']",105000.0,458794,"Background: Cutaneous melanoma (CM) causes more deaths than any other skin cancer. In Canada, CM is the 8th most commonly diagnosed cancer and the number of CM cases is increasing. There are many well-known and modifiable risk factors for developing CM, such as ultraviolet radiation exposure. Nonetheless, there are less CM public health awareness campaigns in Canada compared to other countries, such as Australia. This translated into a decreased awareness of the severity of CM, especially amongst young adults.
Objectives: To understand how various risk factors affect CM incidence in different Canadian populations and communities. Our specific goals are:
1) Explore adolescents/young adults' perspectives on sun exposure;
2) Explore existing SunSmart programs in Australia and their applicability in Canada through focus groups with the goal of developing and studying gender-, community- and geographic region-specific recommendations to help change sun exposure practices.
Methods: Our CM prevention program is supported by three interrelated pillars: behaviour change, patient and public involvement (PPI), and tailored sustainable intervention strategies. 1) A validated patient questionnaire will be distributed online and in-person to assess individual knowledge of CM risks and sun protective behaviours and beliefs, and data will be compared between groups of interest. 2) We will conduct semi-structured focus groups where participants will be prompted to discuss what drives their sun protective behaviours and potential tailored messages as part of a campaign promoting behaviour changes.
Impact: Reducing incidence rates of CM through research, awareness and advocacy is our ultimate goal. This study will allow us to gain valuable and actionable insights into specific factors which will improve targeted efforts and help develop key messages that resonate with impacted populations, thereby increasing their efficacy and potentially influence changes in policies."

"Longitudinal cognitive aging trajectories and diversity using online datasets of over 60,000 people","['LaPlume, Annalise A']",['N/A'],"['Attention', 'Computational Modelling', 'Diversity', 'Individual Differences', 'Lifespan Cognition', 'Memory', 'Online Studies', 'Variability']",,443261,"As people get older, they often wonder ""Is my brain working normally? Should I see a doctor?"". If your body is not working normally, you can easily use tools to measure your blood pressure or temperature. Wouldn't it be great to have something similar when you are worried about your memory, say, a thermometer for the mind?

In my research, I study web-based versions of highly reliable psychological tools. By simply clicking on a link in their own home, people can do a number of memory and attention tests online, and then get a score telling them how well they perform for their age, and whether they should see a doctor. These online tools also help researchers by allowing us to study how memory and attention change with age in tens of thousands of people.

My research on aging seeks to map out:
1. How mental abilities change with age, and,
2. diversity in aging. 

I study which things enhance your mental performance (e.g., education, bilingualism), and which things worsen performance (e.g., smoking, not managing your blood pressure). 

I do this by using massive datasets of over 60,000 people from ages 10 to 90 who did online memory and attention tasks. I then calculate exactly what happens to a person during every year of aging. Thus I create mathematical models of aging over the lifespan.

It is important to study mental abilities such as memory and attention since they are important for everyday life, and they change a lot with age. The Summer Program in Aging is an ideal match for my research on modelling changes in mental abilities with age. 

Studying aging in a person over time is very important (we call this longitudinal aging) to truly understanding aging. Most aging studies will compare 70 year olds to 20 year olds. However, age itself is not aging. Not all 70-year olds are the same, and a 70 year old would have been raised very differently to a 20-year old. My work tackles the societally important questions of mental aging, and also, diversity in aging."

Par exemple, nous ne nous présentons pas et n'agissons pas de la même manière lors d'une entrevue pour un emploi à l'international, que lors d'une fête d'amis dans notre ville natale. Beaucoup d'Inuit (une population autochtone vivant majoritairement dans l'Arctique canadien) doivent faire preuve de cette capacité d'adaptation lorsqu'ils s'installent dans le sud du Québec, un milieu socioculturel très différent des communautés nordiques. C'est notamment le cas lorsqu'ils souhaitent avoir accès aux services de santé :  beaucoup modifient délibérément leur apparence et leur manière d'agir et d'interagir avec les professionnels de la santé pour obtenir les soins dont ils ont besoin - un phénomène pourtant sous-étudié et donc encore mal compris. En partenariat avec le centre de santé familial et communautaire inuit Qavvivik, cette recherche développera une meilleure compréhension des pratiques interpersonnelles et organisationnelles qui contribuent à rendre l'environnement de soins culturellement sécuritaire pour les Inuit urbains afin de soutenir la transformation de ces pratiques et de contribuer à réduire les barrières auxquelles font face les Inuit lorsqu'ils tentent d'accéder au système de santé. Pour ce faire, le phénomène de cross-cultural code-switching en milieu clinique, entre les patients inuit et les professionnels de la santé non autochtones, sera étudié en profondeur. Ensuite, les implications de cette dynamique sur l'atteinte d'une expérience positive, culturellement sécuritaire et bénéfique en milieu de soins pour les Inuit urbains seront discutées avec Qavvivik pour en faire ressortir les éléments positifs pouvant appuyer la transformation des pratiques interpersonnelles et organisationnelles en milieux cliniques montréalais."

The rates of HIV infection and disease are increasing in the Indigenous population in Canada and Manitoba. In discussions and meetings with First Nations in northern Manitoba we recognized that we know and understand very little about the experiences of First Nation people who are living with HIV and are navigating the HIV care cascade. Engaging individuals living with HIV into early antiretroviral treatment will delay progression to AIDS and importantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission in heterosexual and homosexual couples. First Nations in northern Manitoba experience barriers to HIV testing, treating and care which include stigma, access to services, geographic isolation and barriers derived from historical racism and trauma, colonialism, poverty and personal and community circumstances. There is limited understanding of culturally appropriate best practices for HIV testing and care for northern Manitoban First Nations people and a perceived lack of integration of First Nation cultural ways of knowing and healing practices with western medicine practices. We propose to build on existing relationships between northern First Nations knowledge keepers (people and organizations), academia, Provincial and Federal health organizations and the Manitoba HIV Collective Impact Network to establish ethical spaces and use a two-eyed seeing approach to investigate the complexities of how First Nations and northern residents come to be tested, linked to care, and supported to live with HIV. We will work collectively to develop culturally appropriate interventions, tools, programs and polices that can be used by communities, northern First Nation health organizations, and provincial and federal HIV related programs to better support northern First Nations people living with HIV."
The gut microbiome and estrogen receptor-­positive female breast cancer,"['Larnder, Ashley']",['N/A'],"['Cancer Prevention', 'Diet', 'Health And Lifestyle', 'Hormone-Receptor Positive Breast Cancer', 'Intestinal Microbiome', 'Metabolomics', 'Metagenomics']",105000.0,476064,"Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer across the globe. Though survival rates have been increasing, those who survive face serious negative health impacts, such as the adverse side effects of treatment and large psychological burdens. Approaches to prevent breast cancer could therefore significantly improve population health. 

Estrogen is a known cause of hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer, the most prevalent form of breast cancer. Recent research has shown that bacteria residing in the gut (the gut microbiome) can influence estrogen levels in the body and suggest that it may contribute to the development of breast cancer. Due to limited clinical studies in humans, this pathway is not understood well enough to take advantage of for therapeutic measures. 

Our project therefore aims to better explain the role of the gut microbiome by conducting a study of 70 women newly diagnosed with HR-positive breast cancer and comparing them to 70 women without cancer. Questionnaires on lifestyle and diet will inform health factors and stool samples will provide the type and quantity of bacteria present in the gut microbiome. Based on current research, we expect to find women with breast cancer to have higher amounts of estrogen-related bacteria compared to women without cancer. Our deeper sequencing methods will better define these bacterial differences which can then inform possible ways to alter the gut microbiome environment, as it is modifiable by factors such as lifestyle, diet, and probiotic supplementation. This may open the door to a pathway for prevention as well as for improving current treatment methods, as certain microbiome environments have been linked to improved cancer treatment outcomes. Overall, this project will provide an important step forward in approaches for improved cancer therapy and prevention."

Untreated pain, including that associated with poor ear and oral health, have a profound impact on children in terms of their social-emotional wellness, hearing and language development and consequently, their school readiness.  The aim of the project is to create and evaluate a community-led care model to improve ear and oral health outcomes thereby enhancing school readiness for children (0-5 years) in 8 First Nation communities in Wolastoqey and Mi'kma'ki territories. 
Case study design with Two-Eyed Seeing Approach:
1. Storytelling & Narratives - Using storytelling and narratives and a practical evaluation method, we will gather community, provider and government program information about the processes in place to know, prevent, assess and manage both ear and oral health in First Nation children.
2. Model of Care - Based on information from item 1 we will customize for each community and implement a novel model of care, optimizing on community strengths and addressing identified gaps in ear/oral health needs. 
3. Evaluation - Through exploration of school readiness and ear/oral health status, before and after model of care implementation, we will determine the facilitators and impact of the proposed model of care.  
Summary: The current project will combine knowledge from community leaders/Elders, provincial, regional and agency leadership and primary/specialist care providers to identify community strengths and strategies to improve ear/oral health prevention and treatment outcomes. A feasible, community-developed/validated care model will be established with the intention of identifying strategies to adapt and scale-to other communities."

Two-Eyed Seeing is an approach that recognizes the strengths of both Indigenous and western perspectives. As a successful candidate to the Indigenous Research Chair in Nursing, I will use the principles of Two-Eyed Seeing to guide 3 objectives: 1) Advance knowledge about Indigenous health nursing research that will optimize the well-being of children and youth; 2) Advance knowledge in Indigenous health nursing education to seed success, de-colonize curriculum, create culturally safe learning spaces, training and mentorship; 3) Identify and share community knowledge and 'wise practices' to advance Indigenous health nursing practice.

As the non-Indigenous academic co-lead of the Aboriginal Children's Hurt and Healing (ACHH) Initiative I have been mentored by communities for over 12 years and fostered meaningful research relationships in Mi'kma'ki. Through relationships with Elders, mentors, partners, and trainees I have been honoured to learn Indigenous ways of knowing and doing necessary to change the course for the next generation of children and youth to thrive. The ACHH Initiative and an extensive list of collaborators and partners have led successful research and knowledge mobilization efforts demonstrating an impact on curriculum, care settings and communities. Building on existing capacity and the strengths of the Dalhousie Nursing program, plus an Indigenous health research-intensive environment, the Chair will create a culture for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous learners to understand Indigenous history, culture and ways of knowing and doing to provide evidence-based culturally appropriate care to Indigenous children, families and communities."

Thus, this fact contributes to widening the gap in health status between people. Though, several potential solutions have been identified to reduce this inequality, including developing eHealth tools with the participation of more vulnerable people, which makes it possible to integrate their literacy level, learning ability, way of seeking help, cultural context and ability to access technology into the tool. Unfortunately, there is currently no way for eHealth tool developers to observe effectively and quickly whether these solutions are well integrated into the development of their tool and the purpose of this study is to remedy this. This study consists of 5 steps: 1) Documentary research: to identify in the scientific literature all existing measurement indicator that could be used to achieve the objective. 2) Group interviews with experts: to find out what they think about the measurement indicators found in the literature search and identify others. 3) Semi-structured interviews with vulnerable people: They are experts in experience and can bring a rich perspective to recognize whether measurement indicators actually measure what they are supposed to measure while remaining respectful of the target groups. 4) Choice of indicators. 5) Online Questionnaire sent to eHealth tool developers: to assess whether the selected measurement indicators are applicable, useful, relevant, valid and user-friendly. This study will allow developers to use measurement indicators to develop and evaluate their eHealth tool so that it is accessible to all future users and contribute to digital health equity. This innovation will make Canada a leader in improving health care in the digital environment."

1. In comparable jurisdictions, what mechanisms, strategies, and contextual factors have led to policies beyond the health sector that improve health (i.e., HiAP)? 
2. How have these approaches to HiAP addressed health equity and/or targeted health inequities in marginalized populations?
3. What strategies have been used to measure the benefits and costs of such public policies?
We have assembled a strong core team with expertise in evidence synthesis methods, appropriate topic expertise, and experience working with decision makers.

POs are essential medications for effective pain care; however, their non-medical use is associated with major negative health consequences such as accidental overdose deaths. The issue of PO misuse, harms and interventions has become a major public health and policy challenge in Canada. 
Fischer and colleagues have recently examined quantitative and qualitative medical PO dispensing patterns in the 10 Canadian provinces for the period 2005-2010. They found an overall increase in POs dispensed during this period in all provinces, primarily driven by use increases in strong POs. However, significant inter-provincial differences (amounting to almost factor 4) were found regarding the population-based quantities of POs used, as well as in the types of POs used. 
Based on the current literature and Fischer et al.'s data, the proposed research project aims at clarifying a number of essential issues. The project will extend Fischer et al., analysis of quantitative and qualitative PO dispensing patterns across the Canadian provinces for the period 2011-2013, will identify the determinant of the inter-provincial differences (e.g., electronic Prescription Monitoring Programs) and finally will assess to which extent the qualitative and quantitative differences in provincial PO dispensing patterns are associated with differences in morbidity mortality outcomes."

La recherche, limitée aux relations d'un soir, a noté l'existence de dépression chez les filles impliquées. Le dialogue avec les jeunes doit toutefois reposer sur une bonne compréhension de leur réalité globale. Combien d'adolescents sont réellement impliqués dans ces comportements variés? Est-ce une exploration momentanée? Est-ce un moyen de se rapprocher d'un éventuel partenaire avec qui ils établiraient un lien intime? Ces expériences favorisent-elles leur épanouissement ou amènent-elles des  problèmes de santé? Sont-elles exercées par libre choix ou sous pression? Malheureusement, on en sait encore peu au Canada sur la sexualité des adolescents et encore moins sur ces comportements. Il est de plus reconnu que les jeunes ne parlent pas de ces expériences avec des adultes. Afin de compléter les sources d'information que sont devenus les médias pornographiques et les pairs, il faut que les adultes significatifs les entourant disposent de meilleures connaissances.

2.Develop a FNHSSM-based agile platform, for modeling community pandemics, to be updated with live data. Models will be developed with data from community profiles, evidence of transmission and severity derived from the literature and approaches co-created through knowledge exchange via a series of monthly meeting; and
3.Estimate the potential financial and social burden on FN communities, in view of ensuring adequate resourcing to support local responses;

Our overarching goal is to strengthen MIA's ability to engage and respond to pandemics, by expanding its data sovereignty capacity. This proposal is a first step towards the development of an Inuit-centric, state-of-the-art data sovereignty infrastructure built to support MIA's role as an advocate and service delivery organization serving the needs of Inuit. This project will, 
1.Develop Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit-informed governance and management policies to ensure Inuit data sovereignty;
2.Create and implement a respondent driven survey mapping where Manitoba Inuit reside, their circumstances and their needs;
3.Survey Manitoba Inuit to document the impact of COVID-19; and 
4.Create a data infrastructure to expand MIA's ability to document, advocate for and improve its COVID-19 and other work, and to support MIA's advocacy with federal, provincial and territorial governments.
Our project will result in a sustainable Manitoba-led, MIA-based Inuit infrastructure that can be mobilized quickly to support informed decision-making on emerging issues (pandemics), and document needs for program delivery and advocacy. Our approach aligns with Indigenous self-determination and Inuit' aspiration for data sovereignty. Our work will be grounded in discussions (Integrated Knowledge Translation adapted to reflect Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit) with feedback provided by the Isumataiit Sivuliuqtii (Inuit Elders)."

It is therefore highly probable that behavioural prevention policies, including additional vaccine doses, mask wearing, and distancing, may need to be re-introduced. In fact, many governments (including Canada) are already preparing for how to manage the next wave of the pandemic. 
This application is seeking to extend our current CIHR-funded iCARE study beyond its current funding window to continue to monitor population attitudes, intentions and behaviours in relation to engaging in COVID-19 prevention behaviours as measures become increasingly relaxed/lifted, and in relation to the potential re-introduction of preventive measures if/when this may become necessary. We will also assess what factors would motivate people to re-engage in these behaviours, including how people have been negatively impacted by the pandemic and its prevention policies (e.g., psychologically, socially, interpersonally, financially, and medically), in general and among vulnerable groups (e.g., racial & ethnic minorities, women, those with mental/ physical health conditions). The existing infrastructure of the iCARE study will be leveraged to rapidly adapt and extend ongoing population assessments so that we may continue to provide timely data to local and international governments to inform policy. We will collect data in Canada and a sample of key countries (i.e., Italy, Ireland, France, Australia, and Colombia) chosen based on their relative position to Canada on the pandemic curve, their diverse policy approaches and impacts, and their geographical and population diversity."

The Canadian 24-hour movement guidelines encourage a daily balance; yet, only 9% of Canadian children meet the recommended 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous PA per day. Further, only 24% of Canadian children and youth meet the guideline of no more than two hours of recreational screen time per day, and 31% of children are sleep-deprived. These behaviours are interactive, such that screen time can disrupt sleep and displace PA, while lack of sleep can reduce PA and is linked to increased screen time. Schools are an ideal setting for recalibrating children's health behaviours, yet research has not examined the independent and relative contributions of school day segments (PE, breaks, instructional time) as well as contextual and regional factors (e.g., school schedules, urban/rural) influencing these behaviours within the 24-hour context. The proposed research aims to improve children's ability to meet the 24-hour movement guidelines by identifying school day opportunities for increasing PA and reducing SB, and then implementing feasible theory-based and context-specific strategies with a meaningful impact on children's behaviour.  We will use a collaborative whole-school approach that engages key community stakeholders (parents, teachers, administrators, health promoters, students). Specifically, we will longitudinally measure 24-hour activity patterns and mental health of children in Grades 1-8 in NE and SW Ontario over a 3-year period, while assessing stakeholders' perceptions of children's PA, SB, and sleep patterns. This data will help inform and evaluate intervention strategies. Our research addresses important gaps related to children's PA, SB, sleep, and the importance of theory- and school-based strategies on children's 24-hour activity patterns."
Social Determinants of the Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis epidemic: Comparing Social Dynamics in South Africa and Peru,"['Law, Stephanie']",['N/A'],"['Disease Transmission Modeling', 'Emerging Infectious Diseases', 'Global Health', 'Infectious Diseases', 'Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis', 'South Africa', 'Tuberculosis']",105000.0,307781,"Tuberculosis (TB) is the second leading cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide. TB causes disease in over 9 million persons and kills more than 1.5 million each year. While the estimated numbers of new TB infections and TB-related deaths have been falling since 2002, the worldwide emergence of strains that are resistant to the two most effective TB drugs - INH and Rifampin - threatens the progress made. These strains, known as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), cause between 8-9% of all TB deaths globally. More than half a million patients were estimated to develop MDR-TB in 2010. This drug-resistant strain of TB requires more costly, lengthy and toxic treatment that is often ineffective.

Existing research suggest there are many socioeconomic and health factors driving the MDR-TB epidemic, however it remains unclear which of these factors are most influential, and what the priority areas for programmatic changes should be in countries where the epidemic is rapidly growing. 

There has been an enormous increase in MDR-TB over the past couple decades in South Africa and Peru. Between 2002 and 2008, the proportion of all reported TB cases in South Africa with MDR-TB increased from 3.1% to 9.6%. Meanwhile, the notification rate of MDR-TB in Peru has been increasing at approximately 4.3% per year since 1996. Although existing research has suggested many factors that contribute to the MDR-TB epidemic, there has been limited research exploring the social determinants of MDR-TB in any country, and even fewer modelling of how social dynamics may contribute to the epidemic. This project will use a mixed-methods approach consisting of ethnographic studies in Peru and South Africa, and disease simulation modelling to identify common pathways to the transmission and development of MDR-TB, and help identify key opportunities for intervention in both countries, and potentially globally."

We also aim to assess the impact of legalization on mental health care utilization and evaluate the impact of legalization on daily or near-daily cannabis use in this group. This is a retrospective cohort study using Ontario HIV Treatment Network Cohort Study (OCS) and ICES data to investigate before-after legalization changes in mental health, health care and cannabis utilization among Ontarians with HIV. Our findings will fill a knowledge gap regarding the impacts of cannabis use on the mental health and health service utilization of people living with HIV in the context of legalization and will establish groundwork for a province-wide research agenda on cannabis use among Ontarians living with HIV."
Strengthening Health Research Capacity in the Yukon: How Yukon's SPOR Unit is Partnering with First Nations to Advance Health Research Priorities,"['Leach, Michelle']",['N/A'],"['Capacity Building', 'Community Based Research', 'Indigenous Health', 'Patient Oriented Research', 'Principles Of Ocap']",8000.0,485593,"Research in the north, especially with Indigenous communities, was traditionally accomplished with a helicopter fly in approach: university researchers would collect data and leave. Participants were not included in the research process, and often did not hear about the research findings. This method of research did not move us towards a path of reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. Indeed, western-oriented academic approaches fail to promote Indigenous perspectives and ways of knowing in policies that affect these communities. To improve outcomes and quality of data, it is imperative that Indigenous Peoples, including Elders as keepers of essential information, lead and collaborate on research projects to ensure relevance and cultural safety. The Yukon has 14 First Nations, with Indigenous peoples representing approximately 23% of Yukon's population. They experience proportionately more issues related to service access and population health outcomes than non-Indigenous people. Health research in the Yukon must focus on a strengths-based approach to support Indigenous self-determination in research. It must also be led by communities. Yukon's Strategy for Patient Oriented Research unit is supporting how people with lived experience and communities can support health research to inform policies and program delivery, ultimately improving health outcomes for all people in the Yukon."
Tailoring and Sharing Anti-bullying Resources with Indigenous Communities,"['Leadbeater, Bonnie J']",['N/A'],"['Bullying Prevention', 'Communty Collaborations', 'Going To Scale', 'Health Promotion']",11201.0,308105,"Being a chronic victim of bullying is a well-known precursor to mental health problems and to youth suicides. These are among the priority concerns of the Institute for Aboriginal Health and community-relevant prevention strategies are needed to improve these concerns. However, inequities in access to programs and resources that have been developed to support community- and school-based health promotion are stark in rural and remote First Nations, Metis and Inuit communities. Indeed, efforts to implement programs that show the ability to improve outcomes for children and youth face serious challenges. Indigenous communities, in particular, require opportunities and often support to adapt resources - which are typically developed in university-community collaborations in urban settings - to local traditions, values, needs and service capacity. The proposed dissemination meeting 1) will review the evidence-based WITS Programs resources (www.witsprogram.ca) designed to create responsive communities for the prevention of bullying and peer victimization and 2) will evaluate the Programs relevance for First Nations communities in British Columbia. Outcomes of this meeting will be recommendations for points of adaptation that enhance cultural relevance and take account of service delivery capacity of Aboriginal communities while retaining essential principals and kernels of action of this evidenced-based program. The meeting is proposed by a well-established  partnership: The WITS Program Partnership received the 2013 CIHR Partnership Award for its extensive dissemination work in also collaboration with the RCMP, Red Cross, the PREVNET National Center for Excellence, the Rock Solid Foundation (a not for profit group) and more than 500 schools and communities across Canada.  We will be joined in the proposed meeting by leaders from the RCMP and Indigenous communities across BC. Each has been or will be locally identified as key representatives of their communities."

However, research shows that this age group is at higher risk than either adolescents (under age 18) or adults (over age 29) for substance abuse, suicide, deaths due to injuries and homicides, and relationship violence. Youth transitioning into young adulthood across the recent period of economic downturn are being described by the media as the ""lost generation"" who are ""mired in debt and working in dead end jobs"" and deferring long term relationships and child rearing (see DOC ZONE's Generation Jobless). Yet, there is little empirical research on the predictors of health, healthy life styles, and social determinants of health in Canadian young adults. Research informed guidelines for preventive health care are not available for this age group, and access to medical care by a regular family doctor is limited. The proposed study of predictors of young adult health trajectories builds on five waves of data from the Victoria Healthy Youth Survey (V-HYS), collected every two years (2003 to 2011) from 664 Canadian youth (ages 12 to 18 in 2003). Our past V-HYS research focused on whether and how adolescents' characteristics and experiences influence differences in health trajectories in emerging adulthood (the early twenties). Our findings show that injuries, self-harm, alcohol and substance use, dating violence, bullying, and mental illnesses in adolescence affect health, education, and romantic relationships do have consequences for their health and well-being as young adults. In this next phase of our research, we contribute to a much needed understanding of the determinants of health outcomes in young adulthood (the late twenties) when the majority of our sample is leaving school, entering the labour market, and making lasting decisions about social support networks, romantic relationships, family formation, and life styles."

The experiential exercise is a 30-minute simulated walk-through of a series of colonial historical events that have impacted Indigenous peoples in Canada.  The exercise engages participants in reflecting on their own experience in order to build empathy, understanding, and mutual respect, and encourages participants towards transformation and social action.

The experiential exercise is followed by 60 minutes of reflection, deconstruction and discussion of the exercise. Discussion topics include:
Identity: deconstructing racism, stereotypes and their impacts on health and well-being.
Greif and Loss: Inter/trans-generational impacts of trauma
Impacts of colonialism: power/powerlessness
Indigeneity: resistance; reclaim, restore, revive and thrive; empowerment.
Reconciliation: moving forward together to improve the health and well-being of all.

Applicability of the exercise:
-Builds personal intercultural understanding that can be applied when working with Indigenous populations in Canada.
-Transforms misconceptions/misunderstanding towards empathy and mutual respect, which can be applied to Culturally Safe Care.
-A lesson plan will be provided to all participants for those interested in conducting this exercise in their classrooms or institutions."

As such, the proposed research with the COMPASS system I have developed is highly relevant to evaluating numerous interventions and informing policy and practice in partnership with multiple different stakeholders. The anticipated outcomes from the program of research proposed here are designed to improve youth health in Canada by maximizing the use of existing COMPASS data and building new research and practice capacity that leverages my existing COMPASS resources to: address numerous applied public health questions (at multiple levels of influence, on multiple topic domains, that are relevant to numerous stakeholders); build the foundation for mentoring trainees and new investigators in the COMPASS model of applied systems thinking; strengthen national capacity required to Plan, Act, Evaluate and Adapt strategies to
advance youth health in multiple domains; strengthen our ability to understand and address health inequities among high-risk groups; expand our ability to understand how different social and physical environments shape youth health trajectories or the outcomes of different programs and policies; and, foster more evidence-based practice through engaged partnerships between researchers and knowledge users. The scope of my program of research is clearly focused on generating practice-based evidence to advance youth health, and the breadth of my research program makes it relevant to multiple research areas of interest outlined for this CIHR funding opportunity."

In the 2013 Ontario Student Drug Use and Health Survey (OSDUHS), poor mental health was reported by 15% of students, and 26% reported psychological distress with 13% seriously considering suicide (1). Prevention and early intervention, as well as the promotion of resiliency, are considered key priorities to ensure positive mental health among youth. Schools represent ideal settings for these initiatives, yet we know very little about how to effectively intervene. The COMPASS system was designed to evaluate and improve youth prevention research and practice in school settings overtime (2). COMPASS currently addresses substance use (tobacco, alcohol, marijuana), obesity prevention (diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour), and bullying. In the most recent wave of the COMPASS data collection, we identified that 62% of participating schools ranked mental health as their school's top prevention priority. The current study aims to address this gap by developing and testing a mental health module for inclusion in the COMPASS study. The module will include a student questionnaire, a tool for assessing relevant school programs and policies, and a tool to provide feedback to each school on the mental health of their students and potential strategies for addressing any concerns. After consultations with experts, students, and school staff, the modules will be tested in a sample of schools currently involved with COMPASS to ensure they satisfactorily capture key aspects of youth mental health and school strategies and resources in an appropriate and comprehensive manner. At completion, the module will be incorporated in the existing COMPASS infrastructure helping to guide future youth prevention research and practice related to mental health."

COMPASS data can be used as large repeat cross sectional surveys or as a linked longitudinal data set. We will use quasi-experimental pre-post designs using both the repeat cross sectional data and longitudinal data to explore how cannabis policies impact the following outcomes over time: frequency of cannabis use, modes of cannabis consumption, age of cannabis onset, ease of accessing cannabis, and cannabis impaired driving. 

We will explore how policies at various levels of influence may impact the various cannabis outcomes among youth over time. This includes the following:
1) What is the impact of cannabis legalization nationally on youth over time (pre-post legalization)? 
2) Do the different cannabis distribution policies across the participating COMPASS provinces impact youth cannabis use, and does the impact change over time as modes of distribution change provincially over time?
3) What is the impact that school-specific cannabis prevention policies have on youth cannabis use over time? 
4) Does the impact pf a policy (at any level) vary among subpopulations of youth (e.g., ethnicity, urban/rural/suburban, among smokers/drinkers)?
5) Do changes in cannabis youth result in changes in mental health indicators and/or poly substance use over time?"

En postulant la pertinence de l'approche des capabilités (AC) pour soutenir cette réflexion, cette présentation vise à proposer une conception renouvelée de la pratique professionnelle en fin de vie. Méthodologie: Au travers d'une histoire de cas inspirée d'une pratique infirmière, une proposition de pratique de santé, théorisée par l'AC sera effectuée. L'AC, développée par Sen a comme objectif de centraliser l'action autour du développement des possibilités et les libertés individuelles pour permettre à la personne de vivre la vie souhaitée. L'AC permet de réfléchir la pratique professionnelle autour de la mobilisation des ressources de l'individu et de l'environnement. Résultats: Cette histoire de cas proposera, au travers de l'AC, une perspective salutogénique de la pratique professionnelle en fin de vie en réfléchissant le soin en soutien à ce que les individus sont capable de faire et d'être. Cette proposition théorique, par la mise en relation des dimensions individuelles, sociales et environnementales qui constituent la pratique, met de l'avant un agir intersubjectif dans une finalité de promotion de la santé.

Nevertheless, many disadvantaged groups, (e.g., low-income, minorities) face barriers to eating well and exercising. From a health prevention perspective, it is vital to understand and to address the interplay between social, cultural, political, and economic factors that affect health practices. The proposed project involves an evaluation of the Good Food Box (GFB), a community-based program designed to provide low cost, high quality fruits and vegetables. A two-step evaluation framework is used. The first phase is a needs assessment of the barriers and facilitators to the uptake of the GFB by urban Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal low-income households. In-depth semi-structured interviews will be conducted to identify economic, social, cultural, structural and individual factors that limit participation in the GFB program. Photovoice will be used to illustrate community concerns and to inform the needs assessment. This contextual approach will assist in the development of recommendations and strategies that target at-risk urban Canadians. An intervention program which targets the barriers and facilitators of participation in the GFB fruits and vegetables program will be developed in Phase II of the project. Overall, the objective of this study is to evaluate whether participation in the GFB program increases fruit and vegetable consumption and whether this can result in other diet-related improvements and better health outcomes. We will also formatively evaluate the process of implementation in order to identify the components that worked best to achieve the objectives and why. Recommendations will address the gaps in social and community service provision and needed changes at the policy level to reduce health inequality."

Human papillomavirus (HPV) is an often symptomless, sexually transmitted infection that causes most cervical cancers. This cancer can be prevented through HPV vaccination, regular Papanicolaou (Pap) tests that can detect precancerous cells and the HPV test that screens for the virus. While these tools' access have increased, Black women and people with a cervix (Black WPC) experience screening barriers and have lower screening rates than White populations, increasing their risk of cancer mortality. 
HPV self-sampling (HPVSS), could increase screening rates and address some barriers by empowering Black WPC to self-sample. International literature shows HPVSS is accurate and favorably viewed by most women. 
Black WPC HPVSS research is lacking despite a federal action plan to eliminate cervical cancer by 2040 and implement HPVSS by 2030. With implementation near, proactively learning how to engage Black WPC to ensure they are knowledgeable about and are empowered to HPVSS is vital for a successful, HPV testing program.  
I propose a two-phased, community-informed study in Peel region-a microcosm of Ontario with a large Black population-to co-develop and pilot test an HPVSS intervention tailored for Black WPC. I will use intersectionality to help explore ways participants' identities (e.g., race, gender) and societal factors inform their view of cervical cancer screening, HPV and HPVSS in healthcare systems. Phase 1 will qualitatively collect 40 Black WPC and 10 health care providers' HPV knowledge, and HPVSS beliefs, motivations, barriers and facilitators via one-on-one semi-structured interviews created with community research assistants (CRAs) and health centres. Results will inform phase 2-pilot testing a CRA led intervention informed by the transtheoretical model with 50 Black WPC that seeks to increase their cervical cancer, HPV knowledge and HPVSS uptake."

The Canadian government recently introduced regulations that will require front-of-pack warning labels that can help consumers easily identify foods high in nutrients to limit: total sugars, saturated fat, and sodium. My research will look at how these warning labels can help individuals at high risk for type 2 diabetes grocery shop for healthy foods. First, I will use a packaged food database to identify foods that will carry the warning labels and foods that are not consistent with the guidelines for individuals at high risk for diabetes. By comparing these two categories of foods, I can see how the front-of-pack warning labels match the dietary guidelines for individuals at high risk for diabetes. Second, I will assess if a mobile app with warning labels can help consumers make decisions about which foods to buy while grocery shopping. Researchers in my training lab have developed a mobile app called FoopFlip© that shows the Nutrition Facts table and warning labels with healthier alternatives when users scan barcodes of foods or search foods by name. In this study, participants will be randomized to see different features of the App (Nutrition Facts table only or all the features) or not receive any App. I will look at purchased groceries for 6 weeks to see how the information on the App helped participants make healthy food choices. I will also send an online survey to participants to see how the App affected their nutritional knowledge and purchasing behaviours. My research will show whether user-friendly mobile apps can be developed to help Canadians make healthier food choices and change purchasing behaviours in relation to their health conditions."
Dishonesty in Children with Severe Conduct Problems,"['Lee, Kang']","['Augimeri, Leena K']","['Conduct Disorder', 'Dishonesty', 'Lying', 'Severe Conduct Problems']",525013.0,281620,"Conduct disorder is one of the most commonly diagnosed conditions in child mental health centers in North America. While some children already meet clinical diagnostic criteria for Conduct Disorder before the age of 10, many display severe, yet subclinical, symptoms such as fighting, shoplifting, and lying that are yet to meet criteria. Left untreated in early childhood, these early conduct problems place the child at risk for developing full blown Conduct Disorder later on. The limited existing evidence regarding lying in children with conduct problems comes primarily from hearsay reports. The current research program will address this significant gap by using experimental methods to systematically investigate lying behaviors of children with severe conduct problems. We will capitalize on both our unprecedented access to a large population of children between the ages of 6 and 10 with severe conduct problems and our unique expertise and extensive knowledge of the development of lie-telling. In contrast to previous studies that have treated lying as a unitary behavior, we will examine how children with conduct problems lie for prosocial and antisocial purposes, and establish whether and how their lies differ from those of typically developing children. We will also investigate verbal and nonverbal cues associated with children's deception as well as cognitive and social factors affecting pro- and anti-social lying. We will test the hypothesis that children with conduct problems will display a developmental trajectory opposite from that of typically developing children, displaying more antisocial lies and fewer prosocial lies with increased age. Results from this five-year, large scale study will greatly enhance understanding of the development of lying in children with conduct problems, provide new insights regarding their honesty-dishonesty profiles, and help develop more comprehensive assessment and intervention tools for children with conduct problems."
Corporate influences on declining global public health indicators?  An interdisciplinary approach to developing comparative methodology and analyses of the causal links between corporate praxes and non-communicable diseases,"['Lee, Kelley']","['Erikson, Susan L']","['Corporations', 'Global Health', 'Health Indicators', 'Health Policy', 'Non-Communicable Diseases', 'Risk Factors']",21000.0,273156,"Over the last 50 years, average measures of health and wellness - known in public health circles as ""indicators"" - have steadily improved around the world. Recent evidence of a decline in one of the most reliable health indicators, life expectancy, is emerging. The decline is attributed to the rise of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like diabetes, cancers and heart disease. The increase of these diseases has been largely attributed to lifestyle and environment, and is observed across almost all countries, as well as all racial/ethnic and socioeconomic groups, suggesting a problem of global magnitude. The proposed meeting will support a network of collaboration among researchers analysing corporate activities as they relate to NCDs worldwide. Over the last 30 years, there have been profound changes to the global economy and finance, namely the growth of corporations in the production of health-related goods and services. Corporations are not uniform in their forms and operations, and not all corporate activity results in negative impacts on public health. Research is urgently needed about how corporations operate in specific locations and globally; what similarities and differences in forms and operations exist across industries; and what types of corporations and what specific corporate activities increase the risk factors for NCDs. Where there are adverse health impacts from how corporations operate, effective policy interventions depend on a fuller understanding of these causal relationships. Moreover, corporations influence policy making itself, supporting regulations that further non-health goals. What do public health practitioners and regulators need to know about corporate involvement in policy-making? The proposed meeting supports a new research network that links projects across 8 institutions in six countries. The network will enable comparative analysis and new methodologies that will answer these key questions."

In response, jurisdictions and global organizations are committing to transforming food systems to promote healthy, sustainable, and equitable diets. To support a food system transformation, comprehensive and routine surveillance data that monitors health, climate, and equity impacts will be important for informing policy and programming decisions. Since food and nutrition data intersects with multiple disciplines, such as health and agriculture, collaboration across disciplines and sectors is also needed to ensure policy- and decision-making has benefits for both health and the planet. However, in Canada, food and nutrition surveillance activities are currently disjointed across sectors and disciplines and primarily focused on only health monitoring. The objective of this research is to strengthen food and nutrition surveillance in Canada by improving collaboration and data structures for monitoring health, climate, and equity. To understand how food and nutrition surveillance is conducted in Canada, a network analysis will be conducted to examine the system of people, groups, and organizations involved and their relationships. This network will then be engaged in interviews and a document review to assess facilitators, barriers, and opportunities for collaboration in food and nutrition surveillance and potential data gaps in monitoring health, climate, and equity impacts. Using evidence from the interviews and review, a series of design thinking workshops will be conducted with the network to develop strategies for greater collaboration across sectors and disciplines and for improving monitoring data in Canada. To ultimately support the health of Canadians and the planet, this work will shed light on opportunities to improve food and nutrition surveillance to better inform policy and programming decisions for health, climate, and equity."

Evidence shows that changes in lifestyle can reduce pain and enhance quality of life for people with MSK diseases. Programmes to support MSK patients to manage their disease by making lifestyle changes (e.g. increased physical activity) are often too standardized to meet the needs of patients in different contexts. Digital technologies offer great versatility in offering support when and where it is needed by patients. If we are to maximize the potential of digital technologies to support patients in improving their health, more research is needed to improve the user-friendliness of digital tools available. A necessary next step is to gain in-depth insight into the perspectives of MSK patients on the barriers and facilitators specific to the contexts in which they use digital technologies to manage their disease. My study has 3 objectives: 1) to understand MSK patients' perspectives on how they manage their disease; 2) to investigate MSK patients' views and experiences of using digital technologies in managing their disease; 3) to compare and contrast experiences of MSK patients using digital technologies to manage their disease in multiple contexts across Canada. To achieve these objectives, I will 1) analyze data collected from 21 MSK patients to identify salient themes in their experiences of managing their disease; 2) hold 6-7 focus groups with MSK patients in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta to develop understanding of a range of perspectives of using digital technologies in managing MSK diseases; 3) hold interviews with 36 patients with 3 common types of MSK disease following their use of a digital media intervention designed to support improvement in their management of their disease. Findings can provide recommendations on how digital technologies can be used to offer meaningful support for patients' management of MSK diseases."
Patient Engagement in Research at the Canadian Cancer Society: Incorporating a Relational Ethics Lens,"['Leese, Jennifer']",['N/A'],"['Cancer', 'Ethics', 'Patient Engagement In Research', 'Qualitative']",108500.0,465781,"The Canadian Cancer Society (CCS) is the largest national charitable funder of cancer research in Canada. With a mandate to improve the health of people living with cancer in all communities across Canada, the CCS is a leading pioneer of patient engagement in research that advances scientific knowledge, government policy and healthcare services in cancer care. Patient engagement occurs when individuals with personal experience of a health issue or informal caregivers (including family and friends) are meaningfully involved in the process of research. It has the potential to keep research relevant and reduce the time gap between research results and their use in the real world. 

In continuing to advance patient engagement in cancer research, decision-makers at the CCS have expressed interests to study varied experiences of patient engagement in key areas, to help inform future planning, decision-making and ongoing commitment to quality improvement. These key areas include strategic planning and governance, implementation of policies and programs, the design and review of funding opportunities (including new grant competitions targeting high fatality cancers and addressing equity in cancer control) and knowledge dissemination. The aim of the proposed program of work is therefore to better understand how engagement works between patient partners and other stakeholders in these key areas at the CCS, and the impacts (positive and negative) that may be experienced.

Knowledge created will provide a basis for actions to support further growth of beneficial practices in patient engagement at the CCS and may prove useful to other funders, researchers, and patient partners engaging in cancer research. It will also align well with the mandates of CIHR-IHSPR and CIHR-ICR, as well as the vision and patient engagement and capacity development frameworks of SPOR."

En effet, des études suggèrent que l'apnée obstructive du sommeil pourrait accélérer des processus de neurodégénérescence. Les études à venir devraient se pencher sur l'identification des facteurs de risque de l'apnée obstructive du sommeil ainsi que des personnes âgées qui en souffrent et qui sont à plus haut risque de démence.

La recherche que j'effectue vise à amener de nouveaux éléments de réponse à ces questions encore peu explorées.

J'explore notamment l'association entre l'âge, le sexe, la génétique et les problèmes de santé tels que l'hypertension, le diabète et l'obésité avec différentes fonctions cognitives. Les projets sur lesquels je travaille portent sur des grandes cohortes provenant de différents milieux de vie, ce qui amène une diversité intéressante aux échantillons étudiés. De plus, une batterie de tests neuropsychologiques exhaustive a été administrée, maximisant ainsi la variété de variables cognitives pouvant être étudiées. Si certaines de ces variables cognitives pouvaient mettre en lumière les personnes les plus à risque de déclin cognitif en lien avec l'apnée obstructive du sommeil, nous pourrions intervenir auprès de ces personnes et potentiellement réduire leur risque de démence."

Toxic stress undermines parent-child relationship quality (including attachment) and puts children at risk for cognitive and motor developmental challenges, and health problems including alterations in immune function. Parents' reflective function (RF), i.e. capacity to understand their own and their child's mental states, can strengthen parent-child relationships, and buffer the impacts of toxic stress on children. We have developed and tested an intervention program called ATTACH for parents exposed to toxic stress and their vulnerable preschool-aged children, focusing on improving parents' RF. In extensive pilot work, we found the intervention not only improved RF, but also parent-child relationship quality and attachment, as well as children's cognitive and motor development. We recently adapted the program based on community partner feedback and developed a prototype e-learning platform to more rapidly train health care professionals to implement ATTACH. Using integrated knowledge transfer approaches, we will conduct an effectiveness-implementation hybrid study of ATTACH to evaluate real-world implementation: 1a) impacts on parent-child relationship quality (primary outcome), parental RF, and child development (cognitive and motor), 1b) for whom it works best/worst, 1c) impacts on immune biomarkers of inflammatory disease risk, 1d) health professionals' adherence to ATTACH program and (1e) longer-term impacts.

Described as a ""ticking time bomb"", youth mental health problems have negative consequences for lifelong dysfunction affecting educational achievement, relationship success, work attainment and income. COVID-19 stressors may impact youth mental health by 'getting under the skin' and becoming engrained in child biology. To test this hypothesis, we propose quantifying an epigenetic mark called DNA methylation from child cheek swabs collected serendipitously just prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic for comparison with samples we propose to collect approximately 2 years later. Our analysis first involves the creation of a pandemic stress score representing how much stress each child faced by combining stress measures from child and parent reports at the level of the youth (e.g., infection risks to child and friends), family (e.g., parental conflict), and community (loss of in-person schooling) and validating those scores with concurrent assessments of child mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety). Second, we will test whether pandemic stress scores relate to shifts in biological DNA methylation patterns pre- to 2 years post-pandemic onset, and whether shifts relate to youth mental health outcomes 2 years post-pandemic onset. We will also test whether pandemic stress is related to 'biological age', a DNA methylation-based gauge of biological aging that is relevant for long-term health outcomes. We will do each analysis separately for males and females to identify sex-specific stress pathways, given literature showing sex differences in both stress experiences and mental health outcomes. Findings will inform how pandemic stress from economic strain and social restrictions gets under the skin to affect youth mental health and what biological factors put some children at greater risk than others for mental health consequences."

The symptoms of depression cause considerable suffering, with negative lifespan impacts on education, marital success, work attainment, and income. Depression costs the Canadian economy approximately $32 billion/year. In contrast, resilience is the ability to respond positively and adapt to adversity; higher resilience is linked with optimal mental health among youth. Both depression and resilience likely result from an interplay between genes and experiences in early life. Epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation (DNAm), have been linked to depression and resilience. Mental health experts recommend research focus on understanding resilience to help address the problem of youth depression. This has not been done due to lack of a) longitudinal studies, and b) statistical methods to handle large volumes of data. Identifying early life risk and protective factors for youths' depression or resilience, and the role of DNAm, could guide better prevention and treatment for youth mental health promotion, or even suggest targets for pharmacotherapy. 

Since 2009, the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON) Team has collected longitudinal data on 2000+ families since pregnancy. We will use new machine learning techniques to explore how patterns of DNAm may link comprehensive prenatal, infancy, preschool and school-age risk and protective factors to depression and resilience in APrON 15 year-olds. To do this, we will collect buccal (cheek cell) samples from 15 year-olds for assessment of DNAm. We will also measure youth depression and resilience at 15 years of age.

It is important to know exactly how much time a child spends being active or inactive. That way if they're not getting enough activity, we can help them to move more. One way to measure physical activity is using accelerometers, a type of movement sensor. In older children, accelerometers can help us monitor exactly how much time they spend doing really easy activities and activities that get their hearts pumping. Yet, very little research uses accelerometers with toddlers, or children between the ages of 12 to 35 months. The goal of my research on the iPLAY study is to figure out if and how we can use accelerometers to measure physical activity in toddlers. To do this, we video recorded toddlers doing different activities while wearing an accelerometer. I will compare each second of the video to the accelerometer and see how well they match. By figuring this out, we can create instructions for other researchers who are also measuring physical activity in young children. The other goal of my study is to figure out how much Canadian toddlers move. To do this, we also had toddlers wear the accelerometers at home for one week. Using the instructions I made from the first goal, I will see how much toddlers normally move. I will also try to figure out why some toddlers move more than others. This is important because once we can measure how active they are, we can study how much activity can help to make sure toddlers are growing up as healthy as possible."

People experiencing homelessness have high rates of morbidity and mortality, resulting in a life expectancy of 42 years for men, and 52 years for women. Stigma, trauma and discrimination contribute to marginalization of people who are homeless, particularly indigenous peoples, women, LGBTQI2S and racialized groups.

The Evidence Based Clinical Guidelines for Homeless, Vulnerably Housed and People with Lived Homelessness Experience provide broad recommendations to support people experiencing homelessness with access to healthcare and housing. Because homelessness is a key health equity issue for the public health community, we utilize a prominent framework to examine public health roles as they pertain to the recent Evidence-Based Guidelines.

Using the National Collaborating Center for Determinants of Health (NCCDH) framework ""Public Health Roles for Improving Health Equity"", we examine ways that public health is already and can further respond to homelessness including (1) assessing and reporting on inequities relating to homelessness, (2) modifying and orienting interventions to better serve this population, (3) partnering with other sectors and (4) participating in policy development.  We use familiar public health examples including tuberculosis management, opioid strategy and adverse childhood experiences, to explore in detail how homelessness can be more effectively addressed by public health organizations.

Application of these guidelines through this framework demonstrates how public health can act on this preventable cause of morbidity and mortality. We discuss how existing activities in public health are relevant to meeting this population's needs, and identify opportunities for public health to reduce barriers for homeless populations, and address determinants of poor health related to homelessness through program, organizational, and policy-level interventions."

Some of the burnt building materials included pressure-treated wood that was preserved with chromated copper arsenate (CCA). Burning of the CCA-treated wood left high concentrations of arsenic and a number of metals in the ash. Combustion of organic materials and debris also produced chemical contaminants, such as mixtures of polycyclic aromatic compounds. During the fires, fine particulates were suspended in the air and detected not only in Fort McMurray but in surrounding Aboriginal communities such as Fort McKay and Anzac. Community members have concerns about how much of these chemical contaminants end up in the traditional foods that the local communities depend on. Traditional foods, such as locally hunted game meat and locally harvested plants, are essential to meeting the nutritional needs of First Nations communities and are a central component of cultural identity. This project is developed in collaboration with the wildfire-affected Northern Alberta communities, such as the Mikisew Cree First Nation (Fort Chipewyan), Fort McKay First Nation and Metis locals. A primary objective is to measure and compare the levels of important contaminants in local game meat and plants collected before and after the Alberta wildfires. The collaborating First Nations communities and researchers of this project already have archived traditional food samples from a 10-year First Nations Food Nutrition and Environment Study. This new project builds on this collaborative dynamic and a partnership with community members to address immediate concerns over the safety of their local foods. The collaborative team consists of knowledge users, decision makers, a disaster medicine expert, and researchers with complementary expertise.The results of this study will empower community members to make evidence-based decisions on traditional food safety immediately after the wildfires."

To examine this hypothesis, we will conduct a series of qualitative interviews focusing on gender role conflict and suicidal behavior and will analyze these interviews using modified grounded theory. 

According to the 2006 Census, approximately half of the population in the metropolitan Toronto area is foreign born, with over one million residents born in Asia and the Middle East. 10.4% of the population of the GTA identifies as ethnically Chinese (Statscan, 2006). Recent studies have highlighted themes of gender role stress in Chinese born women and Women of Chinese descent residing in North America who have experienced suicidal ideation and behaviour, including conflict between traditional and Western female roles (Chung, 2003). By examining gender role stress in both China and Canada, we can work to better identify and meet the needs of Chinese-Canadian women who are at risk for suicide.  We can work to develop culturally appropriate mental health interventions to reduce the risk of suicidal behaviour and improve the quality of life for women experiencing gender role stress. This process can also provide a framework for examining and developing culturally sensitive suicide prevention strategies for at-risk Canadians."

Today food insecurity in Nunavut is the highest in Canada at four times the national average. The Aqqiumavvik Society in Arviat, Nunavut addresses community food insecurity by encouraging local harvesting and consumption of abundant, nutrient-rich wild foods. Arviat is a seasonal nesting ground to an overly large population of light geese (Snow and Ross's Geese); an important food resource that is underutilized. 

Arviarmiut (people of Arviat) want to know if their goose population is safe to consume, and to understand what level of increased community harvest of geese and eggs is sustainable. To address these questions, our project will monitor light goose population, distribution, and health according to community-relevant metrics. Arviat young hunters will be trained to lead the monitoring, supporting Inuit self-determination in research and addressing continuity challenges in federal monitoring programs. We will also investigate community goose consumption preferences and nutritional implications. Community-led monitoring provides the foundation to assess the impacts of climate change on Arctic nesting geese and their habitat over time. 

The Aqqiumavvik Society has brought together a diverse and dedicated team of community, academic, and government researchers with expertise in Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (IQ; Inuit knowledge and values), community health, epidemiology, Inuit food systems, goose biology, population dynamics, and ecotoxicology. We will investigate the interplay between human and goose population health, climatic change, migratory bird policy, and food security using the Aajiiqatigiingniq Research Methodology to build consensus and seek solutions. Ultimately, this project aims to promote renewed community harvests and consumption of light geese that can contribute to restoring Inuit food sovereignty."

In Arviat, Nunavut, the Aqqiumavvik Society addresses issues around community food insecurity, primarily by encouraging harvesting and consumption of nutrient-rich country foods. Aqqiumavvik's work is grounded in the holistic worldview of Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (Inuit knowledge and values; IQ) and their associated community-developed research model. Guided by Aqqiumavvik, our diverse team will work together to investigate the potential for a coordinated community harvest of light geese to enhance food sovereignty in Arviat. 

 

Currently, a large population of light geese (Snow and Ross's Geese) migrates to nest around Arviat in spring and summer. Harvesting spring geese had long been an important seasonal contribution to food security in the region, until the 1910s when legislation banning goose harvesting disrupted Inuit knowledge, practices, and food systems. Although Arviarmiut (people of Arviat) are now actively harvesting spring geese again, Inuit understandings of - and relationships with - light geese have suffered. Arviarmiut recently recommended establishing a coordinated community goose harvest to contribute to community food sovereignty. This proposed harvest aims to address the overabundance of geese in the region while maintaining harmonious and respectful relationships with all forms of life. The goal of our Team Grant is to investigate the viability of such a harvest in the context of climate change. We will connect IQ and scientific ways of knowing in considering the interplay between human and goose population health, climatic change, migratory bird policy, and Inuit food sovereignty."

Physical Literacy is conceived to be the tools, social/cognitive, behavioural, and fitness related, that children need to possess or develop in order to receive the inherent health benefits of taking part in physical activity for life-long health, enjoyment and success. Although physical education is considered to be an integral part of the education of all children, the quality, quantity, and curricular outcomes of physical education are currently not adequately evaluated and the consequently there is no accountability for the obesity crisis in Canada. The objective of this 1-year grant is to create and validate a comprehensive measure of physical literacy on children ages 10-12 years and will be pilot tested in eastern Ontario for feasibility, reliability and validity. The Canadian Assessment of Physical Literacy (CAPL) will assess physical fitness, physical activity, fundamental movement skills and psycho-social knowledge about activity. Three versions of the CAPL will be created in order to determine the most comprehensive, yet feasible, time conscious, with the optimum amount of financial and staff involvement. During this start up grant we are proposing 3 cycles of testing. During Cycle 1 each version will be tested on 75 children. Based on the results and feedback the modules will be modified. In Cycle 2 each version will be tested on another 75 children to evaluate the effectiveness of the modified modules; further minor modifications will be made and in Cycle 3, each version will be tested on approximately 200 children where normative data and trends will be gathered. In Cycle 3 test-re-test, and inter-rater reliability will also be measured. The information gathered will inform parents, teachers, health professionals and researchers about the current status of childhood physical literacy in Canadian children."

Recently, neuroscience researchers identified biomarkers that they believe reflect suicide risk acquired over the life course as a result of specific negative experiences. These experiences include child abuse, which is thought to lead to measurable neurobiological changes that have durable and tangible effects. Researchers argue that these ""embodied"" forms of vulnerability are associated with the development of personality traits directly related to increased risk of suicidal behaviour. In this project we ask: what understandings of suicide risk are emerging in specific forms of scientific and psychiatric research? How do emerging notions of vulnerability overlap or not? We will examine the extent to which studies of biomarkers for suicide risk might change people's understandings of choice, risk, and volition as well as beliefs about appropriate management of suicide risk if it comes to be understood as ""in the brain"". Drawing on a unique, long-term engagement with a team of clinical and molecular researchers, this project traces intersecting notions of psychiatric vulnerability within the fields of developmental research, neuroscience, and environmental epigenetics. Based on qualitative interviews and ethnographic research, this empirically grounded study focuses on three intersections: (1) of the lab and the clinic, (2) of epigenetics and neuroanatomical studies, and (3) of prospective cohort studies and retrospectively produced models of neuropsychiatric risk. This project will offer a clarifying role of the specific nature of risk emerging at each of these intersections along with the implications of these risk models for addressing psychiatric conditions and suffering in the 21st century, at the crossroads of different sciences, experiences of suffering, and health care."

We then developed BETTER HEALTH (Building on Existing Tools to Improve Chronic Disease Prevention and Screening in Public Health) , by adapting BETTER to a public health setting to improve participation in chronic disease prevention and screening actions by adults 40-64 years living with low income.

The proposed study will adapt the BETTER HEALTH intervention to adults ages 18-39 years living with low income.

The increased rate of HIV infection among women in Canada highlights the importance of understanding the social determinants of health among women. HIV-related stigma and discrimination interacts with structural inequities and may be exacerbated for marginalized populations such as ethno-racial minorities. Despite the continued increase in infections among women, particularly within marginalized communities, there remains a need for research on HIV-related stigma with HIV-positive women in Canada. The objective of my proposed research is to understand how stigma and discrimination operate as social determinants of health for women living with HIV in Ontario. 
Methods
Working as a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Women's College Research Institute, I will expand upon the CIHR-funded multi-method research project ""Involving Ontario HIV-Positive Women and Their Providers in Determining Their Research Needs and Priorities"" (PIs: Dr. Mona Loutfy, Wangari Tharao). My analyses will enhance understanding of stigma and discrimination as social determinants of health, quality of life and access to care for HIV-positive women. 
In the first year, I will conduct qualitative analyses to examine three aspects of stigma and discrimination (violence against women, HIV-related stigma, sexual stigma) as social determinants of health and quality of life for HIV-positive women in Ontario. During the second year, I will conduct quantitative analyses to examine the impact of three types of stigma and discrimination (HIV-related stigma, gender-based discrimination, racism) on health, quality of life and access to care for HIV-positive African Caribbean women.
Outcomes
Outputs will include: a) peer-reviewed abstracts and manuscripts and b) grant proposals for the development of: i) evidence-based interventions to challenge stigma and discrimination, ii) treatment, care and support guidelines for HIV-positive women, iii) policy briefs to promote health equity."

In the Northwest Territories (NWT) rates of sexually transmitted infections (STI) are disproportionately high among young people, with reported STI rates ten times the national average. High STI rates are a risk factor for HIV transmission, and yet recorded HIV rates in NWT are consistent with the rest of Canada. This may be due to low testing rates and under-reporting resulting from geographic isolation, stigma and lack of health care access. These challenges may be exacerbated for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) youth, who have higher HIV/STI infection rates in comparison with heterosexual youth in other regions of Canada. However no information exists on HIV/STI among LGBTQ+ youth in NWT. 

This 1 year study aims to establish an interdisciplinary team of LGBTQ+ Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal youth, adults and allies to generate knowledge of social contexts of HIV and STI vulnerability among LGBTQ+ youth in NWT.

Phase 1: Key informant (KI) interviews (n=6) with LGBTQ+ youth, community members, advocates and service providers in NWT to explore experiences of stigma, resilience, and HIV/STI vulnerabilities among LGBTQ+ youth in NWT.  Phase 2: Body-mapping workshops with LGBTQ+ youth in Yellowknife (n=10) and Hay River (n=5) where participants will a) create body maps in a group setting and b) share body map narratives in in-depth individual interviews. Body mapping has the potential to reveal embodied experiences and contexts of sexual health among LGBTQ+ youth in the NWT.  Phase 3: Participatory action research to engage community stakeholders in knowledge translation and exchange, including an LGBTQ+ youth forum and art exhibit at NWT Pride 2015. Knowledge generated from KI interviews, body-mapping workshops and knowledge mobilization activities will inform a 2015 CIHR CBR Grant application."

Forcibly displaced persons include refugees who are granted protection in another country. HIV risks among displaced persons and refugees are elevated due to poverty, breakdown of social structures, increased sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) in conflict and refugee settlements, and limited access to HIV prevention tools. People living with HIV (PLHIV) in refugee settlements can experience HIV treatment disruptions due to limited health resources. There is a need for tailored interventions to meet the priorities of refugees. 

Uganda, in East Africa, currently hosts over 1 million refugees. Two-thirds of Uganda's refugees at the end of 2016 were from South Sudan-triple the rate from 1-year prior. Bidi Bidi refugee settlement in Yumbe, Northern Uganda is estimated to be the second largest refugee settlement in the world-with over 265,000 refugees. HIV prevention challenges facing new refugees in Uganda include: low HIV knowledge; stigma as a barrier to HIV prevention and care; and low HIV testing rates. There are knowledge gaps regarding what are effective HIV prevention and care interventions in humanitarian settings.

This grant will support a planning meeting in Yumbe to facilitate international collaboration with key stakeholders (HIV clinicians, refugees, researchers, knowledge users) to identify HIV prevention and care research opportunities and priorities among newly displaced persons and refugees in Uganda to develop a future grant. We will first conduct an environmental scan of HIV prevention and care interventions in refugee settlements. We will then host a 2 day meeting to discuss: a) context specific HIV prevention/care needs and priorities, b) relevant HIV prevention/care programs for refugees in Northern Uganda, and c) viability of a research project and partnership focused on HIV prevention and care with refugees in Yumbe."

Uganda hosts 1 million refugees/displaced persons, and 98,000 live in Kampala, most in slums. Urban refugee/displaced adolescent girls have increased HIV risks due to poverty, violence, and limited healthcare. Yet we know little of HIV testing and prevention needs with displaced/refugee adolescent girls living in Kampala's slums. Our idea: We plan to develop, implement and evaluate an oral HIV-self testing (HIVST) intervention with displaced/refugee girls aged 15-19 in Kampala. HIVST is acceptable and properly used with adolescents in other SSA regions, yet we do not know the best way to link HIVST to HIV care. We explore how m-health (healthcare delivered on mobile-phones), congruent with how adolescents learn and socialize, can improve linkage to care with HIVST. Our Approach: Our 3-phase project involves: 1) working with refugee/displaced peer navigators to develop an m-health intervention (2-way supportive text messages; WhatsApp discussion groups); 2) implementing a cluster randomized trial with displaced/refugee girls aged 15-19 in 3 slums in Kampala (Arm 1: HIVST; Arm 2: HIVST + m-health; Arm 3: standard of care). We will assess changes in HIV testing, HIV status knowledge, and linkage to HIV care between the 3 arms. Phase 3 involves a process evaluation and participatory knowledge mobilization. Impact: We build on our CIHR planning grant that highlights the urgent need for HIV testing and prevention with urban refugee/displaced girls in Kampala. Findings will highlight optimal HIVST delivery approaches that can be expanded to other refugee/displaced adolescents in Uganda, SSA and humanitarian contexts."

There is an urgent need for tailored COVID-19 responses with refugee/displaced persons. We address knowledge gaps regarding COVID-19 prevention in humanitarian contexts. We focus on urban refugee/displaced youth in Uganda, where 1.4 million refugees are hosted-Sub-Saharan Africa's largest refugee hosting nation and the 3rd largest globally. Our study is located in Kampala, Uganda that hosts 90,000 urban refugee/displaced persons living in informal settlements. Adolescents and youth comprise half of the world's 70.8 million refugee/displaced persons yet are understudied in pandemics. OUR IDEA: We will develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a WhatsApp social group intervention in increasing COVID-19 prevention practices (hand and respiratory hygiene, physical distancing) among our existing CIHR Project Grant cohort of urban refugee/displaced youth aged 16-24 living in informal settlements in Kampala. Our project involves: 1) qualitative phone interviews with refugee/displaced youth (n=24) and key informants (n=6) to understand barriers and facilitators to COVID-19 prevention, following the RANAS (risk, attitude, norms, ability, self-regulation) approach to behaviour change; 2) integration of the qualitative findings to develop Kukaa Salama (Staying Safe), a 16-week COVID-19 prevention intervention (weekly SMS and moderated WhatsApp discussions); 3) conducting a single arm, pre-test/post-test trial to test the effectiveness of Kukaa Salama in improving COVID-19 prevention with refugee/displaced youth aged 16-24 (n=340); 4) knowledge mobilization, including a think tank to produce a refugee policy analysis. Findings will advance the COVID-19 global response with new knowledge of mHealth approaches for COVID-19 prevention in humanitarian contexts."

In Sub-Saharan Africa, adolescent girls aged 15-19 account for more than 80% of new adolescent HIV infections, and young women aged 15-24 have HIV infection rates two-fold higher than their young men counterparts. OUR IDEA: This innovative study will identify pathways from structural drivers of climate-related factors and poverty to HIV prevention outcomes via resource scarcity (water, food and sanitation insecurity). We focus on 2 Kenyan locations (1: urban slums in Nairobi [Kibera, Mukuru, Mathare], 2: rural and peri-urban Kisumu, on Lake Victoria) greatly impacted by climate change.

HIV prevalence among gbMSM in Jamaica is 33%-the Caribbean's highest. Our 2013-16 CIHR-funded research identified social and health disparities associated with HIV infection among gbMSM in Jamaica. Although 95% of people living with HIV live in low and middle-income countries (LMIC), we know little about strategies
to increase antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence with HIV-positive gbMSM in LMIC. Suboptimal ART adherence may contribute to virological failure and death. OUR IDEA: Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMA) capture human experiences and health practices in 'normal routines' and contexts using texts on mobile phones. Participants respond in real time. Ecological momentary interventions combine EMA's real-time assessment of contextual
factors with care provision in one's natural environment. We will develop and pilot-test the 'Social Ecological Approaches to Research on Care for HIV' (SEARCH) EMI to improve ART adherence. SEARCH has 2 components: daily EMA+ peer navigation. While used to manage various health conditions (e.g. diabetes), EMI's utility for ART adherence is understudied.
OUR APPROACH: Our project involves: Phase 1: qualitative work with HIV-positive gbMSM in Jamaica to develop SEARCH components; Phase 2: randomized pilot study with 150 HIV-positive gbMSM in Kingston, Ocho Rios and Montego Bay, Jamaica. Arm 1: SEARCH (EMA+peer navigation), Arm 2: standard of care. Phase 3: Qualitative interviews, workshops, and mixed-methods analyses to assess SEARCH's feasibility and acceptability to inform scale-up. IMPACT: We build on our successful CIHR-funded research that highlighted social/health disparities with HIV-positive gbMSM in Jamaica to develop and pilot test SEARCH, an innovative EMI to improve ART adherence.

Contexts of historical and ongoing racism, disconnection from culture and land, and intergenerational trauma contribute to these health disparities. Our CIHR-funded research demonstrated the potential of Fostering Open eXpression among Youth (FOXY) and Strengths, Masculinities & Sexual Health (SMASH). FOXY and SMASH are arts-based, culturally-grounded, strengths-focused and Indigenous-led sexual health programs to improve sexual health outcomes among Northern and Indigenous youth. We also found age, gender and sexual orientation differences in FOXY and SMASH outcomes, pointing to the need for mixed-methods research to further explore and address health needs and priorities of diverse youth in the NWT. OUR IDEA: We will conduct a longitudinal cohort study with Northern and Indigenous youth in the NWT to explore trajectories of health and resilience. We will conduct mixed-methods research to explore social contexts that shape health and wellbeing, and illuminate the ways in which youth navigate these contexts. 1) We will conduct intervention adaptation using realist evaluation with qualitative and quantitative methods to explore how to better meet the needs of youth. 2) We will conduct FOXY and SMASH school-based workshops, with a pre-and post test, 6-month, 12-month and 18-month follow-up surveys. 3) We will conduct longitudinal qualitative interviews with youth to explore social ecological factors associated with health and resilience trajectories. 4) Interconnected knowledge mobilization. IMPACT: We will gather and integrate multiple knowledge sources to refine sexual health programs to better meet the needs of Northern and Indigenous youth in the NWT, and evaluate the long term effects of participating in arts-based sexual health programs. We fill knowledge gaps of resilience and wellbeing among Northern and Indigenous youth in the NWT."

The goals described in this proposal relate to the development of a team and an intervention aimed at correcting the marginalization of Indigenous peoples with respect to TB programming and, further, to reduce the incidence of TB in their communities. This proposal describes the development of a team with four  interconnected communities in a high-incidence region to 1) make relevant to Indigenous Peoples the Tuberculosis Patients' Charter of Rights, 2) create a regional coalition that would advocate for local priorities and the removal of barriers to health equity associated with TB transmission, infection and disease to the proposed team of stakeholders and upstream to the Partners for Engagement and Knowledge Exchange
(PEKEs); and 3) document the development of a regional, non-jurisdictional framework for population health interventions using an implementation science approach. The communities would participate as a region rather than a patchwork of jurisdictions and exclusive ¬TB programming efforts that have heretofore operated exclusively. Following the team development stage and in the second component, each community will implement a local level intervention. As such, the regional framework is a program-level intervention, within which community level priorities can be advanced."

several risk factors including undernutrition at early age, sedentary behaviour, poor diet, and heredity. South Africa's
evolving burden of diseases is particularly challenging due to persisting infant malnutrition that co-exists with high
prevalence of obesity notably among women, and rising rates of diseases such as type 2 diabetes.

It is recognised that prevention of obesity in women of reproductive age is critical both for their health and for that of their
children but efforts to address the paradoxical challenges of stunting in early childhood and escalating obesity have been
largely unsuccessful. To date, interventions in overweight pregnant women have not produced appreciable impact on
pregnancy and birth outcomes. This suggests that the pre-conception periods may be key windows of opportunity to
intervene to prevent obesity and contribute to the survival and wellbeing of newborns throughout their lives.
This project will begin laying the foundations for healthy trajectories by improving women's health prior to and during
pregnancy and reinforcing optimal health in the infant. A team of experts from South Africa (SA) and Canada will focus on a
longitudinal analysis of how early-life exposures in the preconception period and during pregnancy, infancy and childhood
impact life-long trajectories of health and development of children in SA. The research team will recruit women of
childbearing age from Soweto, a historically disadvantaged urban area of Johannesburg, to establish a preconception cohort
and evaluate the impact of a package of interventions on children's health, cognitive and behavioural outcomes. The team
will engage with community and policy makers to ensure that the information that will be generated can be applied to policies
and practices in SA and potentially other LMICs to enhance the life-long wellbeing of children."

Research has demonstrated that women and young people experience violence and engage in HIV risk behaviours in unique ways. Therefore it is important to examine how social and structural factors affect youth and women who use illicit drugs to better inform the development of tailored interventions addressing violence and HIV infection. 

The objective of my proposal is to inform policy and programming to improve the health of drug users in Canada, particularly women and youth. I will examine structural features of health programmes and services for youth, including age limits on HIV prevention supplies and abstinence-based policies in health and housing services, and how these features affect exposure to violence and associated HIV risk. Second, I will examine the role of social networks and supports including friends, partners and family on the production of violence and HIV-related risks. I will conduct a nine-month critical ethnography and conduct in-depth interviews with street youth and adults who inject drugs and local service providers. The findings will contribute to developing knowledge and strategies to reduce the violence and harms young people and women who use drugs face."
Breaking the Silence: Developing a Sexual Health Intervention for Young Men in the Northwest Territories,"['Lys, Candice L']",['N/A'],"['Community-Based Research', 'Intervention Research', ""Men'S Health"", 'Mixed Methodologies', 'Northwest Territories', 'Sexual Health', 'Social Determinants Of Health', 'Youth']",150000.0,197423,"Compared to other Canadian youth, young people in the Northwest Territories (NWT) suffer disproportionately from negative sexual health outcomes.  Several studies measure statistics regarding sexual health among NWT youth, however, little research exists that asks youth why these sexual health problems exist and how health professionals can best address these issues.  Despite numerous past and present sexual health promotion programs in the NWT, persistently high rates of adolescent pregnancies and the increasing prevalence of STIs indicate that these initiatives are not achieving their intended goals.  Although many factors likely contribute to the ineffectiveness of these initiatives, I argue that a fundamental problem is the failure of these programs to involve in-depth input from youth during the research and development phases.  

While my recent Master's thesis research examines the barriers and facilitators to positive, empowered, and safer sexual health for young women in the NWT, future research needs to include the voice of young men in the North.  Recognizing this gap in sexual health research, my doctoral dissertation will build upon the findings of my Master's thesis research to develop a culturally- and developmentally-appropriate youth-focused sexual health intervention for young men in the NWT.  The proposed community-based research will involve a three phase approach.  During phase I of this doctoral research, I will do interviews with young men to determine their sexual health experiences, needs, and recommendations for sexual health interventions.  Phase II will address the themes that arose during phase I interviews as well as my previous research with young women, to develop, administer, and analyze a sexual health survey.  Finally, Phase III will involve focus groups with youth, parents, public health professionals, and other stakeholders to design an intervention that targets the needs and desires of the young male population in the NWT."

Two major life stressors include finding out about the diagnosis and adjusting to treatment demands.  Parents play a central role in the life of a child diagnosed with cancer.  They must provide the home care for the child and as a result must be equipped with coping skills to deal with the demands of work, family care and care for the diagnosed child.  When social and informational support are used the family is seen as a unit, optimism is maintained and the parent is more capable of understanding the child's diagnosis and treatment.  Thereby, social support plays an important role in the care of a child diagnosed with cancer.  yet some parents do not seek social support, which may be due to their geographic location, isolation, or lack of time.  Considering the popularity of social media sites such as Facebook, an examination of the role of the virtual social support system in increasing coping could provide insight into an additional avenue of inexpensive patient and family support."

HIV Prevention 2.0: The Trouble with Apps,"['MacAulay, Margaret']",['N/A'],"['Canada', 'E-Health', 'Gay Men', 'Gender', 'Hiv Prevention', 'Internet', 'Qualitative Research', 'Sexuality', 'United States', 'Web 2.0']",1500.0,311387,"Sex-seeking apps such as Grindr have helped gay men craft pseudonymous personas, extend communication, and introduce users who might not otherwise meet. This presents challenges and opportunities for HIV prevention, as apps represent novel risk environments that amplify some of prevention's pre-existing challenges while also offering new opportunities for outreach and engagement. While stakeholders such as public health, community-based groups and technologists have experimented with Web 2.0 tools, little evidence suggests that any of these approaches are effective. Practitioners know that digital approaches are necessary but nobody is quite certain about how this should be done. Based on stakeholder interviews conducted in Vancouver and San Francisco, I suggest that many of the challenges associated with Internet interventions come not from the technology itself but are mediated by a range of social, political, cultural and economic factors that we need to take into account during design and implementation. This presentation identifies a number of these issues cited by practitioners, including economic cutbacks, privacy concerns and institutional inertia when it comes to sexuality and health. Taken together, they suggest that our technologies are embedded within complex structures that can often frustrate efforts to sufficiently leverage them for HIV prevention. However, this does not mean that we should throw the baby out with the bathwater. Technology studies and the history of innovation, for example, suggest that failure, rather than success, is the norm. This means that we should continue developing apps in this area rather than give up at the first sign of ""failure"". We also need to be aware that while technological change feels sudden and rapid, changing technology itself is a slow process. I end by encouraging us to keep this in mind, as sexual health is an exciting and important area that needs more creative thinking around technology."

In this meta-narrative systematic review, we will synthesize the research on e-cigarettes and vapour devices with respect to their possible harms to health and potential use as a harm reduction or tobacco cessation device. Consumer demand for these devices is rapidly growing in Canada and elsewhere but the public health community is divided over how vapour devices will impact the tobacco epidemic. Policy makers and public health researchers are asking: What are the health risks of e-cigarettes, and how do they compare to cigarettes? Will e-cigarette experimentation by youth lead to cigarette use? Can the devices be effective for tobacco cessation? and What is the potential toxicity of second-hand vapour?Through a comprehensive and unbiased review, we will endeavor to explain the discrepancies in the literature, and contribute to resolving the conflict in public health over this issue. The project's Knowledge Users (KUs) recently approached the Centre for Addictions Research of BC (CARBC) looking for evidence to answer their questions, and the current project team coalesced from these initial discussions. The Nominated PI is a CIHR/PHAC Applied Public Health Research Chair with extensive experience in leading knowledge synthesis and dissemination projects, and working with KUs to develop policy and practice recommendations. The Provincial Health Officer for BC is the Principal KU, bringing expertise in tobacco control by-laws, public health policy and practice, and harm reduction. The Co-PI is Director of CARBC providing research and policy leadership on the public health and safety impacts of substance use. Other KUs, investigators and staff offer important substantive and technical expertise related to public health policy, tobacco control strategy, knowledge mobilization (KMb), e-cigarettes, and library science. Together our team members have the knowledge and skills to successfully complete the project .An integrated knowledge translation (KT) approach is central to the proposed synthesis. Our research questions are based on our KUs' interests in vapour devices as an emerging policy issue. To collect the available evidence, we will use meta-narrative synthesis (MNS) to conduct a systematic review. MNS is a relatively recent synthesis methodology developed to summarize, synthesize and interpret a diverse body of literature where studies have used different methods, theoretical perspectives, and data types. The project is organized into six phases: planning, searching, mapping, appraisal, synthesis, and ending with recommendations and KT/KMb. The KUs will be engaged during all phases of the project. Through deliberation, team dialogue, and consultation with other end-users (beyond the immediate team), key messages will be summarized, and recommendations developed for practice, policy, and further research. Appropriate KT products will be produced based on the KUs' direction. We will identify potential stakeholder groups and develop strategies for disseminating the project's findings to them. The ultimate goal of this systematic review is to provide synthesized evidence to inform decisions and recommendations regarding use of e-cigarettes and vapour devices."

Is it safe to go to my vaccination appointment? Could COVID-19 make me seriously ill? Will new COVID-19 vaccines be safe, since they are being made so quickly? Will there be enough COVID-19 vaccines for everyone? Like everyone else in the world, Canadians face many concerns about COVID-19, and Canadian health care systems are grappling with the direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic. Physical distancing measures that have been put in place to reduce spread of COVID-19 have led to challenges in providing, and accessing, routine vaccines for all ages, such as those for measles or meningitis. At the same time, one of the primary options for containment of the pandemic is through future COVID-19 vaccines. However, public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines is already being questioned in the media, and initial vaccine shortages will require prioritization of who receives the vaccine first. An understanding of Canadians' acceptance of future vaccines and their perspectives on vaccine prioritization will be critical before vaccines are rolled-out. The aim of this project is to support the public health system in these tasks. We will begin by assessing how provincial and territorial health systems are delivering routine vaccinations during the pandemic, examining what the public think about routine vaccines during this time, and then measuring whether less/more people are getting vaccinated with routine vaccines during the pandemic. Second, since population support for a vaccination program is critical to its success, we will examine public acceptability of new COVID-19 vaccines and the determinants of acceptability. The project will provide Canada's public health system with essential information to organize the distribution of routine vaccines during the pandemic and to prepare for the inevitable COVID-19 mass vaccination program that is on the horizon."

The sharing economy involves peer-to-peer platforms (e.g. UberX smart phone apps) connecting self-employed providers and users for the exchange of goods and services. We lack models to consider health risks and conditions for entrepreneurial groupings of self-employed individuals connected by new technological platforms. 

It is unclear what workplace risks, behaviours, and occupational injury conditions are related to the structure of work in this environment. Passenger safety implications are also unclear. Occupational health and safety regulators are struggling to develop programs and policies but current efforts are haphazard and scattered.

Taking the case of UberX ride sharing, we will conduct a developmental evaluation of occupational health risk and regulation opportunities in UberX work. A developmental evaluation approach is particularly useful in a complex dynamic environment where multiple pathways are possible. We will examine how 'ride sharing' male and female drivers navigate the risks of the taxi driving industry (which has the highest fatality rates of any occupation) vis-a-vis taxi drivers and how the UberX platform may influence risk perception and safety behaviour.

This study will use qualitative research methods, including interviews and focus groups, document analysis and community forums, to examine how key UberX and related parties appraise and navigate workplace risks, passenger safety risk, and envisage appropriate regulation for a changing health risk landscape. This study will develop knowledge on occupational health and safety risks, how they differ for men and women, their mechanisms, and policy options for the fast-growing sharing economy. It will provide policy makers with knowledge needed to develop policy and programs for new conditions."

Previous epidemics have increased mental health problems and evidence of such impacts is already present in China.

To address this, we propose to examine the impact of COVID-19 on mental health in an existing longitudinal observational cohort of 1502 community adults. This group has been assessed over four waves to date, three prior to COVID-19 and one during COVID-19. Leveraging these existing pre-pandemic and intra-pandemic data, we will ascertain the pandemic's effects on high-priority areas of mental health and substance use. Specifically, we propose four primary aims. The first and second are to examine the impacts on mental health symptoms (depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder) and substance use (alcohol, cannabis, tobacco, and illicit drug use), respectively. The third aim is to examine the mechanisms by which these effects arise, including impacts of the pandemic and interrelationships among mental health and substance use. The fourth aim is to address where vulnerabilities exist by identifying high-risk and high-resilience subgroups within the larger cohort of individuals. We will also pursue two secondary aims, including sex/gender differences (separately) and targeted qualitative interviews of individuals exhibiting high-risk or high-resilience profiles. Our findings will be informed by Knowledge Users including a clinical psychiatrist, a clinical psychologist, and leaders from the Mental Health Commission of Canada, the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction, and Veterans Affairs Canada. Collectively, the research will provide a critical longitudinal perspective on the mental health impacts of COVID-19 that will provide substantive insights for government and healthcare responses in Canada and beyond."
Evaluation of the human burden of disease from third generation cephalosporin resistant Escherichia coli and Salmonella infections and the contribution from antimicrobial use in food producing animals,"['MacKinnon, Melissa']",['N/A'],"['Antibiotic', 'Antimicrobial', 'Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Burden Of Disease', 'Epidemiology', 'Escherichia Coli', 'Food Safety', 'Public Health', 'Salmonella', 'Surveillance']",105000.0,365485,"Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections that can be serious and in some cases fatal. They have saved countless lives and have extended life expectancy since their discovery in the early 20th century. Unfortunately, their widespread use also contributes to the development and spread of antibiotic resistance in illness-causing bacteria, with the result that antibiotic treatment becomes ineffective. The problem is a serious 21st century global public health crisis and steps need to be taken urgently to preserve the effectiveness of these precious medicines. Many types of antibiotics are used both in humans and animals. While it is known that antibiotic use in food animals can lead to antibiotic resistance, the extent to which this use contributes to resistant bacterial infections in humans is unknown. This research will address this important need by determining the impact of antibiotic resistance in enteric (gut-related) bacteria on human health in Canada and the contribution from antibiotic use in animals, focusing on 3rd generation cephalosporin resistance in Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Salmonella. There are three components to the research: 1) determination of the human health impact of antibiotic resistance in selected E. coli and Salmonella human infections; 2) identification of the proportion of these antibiotic resistant infections involving animal sources; and 3) mathematical modelling of antibiotic resistance selection by antibiotic use in animals, spread of resistant E. coli and Salmonella through contaminated food and environment to humans, and resultant risk of human illness from antibiotic resistant infection with these bacteria. The results from this research are essential for improvement of veterinary antibiotic use policy in Canada and around the globe. All Canadians will benefit from improved and appropriate antibiotic use that will preserve current antibiotic effectiveness and reduce the rate of development of antibiotic resistance."

These effects often persist, and can contribute to ongoing cycles of violence and poor health. Child maltreatment (CM) and intimate partner violence (IPV) are global public health problems for which there are few proven interventions; also, while thought to affect primarily females, there is evidence that exposure to child physical abuse is at least as, if not more, common in males, and both women and men are victims of IPV and its mental health consequences. Despite the known link between mental health and family violence, they have received relatively little research focus, especially in the areas of intervention. With family violence affecting at least 30% of Canadians, there is a pressing need for a coherent and integrated approach to the problem of family violence and its mental health outcomes, and to look at this for both males and females. Our proposed Centre for Research Development in Gender, Mental Health and Violence Across the Lifespan has three main goals:  (1) to increase our understanding of the links between mental health problems and CM and IPV; (2) to develop strategies to prevent or reduce CM, IPV and subsequent mental health problems; and (3) to share and exchange knowledge within the team of Centre investigators and with stakeholders such as policy-makers, health and social service providers, advocates and members of the public. We will do this by: (1) creating an international network of researchers, clinicians and policy-makers to set priorities for research to reduce family violence, and to better understand the links between CM, IPV and mental health by analysing data from existing studies, (2) understanding and fostering resilience in mental health outcomes after exposure to violence and (3) developing innovations in knowledge exchange tailored to the area of violence."

The Emerging Challenge of Urban Malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa: an Inquiry of Malaria-Urbanization Dynamics,"['Maheu-Giroux, Mathieu']",['N/A'],"['Cost-Effectiveness', 'Epidemiology', 'Geographic Information Systems (Gis)', 'Longitudinal', 'Malaria', 'Mathematical Modeling', 'Population Health', 'Population Health Interventions', 'Urban Health', 'Urbanization']",105000.0,257495,"Africa is the fastest urbanizing continent in the world and its urban population is expected to double between 2000 and 2030. More than 60% of these urban citizens, however, inhabit areas of informal settlements characterized by poor housing, lack of sanitation, and deficient drainage of surface water. Such conditions are potentially conducive to malaria transmission. In fact, the incidence of malaria has risen dramatically in urban centers of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) in recent decades. The emerging challenge of urban malaria in SSA calls for integrated multi-sectored prevention and control strategies but current understanding of the malaria-urbanization dynamics is limited. The proposed research thus aims to: i) investigate the unique contribution and interactions, of individuals, neighborhoods, communities, health systems, and environmental determinants of urban malaria, ii) review the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of current approaches to malaria control, and iii) build a detailed predictive model of urban malaria that will serve to rationalize, prioritize, and optimize sustainable and cost-effective control strategies to reduce disease burden. Epidemiological data from large longitudinal studies in Dar es Salaam (Tanzania; N=64,537) and Accra (Ghana; N=15,000) will be analyzed, as well as high-resolution satellite imagery. Knowledge, attitudes, and practices surveys will be conducted and relevant data on control methods collected. The effect of new promising prevention and control methods will be modeled and their cost-effectiveness assessed. Findings are expected to inform program managers and local health authorities on the best practices to mitigate this preventable crisis by translating relevant knowledge into policy and practice. This study will provide much needed scope on the potential consequences of fast and unplanned urbanization on vector-borne diseases epidemiology in SSA, and on malaria in particular."

Among many ingredients that contribute to our life satisfaction, the sense of belonging we have to our communities has been linked with many health benefits, but also depends on where we live. Some neighbourhoods are designed to promote social activities and active public lives, while others are less focused on community connectedness. Many neighbourhoods are structured around other needs, such as automobile transport or industry. More and more Canadians live in cities than ever before. We also tend to spend more time in our neighbourhoods as we get older. Our neighbourhood environments are likely to impact our ability to build and grow our communities. My goal is to identify which aspects of our neighbourhoods impact our sense of community belonging and determine how much neighbourhoods influence the relationship between community belonging and the health of Canadians. I am conducting a large-scale study using data on participants that have been linked with their hospital records and death records for whom we have postal code information. From there, I will map participants to their neighbourhoods and explore their environmental conditions, such as active living friendliness (i.e. walkability), air pollution, and heat. Then, I will examine the relationship between these environmental factors, community belonging, and health outcomes such as hospital visits and premature death. I will also be focusing on specific groups of interest, such as older adults. This project will give us new insight into whether neighbourhood-related interventions to encourage community belonging might help prevent illness and premature death."

How to Handle Missing Spirometry Data in Population-Based Studies?,"['Ma, Jinhui']","['Bassim, Carol W', 'Duong, Mylinh', 'Griffith, Lauren E', 'Mayhew, Alexandra J', 'Raina, Parminder S', 'So, Hon Yiu', 'Thabane, Lehana', 'Verschoor, Chris P']","['Missing Data', 'Population-Based Study', 'Spirometry']",70000.0,410748,"Spirometry has increasingly been utilized in population-based studies including the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), to assess the presence of lung disease at the population level. According to the literature, about 10 to 30% of participants in population-based studies do not have valid spirometry data due to either contraindication from spirometry tests or poor quality spirometry. Of the 30,097 participants within the CLSA comprehensive cohort, 29.1% have no spirometry data available at baseline due to low quality spirometry or contraindication for spirometry and are considered as ""missing"" in the statistical analysis. The substantial amount of missing spirometry data may lead to efficiency reduction and serious bias, which undermine the validity of research findings. 

Two measures are commonly collected from the spirometry for evaluation of lung function: forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC), which measure flow rate and lung volume in one maximal breath. The ratio of FEV1 to FVC together with FEV1 and FVC are used to identify obstructive and restrictive lung defects. The FEV1 and FVC are found to have a very strong, age-independent linear relationship in healthy individuals; however, this relationship does not hold among those with lung impairment. Traditional imputation techniques are inappropriate to handle the missing spirometry data since (1) FEV1 and FVC are paired measures from one spirometry test and they are observed or missing simultaneously; and (2) the relationship between FEV1 and FVC depends on whether an individual has lung impairment.

This investigation will help researchers appreciate the complexity of missing spirometry data and adopt appropriate imputation methods to handle them. Moreover, methods developed in this investigation can be generalized to handle the missingness of any paired data, such as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, a common phenomenon in health research."

And although these infections can have serious consequences, including miscarriage, arthritis, kidney failure, and  death, just how many Canadians go on to experience such consequences, and what this costs our healthcare system, is unknown. Without this knowledge, policy makers struggle to protect Canadians, unable to adequately argue for sufficient investments to make food safer, and clinicians do not have the evidence they need to avert such serious consequences in their patients.

Previously, the approach required to accurately determine the serious consequences of foodborne infections across the population was lacking. Now, with decades of population-wide electronic health records, including sufficient details on foodborne infections, we are finally able to address this issue. The province of BC is uniquely positioned to support this novel work. BC's rich collection of health records allows us to seamlessly explore the various medical consequences experienced by everyone in BC who tests positive for a foodborne infection. Thus, we will conduct a longitudinal cohort study, across the population of BC, determining what fraction of people develop serious consequences following a foodborne infection, what this costs the health system, and what risks infected Canadians face (e.g., of miscarriage, death), regardless of whether or not they are already vulnerable (e.g., young, old, pregnant).

This work will uncover the real risks faced by the >4 million Canadians infected from food each year. This knowledge will allow provincial and national policy makers to invest in making food safer, and physicians to better diagnose and treat patients, which will ultimately prevent foodborne infections, and their serious consequences, among Canadians."

This is changing however, as their risk of cancer increases over time.  Once diagnosed with cancer, First Nations, Inuit and Métis people are suspected to be less likely to survive their cancer than their non-indigenous peers.  The patterns of cancer in First Nations, Inuit and Métis are challenging to study, mainly because it is difficult (if not impossible) to identify the records of First Nations, Inuit and Métis people in administrative health databases.  This challenge, among others, has led to a lack of research about the burden of cancer in these groups, despite the fact that cancer is among the top three causes of death in First Nations and Métis.  A recent merge of three national databases has provided an important opportunity to examine cancer risk and survival in Canadian First Nations and Métis.  Using linked data from the 1991 Canadian long-form Census, the Canadian Mortality Database and the Canadian Cancer Registry, we intend to fulfill four objectives: 1) to describe the incidence of cancer among First Nations and Métis adults in Canada; 2) to describe cancer survival among First Nations and Métis adults in Canada; 3) to identify trends in incidence and survival, (A) over time and (B) by province/territories; and 4) to compare all the above to non-First Nations, Inuit and Métis.  The proposed study, involving collaboration between Cancer Care Ontario, Statistics Canada, the Assembly of First Nations and the Métis National Council will provide First Nations and Métis groups and their cancer control partners with a description of their cancer burden and a metric by which to determine how they compare to each other and to the general population.  Using rigorous methods, the proposed research aims to generate the information necessary to plan and provide effective, culturally-appropriate cancer prevention and control programs."

There is a large amount of evidence from around the world indicating that parenting programs are impactful in enhancing caregiver and child outcomes, including reducing and preventing harsh/violent parenting practices and child mental health issues, such as child behaviour problems. Although there is a great deal known about the positive impact of parenting programs, less is known about the overall effectiveness of such programs in Canada. In addition, it is not known whether the effects of Canadian parenting programs vary based on the characteristics and environments of participating families. For instance, we do not know whether caregivers of different genders, ethnicities and levels of social disadvantage and functioning benefit more or less from parenting programs in Canada. Examining whether these factors play a role in caregiver and child outcomes can reveal whether all families benefit equally from parenting programs. To address these gaps in the Canadian literature, this fellowship aims to compile the evidence on parenting programs via a review and analyses of existing data to determine what programs are delivered in Canada, to whom, and with what impact. This fellowship proposes to use a rigorous approach whereby individual level data is considered within the review to examine whether there are potential inequities in access to and benefit attained from parenting programs in Canada. This work is needed to ensure the translation of Canada's commitment towards real progress towards equity in the health and well-being of all families.

Mother-to-child transmission accounts for very few infections in Canada, however Aboriginal children are over-represented among these cases (PHAC, 2010). The dynamics of the epidemic among Aboriginal communities suggest implications beyond individuals living with HIV, however very little is known about what this means in the context of the broader family. This study seeks to address this gap by engaging with Aboriginal families affected by HIV to identify Aboriginal-specific recommended solutions toward the development of programmatic intervention models that address and support all members of a family affected by HIV. Grounded in a community-based approach and indigenous research framework, we will engage Aboriginal families affected by HIV throughout a multi-method study undertaken in 3 phases, respecting the principles of OCAP and integrating knowledge translation and exchange (KTE). Phase 1 will involve a programmatic scan of formal and informal services, supports, policies and programs designed for Aboriginal people living with HIV and their families. Phase 2 will involve storytelling circles in 4 sites across Canada to explore the impact of HIV on families, based upon the perspectives of different members of Aboriginal families affected by HIV. In Phase 3 we will host a family gathering of affected Aboriginal families to share our findings, strategize meaningful KTE approaches and identify priority intervention options. Each phase builds on the previous one with careful attention to KTE throughout to build engagement in the research and increase the uptake, reach and impact of the findings to ensure that this important research contributes to new knowledge, awareness and action related to the needs of Aboriginal families living with HIV and AIDS."

In 2008, census data indicated Aboriginal people accounted for 3.8% of the population in Canada and the Public Health Agency estimated 8.0% of all prevalent HIV infections. Often times within the Aboriginal community, the overlap of 'vulnerabilities' exacerbates the complexity of an effective response to HIV.

The AHA Centre is co-led by Ms. Renée Masching, Canadian Aboriginal AIDS Network with Dr. Charlotte Reading, University of Victoria and consists of a 17 member leadership team, of which 12 members are of Aboriginal descent and 2 are respected Elders. Summarizing the vision and mission; the Centre will strategically contribute to an effective response to HIV & AIDS-related issues relevant to Aboriginal Peoples in Canada and international Indigenous populations. The team will foster an innovative environment striving for scientific excellence and trust where investigators with a wide range of experience, Aboriginal community members and Aboriginal People Living with HIV & AIDS share responsibility for direction setting and decision making.

Our community-based research team privileges Indigenous knowledges, engage in two-eyed seeing and a decolonizing approach to research. This approach emphasizes the strengths of communities and meaningfully integrates western methodological approaches. The AHA Centre's focus includes partnership and capacity building, research promotion and support, and action oriented knowledge translation. The structure of the AHA Centre entrenches community leadership linked with expanded resources from which to draw policy, practice, research and cultural expertise to stop the spread of HIV and establish excellence in care, treatment and support."
Sowing Seeds: Informing International Research Excellence on HIV Among Indigenous Populations,"['Masching, Renee']",['N/A'],"['Aids', 'Community-Based Research', 'Ethics', 'Global', 'Hiv', 'Indigenous']",2800.0,383079,"The International Indigenous Working Group on HIV & AIDS (IIWGHA) was established in 2009. From inception IIWGHA has been interested in research as a resource to describe and understand the impact of HIV in Indigenous communities. United by the urgent need to respond to HIV and sexual health across cultures, IIWGHA established a sub-committee to develop and undertake research. After discussing diverse research ideas and agreed priorities for epidemiological research, the PROCESS for moving forward was unclear. How will ownership of research data be shared? What values are shared and what expectations must be met? How will IIWGHA approach research development and implementation?

IIWGHA has a strong history of developing strategic documents. This ability to strategize led to the decision to develop a Protocol, to be ratified by all the member countries. A CIHR research grant was received and supported an in-person meeting in Guatemala, hundreds of emails and bi-monthly teleconferences, collaborative writing and English/Spanish translations and interpretation. In December 2017 the Sowing Seeds Protocol: Conducting Research on HIV Among Indigenous Peoples: Values, Approaches and Guidelines was publicly released in English. Spanish and French versions will be completed by March 2018. Parallel to finalization, a large multi-country team have been investigating Indigenous knowledge translation. Serving as a test of the protocol, team leads have referenced our work when guidance is needed.

Canada has led IIWGHA's research activities, largely due to a favourable funding environment. Our shared International guidelines will be used to mobilize funders around the world. Therefore, it is essential to share our Protocol inviting more to learn about our values, approaches and guidelines. More resources and background materials will be developed to support the Protocol. IIWGHA's momentum will continue to promote and implement this process."

Using Indigenous research methods, this project will establish an Ontario-wide Indigenous guidance council to inform the design and delivery of research activities to ensure balanced power dynamics, increased trust, and a sense of project ownership. To facilitate reciprocal relationships and rapport building, care packages that were created with community input will be given to partners to distribute to previously incarcerated clients. We will host talking circles (Brown & Di Lallo, 2020) with council members throughout the project's duration. Additionally, we will conduct one-on-one interviews with both Indigenous and non-Indigenous criminal justice-related service providers as well as individuals with experiences with incarceration who have used healing or re-entry programs since their release to gain knowledge about interconnectedness of incarceration, gender, family relations, and reintegration into their community(s). This will be done with an intersectional lens that incorporates the Medicine Wheel teachings and accompanying knowledge from an Algonquin perspective (PI and Elders contributing). We are interested in learning if there are differences in gender and family-inclusive policies for those who were previously incarcerated and how to assist with reintegration and healing after their release."

Toutefois, les données récentes et locales sont rarissimes au regard de ces enjeux et ne permettent aucune généralisation à l'ensemble de cette population. Si quelques enquêtes rassemblent des données sur les comportements sexuels, elles se limitent pour la plupart à des items sur l'âge lors de la première relation sexuelle, l'utilisation du condom et de la contraception et le nombre de partenaires. Pourtant, selon la définition proposée dans les Lignes directrices canadiennes pour l'éducation en matière de santé sexuelle, la santé sexuelle surpasse cette dimension préventive et se définit comme « un état de bien-être physique, émotionnel, mental et social relié à la sexualité [et] ne saurait se réduire à l'absence de maladies, de dysfonctions ou d'infirmités ». Ainsi, ce manque au niveau des données probantes ne permet pas de comprendre les multiples dimensions de la réalité sexuelle et actuelle de ces jeunes, ce qui est portant nécessaire à l'élaboration de stratégies d'intervention prioritaires et efficaces. Dans cette optique, le présent projet vise, d'une part, à rendre accessible un diagnostic de la santé sexuelle globale des jeunes de 15 à 24 ans par le biais d'une étude provinciale représentative, et d'autre part, à concevoir un jeu vidéo éducatif basé sur ces données locales et actuelles. En effet, l'usage du jeu vidéo semble une voie des plus prometteuses en matière d'éducation à la sexualité, notamment car il s'agit d'un médium accessible et apprécié de la population ciblée, en plus de permettre un apprentissage différencié et expérientiel."

It combines observations from self-administered questionnaires and biological samples. Between 2013 and 2014, participants were recruited according to a stratified multistage sample plan based on 3 geographical entities (Montreal, Quebec and periphery regions) and a variety of school settings (ex. vocational schools, colleges, universities). Using Levesque & al. (2013) Access to health care framework, barriers to STBBI testing were explored. In the subgroup of 17-20 years old, 781 sexually active women and 508 sexually active men answered PIXEL questionnaire. Proportion of those participants who reported having sought for STBBI testing in the past 12 months was significantly lower among men than women. Among those participants, the most frequent barriers related to their ability to seek and reach for STBBI testing services were: ""Not having enough time"", ""Being scared of the results"", ""Not knowing where to go"" ""Having difficulties to get an appointment"",  ""Being afraid people would find out"" and ""Feeling uncomfortable having to talk with a nurse/doctor about sexuality"" Results illustrate certain disparities between 17-20 years old men and women access to STBBI testing services.

Specifically, we need to monitor capacity for planning, target-setting, implementation and scaling up, and assessing the impact of interventions and policies that aim to reduce the chronic disease burden. Numerous important CDP capacity-building initiatives have taken place in Canada since the 1980s, and the public health systems in all 10 Canadian provinces have undergone major health system restructuring and reforms. Considering these ongoing structural changes in the public health system, periodic assessment is key to understanding progress and achievements in expanding CDP capacity as we work towards implementing and scaling up effective CDP programming across Canada. To address the lack of nationally representative data on CDP capacity, our team developed the Public Health ORganizational CApacity STudy (PHORCAST), comprising two Canada-wide surveys of public health organizations engaged in CDP. In 2005 and 2010, we surveyed all organizations in Canada with mandates for population-level primary prevention of chronic disease (cancer, CVD, diabetes, chronic respiratory illness), healthy lifestyle promotion, or with a single-focus mandate for healthy eating, tobacco control or physical activity. PHORCAST has already provided unique empirical insights into Canada's preventive health system and identified areas that need improvement (human resource planning, development and training, monitoring changes over time in organizational capacity for CDP; evaluating CDP programs, policies and practices). We propose to conduct a third survey, now 10-15 years since the original surveys, using the same methods used in 2005 and 2010. Results will update the evidence base on organizational capacity for CDP to support strategic expansion of CDP interventions and policies to better respond to the growing chronic disease burden in Canada."
Beyond the problem & the intervention: Understanding contextual factors influencing adoption of a comprehensive school health program,"['Mbonu, Afekwo']",['N/A'],['Comprehensive School Health'],1500.0,304164,"Objectives: This qualitative inquiry was designed to explore factors that influence the adoption of a school health program (Go Girls!)

Methods: Using multiple cases, the focus was an in-depth exploration of perspectives of the decision-making process surrounding the program adoption.  Analysis of participants' perspectives as expressed through semi-structured interviews and document analysis will provide holistic understanding of the process. Roger's Diffusion of Innovation theory guides the design and analysis of data. Four schools within the Lakehead Public School Board where the program have been offered and adopted were invited to participate in this study. Key informants within the schools were chosen in order to capture the perspectives from various hierarchical levels.

Results: A key factor across all cases is the fit of the program within the schools' values and goals. That is, the program appropriately complements the schools' set goal. Another emerging factor across the cases is the ease of program delivery.

Conclusion: With the increasing priority to address healthy-active living among school-aged children, public health practitioners should consider the complexity of proposed school health programs and ensure that initiatives do not require additional resources from the school's already strained pool of resource"

The trails also are linked to better health outcomes in adults. Unfortunately, these trails were not constructed in an equitable way. First Nations and Métis children and adolescents living in Winnipeg were less likely to have access to the trails. First Nations and Métis children and adolescents also also fare more likely to experience mental health disorders.

We will leverage the databases used to make previous discoveries about urban trails to address several important questions related to the urban built environment that support physical activity (PA) and mental health for children and adolescents generally, than focus on equity for First Nations and Métis children and adolescents living in Winnipeg. First we will try to answer the questions: Does building an urban PA trail in a neighbourhood, lead to lower rates of mental health problems for children and adolescents. Then, to respond to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Call to Action #19 our team of Indigenous organizations, Indigenous scholars, Elders, policy makers and scientists will made inequities in mental health worse for First Nations and Métis youth. Using a community-based participatory approach, we will address UNDRIP articles #23 and 24 by identifying parts of the urban environment in that support PA to see if they protect urban First Nations and Métis children and adolescents from mental health disorders.

First, a policy scan will be conducted to describe the HPS policy environment in Nova Scotia. Based on this scan, a framework will be developed to characterize the critical components of HPS in Nova Scotia. Next, a school survey will be developed and administered in all Nova Scotia elementary schools to measure the extent of current HPS practices. Finally, interviews will be conducted with a sample of schools to describe the experiences of schools relating to the implementation of Provincial and School Board policies and programs. This research will provide insight into the effectiveness of current Provincial and School Board HPS policies and how schools could be better supported to facilitate the implementation of a HPS approach. Understanding the impact of Provincial and School Board investments will help to inform future policy decisions in Nova Scotia and across Canada. This study will also provide a wealth of practical information about ""best practices"" that will help to support future implementation of HPS.

We conducted interviews conducted with stakeholders from schools, recreation and sport settings and learned about the challenges and facilitators to improving the nutritional quality of foods provided. While stakeholders recognized that implementing healthy eating policies is 'the right thing to do', this was contradicted by current socio-cultural norms and a need to generate revenue. Wide-spread changes in cultural food norms and consideration of financial costs are needed to foster a supportive nutrition environment in settings where children live, learn and play."

These characteristics have also been noted in individuals who are incarcerated, and it is possible that sustaining a TBI could be a risk factor for future incarceration. The purpose of my study was to examine if TBI increased risk of incarceration and to examine if this relationship differed in young men and women. I identified approximately 1.5 million men and women, aged 18 to 28 years, who were living in the province of Ontario, Canada in 1997. I determined if these individuals had a TBI between 1997 and 2011 by extracting TBI-related hospital and ER visits from administrative records. I examined federal correctional records over the same time period to determine if individuals had been incarcerated. I found that TBI was an important risk factor for incarceration. Young men and women who had a TBI were three times more likely to be incarcerated than young men and women who did not have a TBI. My research suggests that sustaining a TBI increases the risk of being incarcerated. More research is needed to understand exactly the mechanisms behind this relationship so that effective gender-based interventions can be developed. These interventions could help divert Canadians away from the correctional system."

Innovative strategies that target barriers to physical activity are therefore a top public health priority. Features of neighbourhood design (the built environment) including green spaces, traffic lights, traffic speed and volume, curb cuts, lighting, and so on can enhance children's outdoor play, walking, and cycling. However, few studies evaluated how changes to these microscale features impact child and youth health. This 'research gap' is based in part on the complex and costly nature of community infrastructure changes that are most often outside the realm of possibility of research grants. However, we have been provided the unique opportunity to partner with the City of Vancouver as they redesign a neighbourhood to become more 'mobility friendly' for pedestrians. Specifically, the City of Vancouver has committed $3.4M to improve the Comox-Helmcken Greenway, a 3 km corridor in downtown Vancouver. We have developed a close partnership with the City and will work with them to assess whether targeted modifications to the neighbourhood influence; 1. child and youth physical activity, active transport, and fitness, 2. how children, youth, and their parents perceive and move within their neighbourhoods, and 3. barriers to adopting healthy behaviours. We will assess children, youth (and the perceptions of parents) before, during (while mobility habits will be disrupted), and after modifications to the neighbourhood are completed. As a final step we will intervene with an active transport to school program (post construction) to assess the influence of this program on child and youth physical activity and fitness. We envision that the new knowledge we generate will be used in future to guide decision-making and to develop new policies in the City of Vancouver. Lessons learned can also be adapted and applied in cities and towns, elsewhere."

Physically active older adults have better mobility, mental and social health than their inactive counterparts. Therefore, guided by implementation science principles (e.g., tailored for participants; adaptable to context), we co-designed Choose to Move (CTM) with older adults, community and government partners. CTM is a flexible, scalable community-based program that improved physical activity, mobility, social isolation and loneliness in older adults. From small beginnings, we scaled-up CTM over 8 years to reach >6000 older adults in British Columbia (BC). Our reservation was that CTM engaged primarily white older adults in Metro Vancouver; 77% were women. We now aim to expand the reach of CTM to better serve the needs of more diverse groups of older adults. We will support community-based seniors' services organizations (e.g., not-for-profits; neighbourhood houses) to adapt CTM to 'best fit' the older adults they serve, and build capacity in these organizations to deliver CTM. Through 5 projects, we will address 4 broad research objectives. We will: 1. Undertake evidence syntheses to identify knowledge gaps; 2. Describe how the CTM program and implementation strategies are adapted and implemented in older adults who are South Asian, older men or older adults in northern BC; 3. Evaluate whether readiness (e.g., organizational capacity), implementation strategies (e.g., training and technical support) and implementation factors (e.g., acceptability) influence how CTM is implemented; 4. Measure impact of CTM on physical activity and other health outcomes of older adults. Our impact will be engaged community organizations, a program that has been adapted to serve diverse older adults, a new generation of implementation scientists, and healthy, active and connected older adults."
A comparative study of pathways to first episode care for psychosis in three ethnic groups in Ontario,"['Mckenzie, Kwame J']","['Archie, Suzanne', 'Golding, Llewellyn A', 'Hamilton, Hayley A', 'Kidd, Sean A', 'Kirmayer, Laurence J', 'Lurie, Steve', 'Noh, Samuel', 'Simich, Laura L', 'Tang, Taryn', 'Tuck, Andrew J', 'Williams, Charmaine C']","['Ethno-Racial Groups', 'Mental Health', 'Pathways To Care', 'Psychosis']",401733.0,200849,"The sooner an individual gets treatment for psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia, the better the outcome. In an effort to assist this goal, early intervention services have been set up across Ontario. However, studies of these services suggest that there is a greater delay between developing symptoms of psychosis and getting treatment in people of African and Caribbean origin than European Canadians. These delays may lead to more severe illness with worse prognosis and more involvement of emergency services and the prison and justice systems.

The reason for the differences between groups is not clear. It could be that  people of African and Caribbean origins are less likely to know how to get help from first episode services, or that they are less likely to attend their general practitioner and be referred to services, or the fact that some in these groups may prefer to use complementary therapies before trying first episode services. In order to promote early treatment and better outcome, a clear understanding is needed of the different routes people take to getting care and why they take a particular route. For instance if there is significant delay in treatment because of the use of complementary treatment, health planners may want to work with complementary therapists in areas where people of African and Caribbean origin live in order to develop better pathways to first episode care.

This study will document and compare the pathways taken to first episode psychosis services for African, Caribbean and European origin Canadians living in Toronto. Pathways to care will be assessed using a methodology designed by the World Health Organization. Where differences in pathways are identified, the study will use focus groups involving clients, their families, carers and community members to help researchers further understand the reasons why these occur. This information could form the basis of targeted interventions to increase health equity in Ontario."

In the past, Indigenous people were devastated by pandemics including smallpox, Spanish flu and H1N1 and cases of COVID-19 are now rising quickly in many communities. This proposal builds on the activities of our existing project that focuses on COVID-19 and Indigenous people. Named kitatipithitamak mithwayawin, Cree for control or sovereignty over wellbeing, its goal is to document the past, present and future impacts of pandemics. And to support Indigenous communities as they respond to COVID-19. This proposal similarly aims to extend its scope and impact in three ways.

i)Past work: Evaluate impacts of our existing activities focusing on Indigenous risk communication. These reflect videos, webinars, workshops, and infographics that are shared on our project website < http://covid19indigenous.ca/> and Facebook page < https://www.facebook.com/covid19indigenous/> 

ii)Present work: Expand a new digital health initiative that will use web and mobile apps to provide health directors with real-time health data for local decision-making. We will expand these efforts to include any First Nations, Métis, and Inuit communities in Canada wanting to participate. We will also evaluate the benefits and any shortcomings of these apps in local decision-making regarding COVID-19 and wellbeing as a whole.

iii)Future work: Hold an international (virtual) conference in May 2021 that brings Indigenous communities and scholars from around the world to share their experiences with COVID-19 and to learn from one another. This will ideally result in an Indigenous-led network of support that helps communities respond to pandemics in the future. The impacts of the conference and network will also be evaluated.  

In closing, this proposal expands our existing Indigenous-led project on COVID-19 and does so in ways that serve the interests of any and all Indigenous communities regardless of location."

The program is organized around two research areas.First, building on existing and emerging national and international research collaborations a series of comparative and cross-jurisdictional studies on occupational health and safety and workers' compensation will be conducted that have the focus of identifying differences in policies and practices that could lead to safer workplaces, reduced work-related injury and diseases and promote effective and timely return to work for workers who are injured or become ill due to work. Second, a series of comparative and cross-national studies on the health effects of availability of, and the nature of, work will be conducted. This research builds on previous scholarship that found that the negative association between unemployment and health was smaller in societies with greater economic and social supports for unemployed workers. It will examine a broader range of work experiences and health outcomes across a set of high-income countries that have different ways of organizing and structuring their labour market. This research program will advance our understanding of work-related health inequalities in Canada and internationally. It innovates by developing and extending comparative methods and by building and extending data and research partnerships that will have long-standing and practical impact. Its focus in investigating contextual effects across jurisdictions - whether they are institutional or structural aspects or specific policies - will provide evidence on the mechanisms through which we can effectively intervene in improving health in the workplace and in reducing work-related health inequalities."

It is not uncommon for pain diagnoses in residents living with dementia to be dependent on the knowledge and reporting practices of trained staff at their respective nursing homes. Chronic pain is a common problem for many long-term care residents and is experienced by 45-80% of residents. Chronic pain is defined as pain persisting for less than3 months and that has a negative impact on daily life. Chronic pain affects an individual's physical, psychological, social, and spiritual wellbeing. The objective of this research project is to provide a comprehensive assessment of the prescription patterns specific to chronic pain management in LTC residents living with dementia, compared to residents without dementia. Numerous studies have demonstrated that older adults living with dementia experience poor treatment of pain in long-term care. The undertreatment and underassessment of chronic pain is often attributed to the difficulty of older adults living with dementia in communicating their needs. This will be the first research study to investigate prescription patterns related to chronic pain management in Canadian LTC homes. This research can be used by clinicians, nurses, and policymakers to better treat the pain experienced by older adults in long-term care as well as to reduce medication burden and polypharmacy."

Succeeding waves have led to increased levels of depression, anxiety, traumatic symptoms, and burnout among nurses. Staff shortages are now being reported as nurses change units, change workplaces or leave the profession. However, anecdotal reports suggest that enrollment in Canadian nursing programs is higher than it was pre-pandemic. Previous research has shown that new nursing graduates are especially vulnerable to leaving the profession within the first two years following graduation; being thrust into the pandemic working conditions may exacerbate an exodus of these novice nurses. Interviews conducted by our team in the spring of 2020 and 2021 suggest that nurses working in hospitals did not feel prepared to face the mental, social, and physical challenges of working under pandemic conditions. The goal of this project is to create and pilot a training program that will prepare nursing students to work during this pandemic and/or other extreme healthcare crises. The program will consist of 10 training modules combining online content and in-person practice; topics may include trauma, burnout, moral distress, self-care and resiliency, working with racialized patients during COVID, and stigma. Content will be reviewed both by mental health experts, nursing students, and nurses currently working in the field to ensure that it is appropriate to the needs of nurses working under extreme healthcare crises. Both qualitative and quantitative data will be collected to determine the impact of the program on self-efficacy, resiliency, confidence, and knowledge of mental health/coping strategies. The program will also be piloted at partner sites to ensure its utility and applicability across nursing programs. The goal will be to make training materials available to other nursing programs across Canada, and eventually develop online modules for nurses who did not receive this training while in university."

Profitant de partenariats et d'une infrastructure existants, l'objectif principal de ce projet est de produire des données préliminaires sur l'efficacité des témoignages publics des PVVIH. Les objectifs spécifiques sont de rassembler des partenaires communautaires et universitaires qui ont développé une expertise dans le témoignage par les PVVIH, de développer une grille de critères pour évaluer l'efficacité de différents types, approches et pratiques de témoignage et de valider la grille à partir d'exemples de témoignage provenant d'une archive existante. La grille portera sur plusieurs aspects incluant les expériences communiquées, les émotions ressenties, la structure et le vocabulaire utilisés, l'évocation d'une dimension communautaire et le type et la qualité de la réception. Nous anticipons que ce cadre évaluatif permettra d'augmenter la compréhension des impacts du témoignage pour la santé, la qualité de vie, la communication interpersonnelle et le changement social. Le projet fournira une méthode et des outils qui augmenteront le pouvoir d'agir des PVVIH ainsi que les capacités des groupes communautaires et l'efficacité de leurs actions. Lors d'une phase ultérieure, la grille d'évaluation pourrait être appliquée dans plusieurs contextes et milieux de pratique au Québec et au Canada.

Up to 30% of healthcare budgets are spent on potentially unnecessary tests and procedures (e.g. scans, blood transfusions, surgeries), exposing patients to avoidable harm. Our research team has pioneered the development of indicators to assess the underuse of clinical processes in acute injury care. These indicators have been incorporated into provincial and national trauma center accreditation procedures and have led to improvements in clinical processes and decreases in mortality and length of hospital stay. A natural extension of this work, the Canadian Program for Monitoring Overuse in Injury Care, detailed in this proposal, will develop Indicators targeting the use of low-value processes (overuse) in injury care. To do so, we will:

1. Identify low-value processes in injury care
2. Review the evidence base for low-value processes 
3. Develop and validate Indicators to measure the use of low-value processes
4. Identify patient, physician and hospital determinants of overuse and assess its impact on patient mortality, morbidity and resource use
5. Evaluate the impact of disseminating Indicators in a quality report on overuse and patient outcomes. 

The indicators developed in this research program will be used to identify problems of medical overuse in trauma systems across Canada and worldwide. These results will be used by local trauma committees, hospital administrators and trauma system managers to optimize the use of tests and procedures, ultimately reducing the societal and economic burden of injury. Potential benefits include an increase in the efficiency and a decrease in the costs of injury care, an increase in the availability of scarce resources and a reduction in adverse events."

Over the last 3 years we have worked together to summarize the best practices in obesity care. Our team consists of researchers, clinicians, and people with lived experience (i.e., caregivers of children and youth living with obesity). 

The number of children and youth living with obesity has nearly tripled over the last 30 years. Approximately 25-30% of children and youth live with obesity in Canada. Obesity can put children and youth at-risk of developing conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, and mental health conditions (e.g., depression or anxiety). Children and youth who live with obesity may experience stigma and discrimination. This discrimination is also present in healthcare settings.

Obesity is complex, but it is also manageable. In 2006, the first Clinical Practice Guideline was developed to help healthcare providers care for patients with obesity. Since that time, new methods have been developed and new research on how to treat pediatric obesity has arose. It is time to update the Clinical Practice Guideline so we can help healthcare providers better support their patients who live with obesity. We started updating the Clinical Practice Guidelines for Managing Pediatric Obesity in 2019. This new Clinical Practice Guideline will be released this Fall.

We used a Knowledge Translation Planning Template and Dissemination Tool to support the launch of the Clinical Practice Guideline. Our objectives are to design the Clinical Practice Guideline with team members and share the Clinical Practice Guideline with healthcare providers. Working as a team, we will design a variety of tools (e.g., logo, quick guide, series of infographics, video, educational slideshow). These tools will be available in English and French. These tools will be shared on Obesity Canada's website and through their listservs (with over 50,000 members)."

In addition to symptoms of sadness and hopelessness, a loss of interest and motivation, changes in weight, difficulty sleeping and more, depression can also bring on physical problems, as well as social and work-related difficulties.  Depression is often accompanied by anxiety. This is an excessive concern for everything, constant worrying about everything in daily life and difficulty to stop thinking these thoughts. 
The World Health Organization's (WHO) Global Burden Disease (GBD) study quantified and compared the burdens imposed by diseases in terms of disability-adjusted life years1. The GBD study estimated that, world-wide, depression is the single most burdensome illness during the middle years of life. Therefore, depression is a very real concern in the workplace both in the suffering it entails and the economic impact it has on individuals and those close to them and on our Canadian health care system.
      The main objective of this Café is to inform the public of the signs and symptoms of depression and anxiety in the workplace, what to do about it and to reduce the risk of suffering from relapses through treatments both traditional and innovative in their approach. Medication, psychotherapy, as well as stress-reduction techniques will be discussed with experts in their specific area of interest in mental health."

Lung cancer places an especially large burden on Canadians as it is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and more people die of lung cancer than of colon, breast and prostate cancers combined. Prevention can lower the number of new cases of lung cancer but there are few known risk factors for lung cancer beyond smoking. Finding new risk factors for lung cancer is important since not all people who smoke develop lung cancer and up to one in four lung cancers occur in people who have never smoked, suggesting other factors must play a role. There is some evidence that lifestyle, other diseases and medications may play a role in lung cancer development but more research is needed. This study will use already collected data from the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow Project; a group of over 300,000 Canadians from British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Quebec, and Atlantic Canada to identify lifestyle and medical factors that may increase the risk that a person will be diagnosed with lung cancer. Information on risk factors were collected from physical measurements, and questionnaires, including lifestyle (diet, body size, sleep, physical activity), and medical history (diseases, medication use). Development of lung cancer was determined over up to 9 years, during which time more than 1,000 lung cancers were diagnosed. People who were diagnosed with lung cancer will be matched with people of the same age, sex, and smoking history for comparison. People who have never smoked, currently smoke or used to smoke will be studied separately to determine if risk factors differ. This study will provide important information on potential targets for lifestyle changes and strategies to prevent lung cancer with the ultimate goal of improving the lives of the many Canadians affected by this deadly disease."

The COVID-19 pandemic and global uprisings against anti-Black racism led by the Black Lives Matter movement have raised awareness of the lack of concerted policy action to address anti-Black racism and health inequities experienced by Black communities. In Canada, this has been accompanied by debates on the collection and use of data on health and social outcomes by racial identity (race-based data). These debates offer contesting views on the value of race-based data, what the presence or absence of this data does, and the role data may play in policy making.  Calls for race-based data reflect ideas of evidence-informed policy making which generally suggests that evidence of problems and solutions are needed to drive policy decisions. However, current evidence on health inequities has not led to significant policy action. As such, previous research has called for a greater focus on the role of power, politics and ideology in policymaking. Using critical race theory, I will research the relationships between evidence on racial health inequalities and policymaking in public health in this changing policy context. I will interview policy makers, researchers and Black health organizations and social movements, and analyse policy documents (British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec) to examine how race, anti-Black racism and racial health inequities are constructed in public health policymaking in Canada. In doing so, I will explore how the proofs of racial inequities (race-based data) that evidence-informed policy making demands may be tool to hide the lack of policy action to eliminate racial health inequities created by anti-Black racism. My research will provide insight on how to influence policy change to reduce and eliminate the profound racial inequities that exist in social life with direct and fatal impacts on health."

Dopaminergic neurons play an important role in voluntary movements and other behaviours. The symptoms include problems with movement and with memory. The exact cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, but evidence suggests an interaction between environmental and genetic factors. One gene that could potentially be involved is the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene. This gene is responsible for the synthesis of the BDNF protein which is involved in the survival of dopaminergic neurons. Some variations of the gene are linked to reduced production of BDNF. Therefore, these gene variants may play a role in the loss of dopaminergic neurons associated with Parkinson's disease.

Currently, public health recommended behavioural measures, such as handwashing and physical distancing, are the only effective approach to prevent COVID-19. However, COVID-19 exerts a disproportionate impact on marginalized populations. Existing disparities in health and its social determinants increase vulnerability to COVID-19, and creates barriers to adopting public health measures, which deepen resulting inequities. LGBT+ populations, including intersections with other forms of marginalization by race/ethnicity, gender, age and HIV status, experience extensive health disparities, and challenges due to unstable housing, employment, healthcare discrimination, and violence. Yet, there are no coordinated pandemic responses to address the expectable excess burden of COVID-19 among diverse LGBT+ people in Canada or LMIC. Community-engaged approaches are essential to bridging mistrust and loss of confidence in public health communications on the part of vulnerable communities, fueled by existing inequities.

To address substantial gaps in the pandemic response, we will rapidly mobilize our existing global research team to adapt, test, and disseminate a community-engaged, brief, online peer-delivered intervention (#SafeHandsSafeHearts) with diverse LGBT+ populations to reduce risk in the pandemic. We will test the intervention's effectiveness in increasing COVID-19 knowledge and protective behaviours, and reducing psychological distress among cisgender gay/bisexual men, cisgender lesbian/bisexual women, and transgender people in Canada, India, and Thailand. In addition to immediate impact in slowing the spread of COVID-19, results will inform health system and public health responses to support engagement of LGBT+ and other marginalized populations in the pandemic response."

En termes de coûts pour la société, la DC coûte plus cher que les maladies du cœur, le diabète ou le cancer et en 2019, Santé Canada estimait son fardeau économique annuel à 38,3-40,4 milliards $ en termes de coûts directs (soins de santé) et indirects (perte de productivité). Chez les personnes vivant avec de DC, la polypharmacie (souvent définie comme l'utilisation concomitante de 5 médicaments ou plus) constitue la règle plutôt que l'exception. En effet, le traitement de la douleur nécessite souvent la combinaison de différents types de traitements pharmacologiques (ex. antiinflammatoires, opioïdes, antidépresseurs, etc.). Cependant, le risque d'effets indésirables lié à l'usage de plusieurs médicaments n'est pas toujours proportionnel au nombre de médicaments utilisés. Ce projet vise à utiliser une approche novatrice de modélisation de la polypharmacie sous forme de trajectoires de risque d'effets indésirables afin d'apprécier pleinement la variabilité des profils polypharmaceutiques des personnes participantes. Nous allons d'abord modéliser et décrire les différents types de trajectoires de risque chez les personnes vivant avec de la DC; puis documenter à quel point l'appartenance à ces différentes trajectoires influence la condition clinique des personnes participantes (ex. santé perçue); enfin, identifier les facteurs (ex. sexe, genre, comorbidités, etc.) qui caractérisent l'appartenance aux trajectoires de risque.

Look Before Leaping: Considerations for evaluating population health interventions,"['Nickel, Nathan C']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1285.0,346936,"Pathways to Health Equity for Children (""PATHS Equity"") is a research program focused on evaluating the impact that policies and programs have on child health and development. PATHS Equity is also looking at whether these programs helped close the gap in health and development outcomes between children from high and low income families. PATHS Equity evaluated the impact several programs had on child health including (1) The Healthy Baby Prenatal Benefit which provides a monthly cheque to low income pregnant women worth $81.00, (2) The Families First Home Visit program which sends paraprofessional home visitors into the home to support vulnerable families with young children, and (3) Full-Day Kindergarten which provided a full day in school to children enrolled in kindergarten. 
It is often hard to untangle whether or not a program had a real impact on child health in the real world; many other things could explain observed improvements. The PATHS Equity team took two steps to try to figure out whether improvements were likely to be real programmatic effects. Our first step when evaluating each program was to compare groups of children who received the program with groups of children who did not receive the program who were similar on several factors such as age, income, the mother's age, and many other risk factors. We tested to make sure that our groups were, in fact, comparable on these characteristics. The second step we took was another analysis which allowed us to ask the question , ""How likely is it that these statistically significant associations are due to a program effect versus being due to unmeasured confounding?"" In the case of Full-Day Kindergarten, we found that although there were statistically significant improvements associated with the program, these improvements were likely artifacts of unmeasured confounding and not due to any real program effect."

Despite the fact that most are discharged from the hospital alive, many still suffer afterwards. Previous studies have found that  58% of people hospitalized with ACS do not return to work 3 months after discharge and almost one third (30%) still report frequent painful angina and diminished quality of life 6 months after discharge. Unfortunately, there is little information about how patients' quality of life changes over the 6 months after discharge from the hospital. This study will explore changes in quality of life after a heart attack and identify distinct groups of patients with unique patterns of recovery. Further, this study will describe the factors that predict these particular changes, and explore the association between pattern types and adverse outcomes. The emerging science of trajectory analysis offers rich insights into the duration and progression of individual patients' prospects. Moreover, trajectory analysis allows us to determine predictors of future trajectories. We will examine both patient-level and neighborhood-level predictors of health-related quality of life after ACS. This study is the first to systematically examine the relationship between neighborhood-level socio-economic status and quality of life after ACS, which might reveal underlying disparities in quality of life for patients with ACS. Moreover, understanding predictors of trajectories would allow patients, caregivers, and care providers to anticipate and address changing needs, thereby possibly preventing future adverse clinical events thereby opening the way for research on future patient and policy-level interventions to improve quality of life after ACS."

The provision of a safe and regulated supply of pharmaceutical-grade drugs is a necessary response to a growing national public health crisis. A number of novel prescribed safe supply programs have recently been initiated, the majority of which are operating in BC and Ontario. However, the rollout of prescribed safe supply is highlighting the limitations of prescriber-led programs. People who use drugs caution that controlled dispensing models risk overburdening clients, and clinicians have raised concerns about the appropriateness of having prescribers deliver a public health intervention. There is a need for greater diversity of safe supply programs and dispensing models. Despite significant investment in the medical model, no research has been conducted on the fit of primary care, or of other potential dispensing models, to deliver safe supply. This study responds by conducting research with policy and practice implications on the limitations and strengths of the current medical model and of potential alternate dispensing models in BC and Ontario. Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, it seeks to identify policy, clinical, regulatory, social-structural, and systems-level factors that facilitate and hinder the uptake, implementation, and delivery of safe supply. Findings will inform model innovation and enhance relevance, usability, and sustainability in existing programs and be of special interest to Canadian governments and jurisdictions considering safe supply."

While home environments can be easily adapted to changes in one's unique needs, an overhaul of shared public spaces within our cities would require leadership and policy change from our governments - a challenge to implement unless sufficient evidence is provided. In outdoor spaces, pedestrian street crossing is a particularly challenging task for many older adults and persons with impairments. This is due in part to the physical design of the intersection and/or signaling features. These challenges are worsened during winter, as the accumulation of ice, snow and slush can create slippery conditions which impact safety and create physical barriers for ambulatory individuals and wheelchair users. The objective of our research is to understand and address current barriers to safety and accessibility at pedestrian street crossings, with a specific emphasis on winter travel. Focus groups with different user groups representing older adults, and persons with mobility, visual and hearing deficits, will be conducted to identify current barriers to accessibility and safety at intersections. We will then present innovative solutions to address the identified features of concern, to be constructed and evaluated in our simulation winter lab. In this manner, we will be able to uniquely evaluate the impact of each modified feature of the intersection individually and as part of a ""whole"" design. Our results will define a new standard for pedestrian crossings, addressing barriers to community mobility in winter. Our team will work with cities and policy makers to inform transportation standards and propose changes that reflect more suitable intersection designs for Canada's four-season climate.

As governments, researchers and the public contemplate policy reform, there is an urgent need to ensure that residents and family carers can meaningfully engage in policy and service design. User engagement initiatives refer to involving people with lived experience in service or policy development. While some mechanisms to support user engagement in LTC facilities exist, such as resident and family councils, advisory committees, and consumer groups, it is unknown how these forums promote user engagement. My postdoctoral research will address this research gap through an ethnographic study examining how policies and institutional practices facilitate and constrain user engagement in LTC. Using a combination of document analysis, semi-structured interviews, and participant observation, I will explore the extent to which current mechanisms for user engagement enable residents and carers to exercise their rights and influence change. First, I will conduct a document analysis of LTC policies and legislation to examine how residents and their rights are portrayed in document materials. Next, I will interview stakeholders involved in user engagement within LTC, health services and community organizations to examine user engagement practices and constraints. Finally, I will conduct participant observation with family and resident councils in two LTC facilities to explore the experiences of residents and carers attempting to influence change. To enhance the relevancy of the research, the study will be guided by a knowledge user advisory committee made up of residents and carers. This research will support an in-depth understanding of the factors that shape user engagement in LTC and inform the development of user engagement initiatives that promote the rights of residents and family carers."

We conducted a pilot study where we measured four features of entranceways along a busy outdoor shopping area in Edmonton. We found that only 4% of the doors met accessible building standards. A lack of accessibility can lead to isolation and exclusion. Municipal governments can support the inclusion of all people by improving urban accessibility (e.g., the City of Edmonton's Accessibility for People with Disabilities Policy). How to do this fully, and in a way that supports the diverse needs of disable persons, is unclear. Research in the area has focused on accessible public transportation and the use of artificial intelligence or crowd-sourced information. These are key, but they do not get at the experience of accessibility. Understanding experiences will guide municipalities on how to better meet the diverse needs of disabled persons. 

With the funding from the grant we will build a research team that includes the City of Edmonton, local dis/ability advocacy organizations, and people with lived experience of dis/ability. Together, we will create a research project on equitable urban accessibility that highlights the diverse experiences and priorities of disabled persons. Having individuals with lived experiences of dis/ability on the team and part of the research planning will provide vital insight and guidance to ensure the process and resulting project align with their needs. The support we receive through this grant will help us to build strong research partnerships and a project that has the potential to advance urban accessibility in Edmonton and beyond. We would share lessons learned and provide an example of how to improve accessibility in cities, which could have an impact across Canada and internationally."

Understanding risk early on will allow us to intervene and change trajectories. The transition into adult roles is thought to be central to shaping future problems with alcohol. We know that alcohol misuse is synonymous with the undergraduate years, but that most young adults mature out of problem drinking when they graduate. We also know that those who drink to cope are less likely to mature out. The goal of the proposed project is to investigate predictors of coping-motivated drinking. We aim to understand who is at risk of not maturing out of problem drinking when they leave university. Drawing on personality and cognitive theories, we hypothesize unique risk pathways for those high in anxiety and depression. Further, we hypothesize that these effects will influence the likelihood of maturing out, despite the roles individuals transition into (e.g., marriage, parenthood) and despite a family history of alcohol risk. This project will also explore how the use of currently available mental health services impacts alcohol risk. A 6-year, 8-wave longitudinal study is proposed (N=340). This is a two-site study (Concordia University, York University). Undergraduates will complete baseline clinical assessments in the year prior to graduation. At 6-month (Year 2-3) and then annual intervals (Year 4-5), participants will complete assessments online and by smartphone (2-week diaries). In Year 6, clinical assessments will be re-administered. Unique to this study is the truly prospective design and the use of daily diaries to collect real-time mood and alcohol use data. Transitioning out of university is inherently stressful. For those high in anxiety and depression, this may be a time when patterns of problem drinking are solidified, and when risk for alcohol use disorder emerges. This research may influence how we think about, and thus intervene in, heavy drinking during periods of transition."

Since 1990s, the Canadian Criminal Justice System became involved in cases of perceived HIV exposure and/or transmission, prosecuting persons living with HIV for engaging in behaviors deemed ""risky"" in terms of possible HIV transmission. Canada continues to enforce these laws despite evolving scientific evidence on HIV transmission and the lack of empirical evidence to demonstrate that HIV-related case laws are effective at preventing HIV transmission. The African, Caribbean, and Black (ACB) communities are disproportionately burdened by HIV and HIV-related criminal laws.

Although Canada maintains relatively high rates of childhood immunization, recent vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks have been linked to unvaccinated and under-vaccinated individuals who frequently live in geographical clusters and thereby compromise herd immunity. 
Vaccine outreach efforts often rely on implicit assumptions that in order to be convinced the public simply requires education regarding the benefits and safety of vaccines. However, recent research suggests that vaccine hesitancy is not a matter of faulty risk communication and perception. Rather, it is in part a consequence of a break-down in trust relationships between key actors and publics, which might explain why previous vaccine outreach efforts have not succeeded in lowering rates of vaccine hesitancy. Public deliberation is a promising way to understand the concerns of parents regarding vaccines and find reasonable means for addressing them together with those key stakeholders. Public deliberation has several advantages: it creates possibilities for dialogue (vs. one-directional information flow); it facilitates in-depth consideration of issues (vs. off-the-cuff responses); and it enables explicit consideration of competing social values among participants. We propose to design, implement, and evaluate a public deliberation process on vaccine hesitancy in Ontario. Our team is multi-disciplinary, drawing on expertise in psychology, philosophy, applied ethics, history, and public health. We involve key policy actors to ensure a focus on relevant issues and to facilitate uptake of recommendations developed by the public deliberation.

While mental health issues in older populations are well documented globally, relatively little research and services focus specifically on mental wellness in older Aboriginal adults. This is a problem because in addition to typical causes of mental health concerns in older adults (e.g., lack of purpose, isolation, poverty) the history of residential schools in Canada has been linked to worse mental health among Aboriginal Canadians. Our community partner, the Ki-Low-Na Friendship Society, emphasized the need for mental health support in this population, not only for affected individuals but also to heal the community. Existing mental health services may not be successful in helping Aboriginal peoples because they do not address their needs. Research indicates that incorporating Aboriginal worldviews and values into the design of mental health services may improve their use in urban areas. A study will be conducted in a mid-sized urban centre in interior British Columbia to explore mental health concerns to better understand the experience of mental health and wellness.

To facilitate sharing of the knowledge gained, this knowledge translation project will include 2 main objectives: inclusion of community members in research on mental wellness for Aboriginal adults (aged 50+) and sharing the results of the research. Activities will include: a Kick-off event to include community members and gather their input on the study; creation of 2 videos to share the stories of adults 50+ with mental health concerns; and 2 Wrap-up events to share results and videos with community members and health care providers. We will also share results in an academic journal and conference. The results of this research and sharing activities will assist in providing better understanding and care for Aboriginal adults 50+ with mental health concerns."

It occurs when microorganisms evolve to resist the effects of antimicrobial drugs, making them difficult or impossible to treat. As a result, antibiotics and other antimicrobial agents become less effective, leading to increased morbidity and mortality. According to global estimates, approximately 4.9 million deaths each year are associated with antimicrobial resistance, with 1.3 million deaths directly linked to resistant infections. In Canada, as in many other part of the world, antimicrobial resistance is a significant problem, with more than one-quarter of all bacterial infections resistant to at least one antibiotic in 2018. To address this issue, the proposed research will focus on two bacterial pathogens of public health concern: Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium responsible for tuberculosis, and Mycoplasma genitalium, a sexually transmitted infection. Both are difficult to treat related to their association with antibiotic resistance. Leveraging the power of genomics and bioinformatics (using computational tools to analyze biological data), the proposed research will focus on improving the detection and treatment of antimicrobial resistance in these bacteria. Specifically, we will develop new methods to read the genetic information of the bacteria directly from patient samples, instead of waiting for the bacteria to grow in a lab, which can take weeks to months. We will also create bioinformatics pipelines, i.e., a series of computer code and programs, that can use genetic data to rapidly detect genes and mutations that make the bacteria resistant to antibiotics. These efforts will ultimately contribute to improving the identification and treatment of these difficult-to-treat bacterial infections, which are a significant public health concern."

Ultimately, my research will provide valuable insights into reducing the economic impact of COVID-19 in Canada by identifying services that may be at risk of virus transmissions as against total lockdown of services which has ripple effects on economy and leads to limited access to medical treatments of unrelated COVID-19 diseases."
Assessing cognitive function:  A scoping review,"['Olson, Karin L', 'Steggles, Shawn', 'Farmer, Anna P', 'Kolb, Bryan E', 'Slater, Linda G']","['Fielding, Scott D']","['Assessment', 'Cancer', 'Chemotherapy', 'Cognitive Function', 'Scoping Review']",45815.0,184855,"Researchers estimate that between 16% and 75% of individuals receiving chemotherapy report a decline in their cognitive function (CF). These changes have been difficult to detect using standard approaches. The difficulty in detecting declines in CF concerns cancer patients and decision for several reasons. Declines in CF have been associated with fatigue and other symptoms and may also compromise the ability to adhere to treatment requirements, to make informed treatment-related decisions, and to manage work-related activities. 

Reviews of the studies of declines in CF in individuals receiving chemotherapy for cancer have highlighted several important problems.  First, some researchers used tools which had not been checked to ensure that they provided consistent results (were reliable) or actually measured CF, rather than some other problem (were valid). Second, the scope of studies that did use reliable and valid tests was limited to people with breast  cancer. Third, many of the tests for measuring CF take a long time to complete, so it is hard to fit them into a busy clinic setting. This study is the first phase of a two-part project to address these problems. In this phase, we will determine whether there is enough literature on CF assessment using reliable and valid tests to conduct a more detailed review of it. We will examine studies in both the cancer and the non-cancer literature for approaches that have worked well in other populations that may not have been tried with cancer patients. We will also look for studies that address the time required to complete each test, and any special training or equipment requirements. 

The availability of valid and reliable approaches for CF assessment will open a whole new area of research related to the prevention and management of CF changes that would be expected to result in a better understanding of the treatment options, informed decision making and improved quality of life."
Protecting children from unhealthy food and brand marketing in the digital age: A novel artificial intelligence system to assess food and brand marketing on digital media,"['Olstad, Dana Lee', 'Lee, Joon']","['Elliott, Charlene D', 'Prowse, Rachel', 'Yu, Yaoliang']","['Artificial Intelligence', 'Children', 'Data Science', 'Marketing', 'Nutrition', 'Policy', 'Unhealthy Food']",625770.0,401996,"Background: Unhealthy food/brand marketing has a negative impact on what children eat and on their health. Canada will soon ban marketing unhealthy foods/brands to children <13 years old on television, the internet and other media. However, very little is known about the amount and types of unhealthy food/brand ads that children see online and the government does not have a way to monitor whether companies are obeying the new law. The problem is that public health has fallen behind technologically. Marketers are using artificial intelligence (AI), but public health is still relying on humans to try to find out what marketers are doing. Goals: We will develop and test the first AI system that can assess the amounts and types of food/brand marketing that is online. We will use the system to assess differences in the amount and type of food/brand marketing that is online from before to after Canada's new marketing ban comes into effect. We will also study whether companies are obeying the new law. Methods: We will use AI to identify food/brand marketing on Canadian websites, gaming applications and YouTube videos. AI will also be used to: 1) rate the healthfulness of the foods/brands that are being marketed; 2) assess the types of marketing strategies that are being used; and 3) determine whether marketing targets children. AI and marketing experts will test our system to make sure it is accurate. We will conduct statistical testing to understand how the amount and type of marketing changes from 12 months before to 12 months after Canada's marketing ban is implemented, and whether companies are obeying the new law. Significance: This AI system will provide the first scientific evidence about the amount and type of unhealthy food/brand marketing that Canadian children may see online. It will also provide a way to study whether companies are obeying the Canadian government's marketing ban. This information can help to understand how to improve child nutrition and health."
"Does the British Columbia Farmers' Market Nutrition Coupon Program improve the diet quality and food security of parents and children with low incomes? A dose-response, pragmatic randomized controlled trial","['Olstad, Dana Lee', 'Campbell, David J', ""O'Hara, Heather"", 'Sajobi, Tolulope T', 'Spackman, Eldon']","['Leblanc, Peter', 'McCormack, Gavin R', 'Minaker, Leia', 'Radin Pereira, Leticia Cristin']","['Adult Health', 'Child Health', 'Diet Quality', ""Farmers' Markets"", 'Financial Subsidy', 'Food Insecurity', 'Low-Income Households', 'Parent-Child Dyads', 'Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial', ""Women'S Health""]",940950.0,501762,"Background: In British Columbia (BC), 16.2% of households cannot afford to buy enough food. This is called household food insecurity. The BC Farmers' Market Nutrition Coupon Program (FMNCP) is trying to reduce food insecurity and improve people's diets by giving low-income households coupons to buy healthy foods in farmers' markets. In a previous study, we found that the FMNCP reduced household food insecurity, but it did not improve the diet quality of adults. We think this is because parents used the money to buy food for their children and not for themselves. The FMNCP may need to give households more money to buy enough food for parents and their children. Goals: We will do a randomized controlled trial to study the impact of three higher healthy food subsidies, compared to the usual FMNCP subsidy, on the diet quality, food insecurity and other health-related outcomes of 380 parent-child pairs. Methods: 380 low-income households will be randomly put into a group that gets the usual FMNCP subsidy of $27/household/week or a group that gets a subsidy that is 1.5 ($40.50/household/week), 2 ($54/household/week) or 2.5 times ($67.50/household/week) higher. Participants will get 16 weeks of coupons that they can spend over 26 weeks. They can also attend optional food skills education. We will collect information from one parent (18-64 years) and one child (6-12 years) in each household about what they eat, their food insecurity, and other health-related outcomes. This information will be collected at baseline (0 weeks), midway through (13 weeks) and at the end of the intervention (26 weeks). We will also calculate whether the four subsidies are cost-effective. Significance: This will be the first study to examine how different doses of a healthy food subsidy affect what parents and their children eat and their food insecurity. It will help governments to know how much money low-income households need to buy enough healthy food for parents and children."
Agricultural Exposure and Asthma Severity and Phenotypes among Children in Saskatchewan,"['Oluwole, Oluwafemi']",['N/A'],"['Agricultural Exposures', 'Asthma', 'Asthma Phenotypes', 'Asthma Severity', 'Child Health', 'Diagnostic Validity', 'Epidemiology', 'Lung Function Testing', 'Public Health', 'Rural Health']",150000.0,297815,"For unknown reasons, the prevalence and severity of childhood asthma are increasing. Urbanization, lifestyle changes, and higher exposure to certain environmental agents are thought to play a role. Despite recent asthma trends, studies have reported a lower rate of occurrence among rural children, especially those living on farms compared to urban children. However, recent studies have suggested that rural children are more likely to report more severe asthma than urban children and that farming exposures are associated with worse lung health outcomes among those with asthma. As such, additional research is needed to identify the role of environmental exposures in rural areas in relation to lung health outcomes, an understudied area. I will investigate agricultural exposures and diagnostic patterns in relation to asthma severity and phenotypic expression among children from a large urban, small urban, and rural area in Saskatchewan. The study will specifically answer the following questions: 1) Are there differences in asthma diagnostic patterns between rural and urban children? 2) Are there variations in asthma phenotypes between rural and urban children and do agricultural exposures contribute to these differences? 3) Are there variations in asthma severity between rural and urban children and do agricultural exposures contribute to these differences? Data collection for the study will include an asthma validation phase and an objective environmental and biological assessment phase. Results from the study will help describe the differences in asthma phenotypic expression and asthma severity between urban and rural settings, and further enhance knowledge on the role of agricultural-farming environment in the etiology of asthma. The results will also help to identify which groups of children are at increased risk of poor lung health outcomes and will be a helpful tool for planning asthma care in children, particularly those living in rural Canada."
Watersheds as a Conceptual Framework for the Study of SDGs' Interactions and Health Outcomes,"['Onabola, Christiana O']",['N/A'],"['Biodiversity And Ecosystem Services Assessment', 'Health Equity Outcomes (Humans And Biodiversity)', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Participatory-Research Approach', 'Planetary Health Research (Watersheds, Systems-Thinking)', 'Population Health Research', 'Sequential Explanatory Design, Mixed-Methods', 'Social And Environmental Determinants  Of Health', 'Socio-Ecological Interactions, Interactions Among The Sdgs', 'Spatial Data And Spatial Analysis, Gis, Case Study']",150000.0,415936,"""This research respectfully involves Indigenous communities""

My research uses watersheds - their ranks, sizes, boundaries, latitudes and spaces - as units of analysis to track difficult-to-detect human and environmental health outcomes and challenges arising from interactions among the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A watershed nests diverse human and biodiversity ecosystems (markets, industries, firms, farmlands, farmers, schools, regulations, government institutions, operating policies, species populations, etc.). Like its diverse ecosystems, a watershed crosses local, regional, national or international boundaries. It has characteristics such as size, area, rank, boundary, location, latitude, and space that help us to better understand nested communities, populations and interactions within the ecosystems. These include: how they exist, where they live, how they interact with one another, including nature, extent and scale of these interactions, and how to plan and distribute resources to support planetary ecosystems. 

I consider that watersheds can impart these characteristics to the SDGs, which were put together to make our world healthier. My research will use case studies of selected watersheds in Canada and Nigeria. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and spatial analysis methods, I will adopt watersheds as natural boundaries to obtain denominator data that will reflect human and environmental health challenges in communities that often go un-reflected, unreported and monitored. Using watershed boundaries to show a side-by-side overlay of clusters of cases of specific SDGs interactions will help determine the geographical extent and scale at which these clusters occur in relation to populations at risk; while displaying multiple, rather than restricted, views of the distribution of health outcomes. This will facilitate inclusive monitoring of health outcomes and reduce health inequities that often abound in the least and farthest communities."

We have learned that M-AY live their lives concurrently in multiple places that include northern communities and lands, and southern cities. Time spent in each varies with circumstances and each is associated with specific needs and supports. Regardless of where they are M-AY strongly aspire to maintain connections to ancestral lands, culture, family, and community. This aspiration is enacted through placemaking, especially walking with the land. Multilocality has been revealed as an emerging critical yet neglected dimension of research on aging well in place across the life course. This study will focus on the lived experience of multilocality for NSK M-AY that encompasses an NSK Métis community, the surrounding homelands, and the city of Saskatoon 500km to the south. Centered in Breath of Life Theory & Ecological Framework, health equity, and Métis methods, we will kehokatowin (visit one another) in all three locations to uncover how multilocality shapes experiences and aspirations for wellbeing and identify interventions, along with facilitators and barriers to access, that support well-being. Data will be drawn from interviews, stories, participant observation, and other measures at large gatherings, in homes, communities, and on the land. Provider and stakeholder interviews and monitoring of public social media and bulletin boards will identify existing interventions and services. Anticipated outcomes: (i) narratives of multilocality-informed wellness in place(s); (ii) integration of multilocality in a community-developed Métis health and wellness framework; and (iii) and an annotated directory of interventions supporting multilocal well-being.

The Anatomy of Adherence: How Gender and The Body Structure HIV Positive Poly-Substance Using People's Relationships to HIV Medications,"['Orchard, Treena R', 'Hogg, Robert S']","['Corneil, Trevor A', 'Michelow, Warren D', 'Moore, David M', ""O'Brien, Nadia"", 'Palmer-Fluevog, Alexis', 'Parashar, Surita', 'Schilder, Arn J']","['Adherence', 'Gender', 'Health And Social Services', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Poly-Substance Using Populations', 'Qualitative Methodology', 'The Body']",100000.0,215404,"Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has transformed HIV/AIDS from a fatal disease to a chronic illness that can be managed over the long term, but this depends on consistently taking at least 95% of prescribed HAART doses; i.e. achieving 95% or better 'adherence'. Most adherence research examines the degree to which patients follow their physician's instructions but few consider how patients understand medical information and incorporate it into their daily lives and personal health care practices. In the biomedical model the impact of HAART on the body is understood through white blood cell counts and the amount of the HIV virus in the blood. For HIV-positive patients, their bodies as a whole suffer the impacts of being on HAART. Very few studies have explored the personal ways that HIV-positive patients relate to and manage how they take their HAART, or how they factor in what's happening with their bodies. This is even truer for marginalized HIV-positive people, such as those who are drug users, who also have to deal with being addicted, living in poverty or even being homeless. We already know that women and men have differing levels of success with good adherence--especially among drug users--but there is little research on how gender itself plays into decisions about taking HIV medications and how the factors that patients consider might be different for or be seen differently by women and transgendered people compared with men. Our study will take a qualitative approach to answering these questions by interviewing 90 women, men who have sex with men, and transgendered people. We will also interview 40 health/social service providers about how they encourage adherence among their HIV-positive clients who use drugs. Our findings will inform strategies to improve adherence that more closely reflect how vulnerable HIV-positive people use and think about their bodies as they manage their medical regimes and the challenges of everyday life with HIV."
Cannabis and mental health: understanding the needs of educational interventions tailored to LGBTQ2+ youth,"['Ortiz Paredes, David F']",['N/A'],"['Cannabis', 'Health Education', 'Lgtbq2+ Health', 'Mental Health', 'Mixed Methods']",105000.0,476271,"Youth who identify as sexual and gender minorities (SGM) have higher rates of cannabis use compared to their non-SGM counterparts. Problematic cannabis use is associated with multiple mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety. As such, cannabis use among SGM youth is a significant public health challenge, given that they are already at increased risk for mental health issues due to stigma. However, literature on the needs of SGM youth regarding cannabis-related health education is extremely limited. 
This doctoral research project aims to explore how SGM youth seek information about cannabis and determine their needs for educational interventions regarding cannabis use and its mental health effects.
This doctoral research will have two phases. Phase #1: SGM youth (n=30) who use cannabis regularly will participate in individual interviews to discuss their knowledge of cannabis and its mental health effects. To help the flow of the conversation and enrich the information, participants will also draw pictures representing how they obtain information. Interviews will be analyzed, looking for patterns across them. Phase #2: The results from phase #1 will inform the development of an online survey to determine the needs of SGM youth regarding cannabis-related health education interventions. The survey will be administered to 1500 SGM youth who use cannabis regularly and reside in Quebec. 
This study will inform the development of evidence-informed health education interventions related to cannabis that are tailored to SGM youth. This information is necessary for addressing the existing cannabis-related health inequities between SGM and non-SGM youth. This study will provide critical information on how to better support healthier cannabis use through education and thus support prevention efforts of problematic cannabis use among SGM youth."

The sentinel features of ADHD are hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention. The main goal of this project is to better understand the relationship between ADHD features and increased driving risk. More specifically, we examine if ADHD hyperactivity/impulsivity features are most associated with risky driving and if ADHD inattention features are most associated with inattention while driving. A precise understanding of the pathways to driving risk in ADHD could help identify targeted interventions to reduce that risk."

Men and women dependent on opioids find extremely difficult to stop using them.  They continue using these drugs, with intervening periods of treatment, no drug use and relapse, despite the negative consequences; this chronic illness poses great harms to the individual, her/his family and the community. Thus, women and men affected by this condition for many years are often considered by the health care system to be hard- to- reach and hard- to- treat. Studies show that men and women are affected differently by many illnesses, including addiction. These differences have tremendous implications for the provision of care for men and women struggling with drugs. We will simultaneously look at the role of gender with drug use patterns (e.g., frequency, quantity), victimization (e.g., history of physical or sexual abuse, intimate partner violence), physical and mental health problems (e.g., HIV, depression), and the impact of these factors on treatment access within an urban Canadian setting. This is fundamental as these findings will help us understand the complex role of gender and how this can inform the provision of effective addiction treatment services for opioid dependent men and women. This will thereby reduce the difficulty in reaching and treating this group of Canadians, and improve their overall health. The findings of this study will also influence Canada's health research, clinical practice, and policy, by making recommendations for improving access to treatment and designing innovative feasible interventions."
Patient-Centered Care for Addictions Treatment: A Scoping Review,"['Oviedo-Joekes, Eugenia', 'Harrison, Scott']","['MacDonald, Donald S', 'Westfall, Jordan', 'Marchand, Kirsten I', 'Marsh, David C', 'Schechter, Martin T']","['Harm Reduction', 'Opioid Dependency', 'Patient-Centered Care', 'Rehabilitation', 'Treatment']",58070.0,378583,"In the midst of the current national opioid-related overdose crisis, there is an urgent need to improve treatment options for people with opioid dependence. Presently, the evidence-base for opioid dependence treatment is weighted towards treatments that medically manage opioid craving and withdrawal symptoms (e.g., methadone, buprenorphine). While these treatments have demonstrated effectiveness, there is still great variability in their rate of engagement and retention. Thus, a significant portion of the population remains at risk of overdose. 

We propose that a patient-centered approach to opioid dependency treatment could optimize these treatments to meet the diverse needs of this population. Patient-centered care (PCC) prioritizes the unique needs and values of each client. This approach has a longstanding history in the social sciences, and its more recent integration in medicine has shown positive outcomes for people with other chronic conditions. Despite the potential value that PCC could bring to opioid dependency treatment, very little research has explored this concept. 

This knowledge synthesis will apply a scoping review methodology to examine the extent and nature of existing evidence for PCC in the broader field of addictions research and clinical practice. The specific research question to be asked is: what patient-centered care principles and outcomes have been empirically explored and integrated into health care settings for people with substance use and substance dependence? 

The results of this scoping review will provide information that can be used by researchers, policymakers, and healthcare providers to consider the potential benefits and feasibility of integrating PCC into opioid dependency treatment. Ultimately, a patient-centered approach has the potential to improve client engagement, retention and satisfaction with opioid dependency treatment."
Role of sexual orientation in mental health and service utilization in Canada,"['Pakula, Basia']",['N/A'],"['Mental Health', 'Service Utilization', 'Sexual Orientation', 'Sexuality', 'Youth']",105000.0,258473,"Background: Numerous surveys have shown that lesbian, gay and bisexual (LBG) people report poorer mental health, including greater victimization, depression, stress, anxiety, substance use, and suicide, compared to non-LGB people. Suggested explanations for these inequities include exposure to discriminatory behaviour and stigmatization, isolation, low social supports, disclosure reactions, stressful life events, heterosexism, homophobia, and service utilization. Few Canadian studies examine the role of sexual orientation (SO) in mental health and service utilization in Canada. Research objectives & Methods: (1) To critically review and examine existing concepts, theories and measures underlying SO in the context of youth mental health. This work will be guided by (a) comprehensive literature review, informed by the Cochrane methods, and (b) secondary analysis of existing qualitative interviews (N=452, ages 15-29 years) to identify key constructs related to SO and gender identity as described from youth's perspectives. (2) To identify the effect of SO on self-perceived mental health in a nationally representative sample of Canadians. LGB Canadians are hypothesized to have lower perceived mental health compared to their heterosexual counterparts. (3) To examine mental health service utilization patterns in a nationally representative sample of Canadians, and conduct subgroup analyses that compare patterns across SO and gender identity categories. SO is hypothesized to be a significant predictor of mental health service utilization, with LGB youth reporting lower service utilization levels than non-LGB youth.

Additionally, social-structural inequities (e.g. poverty, racism, drug criminalization), colonization, and cultural disruption have heightened vulnerability of Indigenous peoples to HIV infection, with incidence rates 2.7 times higher than people of other ethnicities in Canada. Addressing HIV/AIDS disparities amongst Indigenous populations in Canada has been marked as a clear priority at federal, provincial, and community levels. However, there remains a dearth of opportunity for Indigenous HIV-related research to be shared with academic researchers, community partners, policy makers, and other stakeholders. We aim to address this need by providing a platform at the Canadian Association of HIV Research (CAHR) 2017 conference to build on previous research within Indigenous communities in Canada, and to advance an Indigenous-focused HIV research agenda.

The project will aim to strengthen capacity for intersectoral action to improve water-related determinants of health in northern BC. Prior collaborative work with the Northern Regional Drinking Water Teams and planning the recent BC Water Symposium has identified a combined 'knowledge-push' and 'knowledge-pull' within the proposed project team, expressed by the overarching research question: What can be learned by working together to link knowledge of the health benefits of integrated watershed governance with the experience and practice of intersectoral action for health?

Extensive efforts have been made to keep the public accurately informed of evolving information and public health recommendations. However, variable levels of public trust in both non-pharmaceutical (e.g. masking, hand washing) and pharmaceutical (e.g. vaccination) public health recommendations have been identified. Health Canada has approved several vaccines for COVID-19, and health officials estimate that vaccination in 70-80 percent of the population is required for community immunity (i.e., when most of a population is immune to an infectious disease, providing indirect protection) to be achieved. Understanding the underlying reasons why Canadians are vaccine hesitant within the general public and healthcare workforce is crucial to developing effective approaches to improve levels of vaccine confidence in Canada. In response to this challenge, we propose to co-design, with members of the public, a suite of targeted population level solutions to support public confidence in vaccination for COVID-19. We will achieve this through three overlapping phases of work: Phase I National Survey: design and administration of survey to a representative sample of Canadians and healthcare workers to examine underlying drivers of vaccine hesitancy and confidence, strategies for effective communication of vaccination information, and identification of socio-demographic variations. Phase II: Follow up focus groups within key sub-populations (e.g. sex, age, ethnicity etc.) based on survey findings to develop a richer understanding of contextual factors, and Phase III: Design evidence informed interventions to improve levels of public trust and influence increased rates of vaccination. Interventions will be funnelled into an existing CIHR funded national COVID-19 awareness campaign that is currently being led by our team."
Maternal early life trauma and wheeze in young children: Could there be a connection?,"['Pawlowski, Alicia N']",['N/A'],"['Asthma', 'Childhood Maltreatment', 'Intergenerational Transmission', 'Psychoneuroimmunology', 'Psychosocial Stress']",17500.0,254445,"Psychological stress increases the risk of poor health. It is generally believed that stress creates physiological reactions in the brain which in turn can generate inappropriate immune responses in the body. Chronic stress activates brain pathways normally used only for emergency situations, giving rise to stress reactions to everyday hassles.  New evidence reveals that traumatic events in childhood may result in lifelong difficulties with stress management and poor health outcomes linked to changes in the immune system. It is thought that while the effects of chronic stress are usually not permanent, trauma early in life comes at a critical period, making reprogramming of the stress reaction in the brain difficult. Maternal stress and depression during pregnancy and the postpartum period has been linked to a number of diseases in childhood, including wheeze and asthma. The mother's distress acts like a traumatic event for the infant, encoding the infant's stress reaction in the brain and in turn causing immune related illnesses. Childhood emotional mistreatment has been linked to emotional instability and improperly functioning immune systems. Mothers with a history of childhood trauma may have an especially hard time dealing with the stress of pregnancy and looking after a newborn. Given the critical nature of this period, it seems possible that mothers might pass on the health effects of their childhood traumas to their children in the form of diseases like asthma. Using data from the Community Perinatal Care (CPC) Study, we will investigate if past maternal emotional abuse is associated with wheeze outcomes in preschool children. An association will highlight the potential for maternal psychosocial stress, as a cumulative toxic exposure, to be transmitted between generations. This will emphasize the importance of services aimed at lowering the stress of new mothers and, in particular, the value of inquiring about early life experiences."

Addressing sex and gender in clinical trials and intervention research is critical to enhancing the quality of evidence for clinical and policy decisions. A set of planning activities to support the development of a multi-year program of research proposes to identify and enhance methods to improve the consideration of sex and gender in clinical and intervention trials in relation to cardiovascular diseases:  (1) conduct an on-line stakeholder consultation to assess awareness of sex/gender analysis policies and tools and gather input regarding integration of SGA into their work, and (2) hold a 2-day planning meeting to develop a research proposal for a project grant to improve sex/gender analysis in clinical trials and intervention studies. Outputs from our planning activities will include a proposal for a research grant, summary report for stakeholders, and an open-access manuscript reporting on our findings. The subsequent research proposal will contribute novel evaluative evidence of the influence of policy guidance on sex/gender analysis in clinical and intervention trials in Canada in relation to cardiovascular disease (particularly in women), as well as evidence on barriers to implementation and facilitators to improving the appropriate consideration of sex/gender."

HPV causes almost all cases of cervical cancer and genital warts, as well as anal, vaginal, penile, and oral cancers. While there is no cure for HPV, Health Canada has approved and recommended a safe and effective HPV vaccine for both males and females aged 9-26 years. In Canada, publicly funded school-based HPV vaccine programs are currently available to girls aged 9-13 years. Some provinces offer catch-up programs for girls up to 18 years old. Across Canada, vaccination rates among females vary and are often too low to protect the entire population. Additionally, we do not know vaccine uptake rates in Canadian boys. Parents of boys who wish to obtain the vaccine must assume the cost (approximately 400-500 dollars for 3 doses). Therefore, parents must evaluate many factors (e.g., benefits vs. cost, social influences) before deciding whether or not to vaccinate their sons. We are interested in what parents know about HPV and the HPV vaccine, their attitudes towards the vaccine and which factors influence their decision-making process. First, we will conduct a random Canada-wide online survey of 3500 parents of boys (aged 9-16) to assess knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about the HPV vaccine. Parents will be grouped according to their stage of adoption in the decision-making process. Second, we will conduct a follow-up study one year later to assess whether parents' vaccination decision stage has changed and which factors influenced these changes. Furthermore, the survey data will provide us with an estimate of the most recent uptake rates in young Canadian males. This is one of the first studies that aims to identify the key factors that influence changes in parents' HPV vaccine decisions over time. The results of this study will better inform public health strategies and the development of educational interventions (e.g. pamphlets, videos) to prevent HPV and HPV-related cancers."

We focus on how social disadvantage (e.g., poverty, living in risky neighbourhoods) and the quality of children's family relationships (e.g., positivity/negativity in children's interactions with their parents) influence one another to predict how well children do over time.  

The relationships children have with people around them are a key determinant of their social, emotional and cognitive wellbeing. Understanding what drives these relationships is critical to our ability to support children's optimal development. However, understanding interpersonal relationships is complex because it is currently unclear how much the characteristics of individual children (e.g., a child's level of aggression), the characteristics of people they are interacting with (e.g., their sibling's level of aggression) and the characteristics of the dyad drive the quality of their relationship. In addition, research has shown that once genetic factors are accounted for siblings are very different from one another, despite the fact that they are raised in similar environments. It possible that children elicit different reactions from their environments so that their environments are less similar than one might expect. Or, differences between children may lead them to react differently to their similar environments. 

Disentangling these effects requires rich data that account for genetic, family and social disadvantage. We are requesting funds to build on a large, CIHR funded dataset that provides precisely the kinds of data needed to study these complex questions. It also builds on sophisticated statistical techniques developed by the project team that allow us to make attributions about what sends children on different developmental trajectories using correlational data."

In 2021, new legislation (Bill C-7) removed the requirement that a person's natural death be reasonably foreseeable. This meant that persons living with a mental disorder as the sole underlying condition could also potentially be eligible for MAID (delayed until March 2024). This change in the legislation has resulted in controversy and in morally and clinically complex decision-making for members of the MAID team.

The purpose of this Café is to disseminate evidence-based knowledge of the perspectives and experiences of healthcare providers working with persons requesting and receiving MAID whose natural death is not reasonably foreseeable. The objectives of the Cafe are to 1) provide an overview of the current legislation so that the audience begins from a place of common understanding; 2) present evidence of healthcare providers' experiences from multiple studies; 3) foster conversation between the public and healthcare providers; and 4) engage attendees around research priorities. 

Based upon studies conducted with diverse healthcare providers, presenters will provide an overview of evidence of how healthcare providers experience changing eligibility criteria under C-7, integrate the multi-faceted nature of suffering into MAID assessments, and the factors they consider when deciding to participate in MAID or not. The clinicians on the panel will provide an overview of the current eligibility criteria and share their own experiences with negotiating the new legislation. Participants in the Café will have the opportunity to ask questions of the panel, share their own perceptions and experiences, and suggest further priorities for research. Our goal is to support and exchange of evidence and information that will contribute to an improved climate of openness and trust in the morally complex landscape of MAID."

Ce projet de recherche s'appuiera sur les données d'une grande étude américaine à laquelle ont participé 985 familles ayant donné naissance à des enfants prématurés et de petit poids. Le tiers de ces familles, sélectionnées au hasard, ont reçu des services pendant les trois premières années de vie de l'enfant (visites à domicile, services éducatifs préscolaires de qualité, rencontres de parents). Pendant leur enfance, les enfants du groupe d'intervention et leurs familles ont montré plusieurs gains comparativement à ceux du groupe contrôle, mais ce n'est qu'à l'âge de 18 ans qu'on a aussi noté moins de problèmes de comportement, un phénomène surprenant, mais qu'on a observé dans d'autres études similaires. Ce projet vise donc d'abord à mieux comprendre les mécanismes par lesquels l'intervention précoce parvient à prévenir les problèmes de comportement : est-ce en stimulant le développement cognitif des enfants, en favorisant l'emploi de la mère, ou en améliorant l'environnement familial et les comportements parentaux ? On examinera ensuite s'il existe des différences dans les mécanismes les plus importants pour les garçons et les filles, ou pour les enfants qui présentent différentes caractéristiques. Mieux comprendre comment et pour qui l'intervention précoce permet de prévenir les troubles des conduites permettra de mieux diriger les efforts et les ressources publiques qui y sont consacrés, et ainsi éviter que ces problèmes compromettent la santé de ces jeunes et leurs chances de réussir aux plans social et économique."

During the height of the pandemic, public health leaders and governments required Canadians to stay at home and to maintain social distancing if, and when, they were out. These policies, and the response to them, undoubtedly saved lives. We are unsure however, of how certain COVID-19 policies may have affected other health outcomes. A recent Children First Canada report called ""Raising Canada 2020"" reported that children and youth, as well as those less fortunate, may have suffered more than others as the result of COVID-19 policies. This report also states that preventable injury is the number one threat to children and youth in Canada, and called violence against children the ""hidden crisis"" of the pandemic. In the early days of the pandemic, Kids Help Phone calls in Vancouver increased drastically, as did as the number of reported domestic incidents, sexual assaults, and a rise in reported gun violence in Toronto. Despite this, we do not have data on the number of children and youth affected by violence during the COVID-19 restrictions. Our research project will use several sources of data to better understand how many children and youth suffered a violence-related injury during the pandemic.

The two main purposes of this project are to learn more about how the adjustment of boys exposed to intimate partner violence differs from the adjustment of girls, and to evaluate the effectiveness of a children's treatment program with sensitivity to these differences.  Our emphasis will be on similarities and differences in how boys' and girls' intimate relationships with men and boys influence their health and well-being. Unfortunately, we know very little about how children, especially boys, perceive men in their lives who are violent. We know even less about their positive relationships with men and boys who are not violent, and how these relationships may help them feel healthier now, and also grow up in a healthier way.  Fathers, stepfathers, older brothers, grandfathers and others may strongly influence children exposed in intimate partner violence in many different positive ways. Our goal is to better understand the role these relationships play in children's health and well-being by asking children themselves about their ideas, as well as by measuring a variety of children's health outcomes.

To date, no research has measured the extent, nature and impact of food company sponsorship of sports clubs in Canada nor has any research examined the financial impact of sponsorship on children's access to sports. The perceptions of parents and sports club officials regarding this activity and its restriction are also unknown.

The purpose of this study is to determine the frequency and healthfulness of food company sponsorship of junior sports clubs in Canada, to examine its potential effects on the dietary behaviors of youth and to understand the perceptions of parents and sport club officials regarding this activity. To do so, this study will identify junior sports clubs for the 8 most popular sports among youth (5-17 years) in 7 cities in Ontario and 7 in Quebec. Sports club officials will be interviewed over the phone to identify all food company sponsors and to determine how much funding and other benefits they receive from food company sponsorship. The attitudes of parents and sports club officials regarding food company sponsorship and its restriction will also be assessed using surveys and individual interviews. Finally, surveys and focus groups will be conducted with youth to determine whether sponsorship influences their food purchasing or dietary behaviors and to understand their attitudes toward food sponsors.

Donations of food banks are a well-known attempt to resolve the problem, but not everyone agrees on their benefit. Some think they are part of the problem, because they undermine the movement to adopt policies to fight against poverty. Others see them rather as a bridge to other community services that help people pull through. Who is right?
For now, there is insufficient scientific data available to settle the matter. In a previous study we demonstrated the positive effects of food donation on food safety and on the physical and mental health of those using these community organizations. The results must be confirmed, however, and several questions remain. What is the trajectory of the people who call on these organizations? Do they find the guidance they need to overcome the hardships at the root of
their request for food? In what way? On what conditions? Is the situation different in Montreal, in the periphery, or in rural areas? It is in an attempt to answer these questions that our team proposes to meet, three times over two years, 1,800 new users of 180 community organizations offering food donations in four regions of Quebec (Montreal, Estrie,
Lanaudière, and Mauricie-Centre-du-Québec). Interviews with organization heads and with users with different pathways will help complete the picture. Our team brings together veteran and new researchers, and also 16 organizations intimately familiar with the environments to
be studied. Together, they will communicate their results to practitioners, managers, and decision-makers to improve public and community network planning and intervention practices and to guide public policies on food security."
"The mental health impact and needs of those living with food allergy: Perceptions from children, parents and care providers to inform a needs-based multi-faceted support programs and policy","['Protudjer, Jennifer L', 'Gerdts, Jennifer']","['Abrams, Elissa M', 'Elliott, Susan J', 'Roos, Leslie E', 'Simons, Elinor']","['Children And Youth', 'Food Allergy', 'Mental Health', 'Patient Engagement', 'Policy']",105000.0,415795,"For the 4-8% of Canadian children with food allergy, and thus their families, deciding what and where to eat can be challenging and costly. These decisions can also lead to acute and severe reactions which require emergency medicine. But, because food allergic reactions are potentially fatal, these decisions can also be a potential life-or-death choice. To prevent a reaction, allergic individuals must exclude the foods to which they are allergic. This can be challenging, socially limiting and costly. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms recognizes food allergy as a legal disability. Yet, at present, there are no national policies to support those living with food allergy. To address this knowledge gap, we propose a project that uses data from various sources to increase our understanding of these families' needs. 

Our group includes Canadian leaders in pediatric allergy, knowledge translation, mixed methods and child psychology. Manitoba is the ideal place to do this work because it is a leader in pediatric allergy patient education and engagement, and is home to the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy, which houses health administation data for nearly all registered residents in the province.

The major goal of our work is to describe how food allergy impacts families.  We will learn about this impact by talking to families, medical professionals and school staff, and by analysing healthcare records. Our other major goal is to create a needs-focused pediatric food allergy support programme for low-income Manitoba children and their families. We will use this information to develop the types of programs they believe would be most helpful. 

Our long term vision is to use the findings to help inform a national strategy for families with food allergic children, to help inform decisions for maximising available resources, to provide optimal care for those with food allergy, and to assist with future planning."

This impact is made worse by previously unseen amounts of time spent online, and the sheer amount of misinformation online. For people who live with allergic disease, reports of anaphylactic reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine have contributed to greater vaccine hesitancy. We are planning a project that will lower this hesitancy amongst people with allergic disease, and their healthcare providers. Our project has three goals. First, we will also speak with families with allergy about their concerns related to the vaccine hesitancy. Then, we will regularly review and update the literature on COVID-19 vaccines and allergic reactions. Finally, throughout the study, we will work with families and healthcare providers to widely share knowledge, in ways that are meaningful to those receiving the information. Our research questions are, ""What misinformation exists regarding the risk of COVID-19 vaccine-triggered anaphylaxis?"" and ""What methods and strategies are most appropriate, as determined by families and healthcare providers, to increase vaccine confidence?"" The primary outcomes for Objectives 1 and 2 include risk factors for anaphylaxis, and hesitancy related to the COVID-19 vaccine. The outcomes of Objective 3 include improved access to scientifically-robust information so that families and healthcare providers can make informed decisions. By engaging with families and healthcare providers throughout the project, and partnering with a not-for-profit organization that seeks to reduce the health literacy gap between families and healthcare providers, we will slow the spread of related misinformation and increase vaccine confidence."
Delineating the relationship between arsenic exposure and cancer risk,"['Pullella, Katherine']",['N/A'],"['Arsenic', 'Biomarkers', 'Canadian Cancer Registry', 'Canadian Health Measures Survey', 'Cancer', 'Environmental Health', 'Heavy Metals', 'Population Health', 'Predictors', 'Risk']",105000.0,458884,"Arsenic is an established carcinogen for the skin, bladder and lungs; however, the impact of arsenic exposure on cancer risk at other sites, including the breast, remains inconclusive. Recently, our team found a highly significant, increased risk of breast cancer among women with the highest levels of blood arsenic. This study was conducted in a country with low levels of arsenic exposure, suggesting that even at low doses, arsenic may be an important risk factor for breast, and potentially other cancers. Importantly, the primary source of arsenic within these populations remains unclear. In Canada (and other countries), the impact of arsenic exposure on total and site-specific cancer risk is also unknown. Therefore, the overarching aim of this project is to: (1) identify key predictors of arsenic status, and (2) delineate the overall, and site-specific, cancer risk associated with arsenic exposure, in two populations with low levels of arsenic. To assess the Canadian predictors of arsenic status, exposure data will be extracted from the Canadian Health Measures Survey, and arsenic levels will be quantified using total blood and urinary arsenic biomarkers. A critical, novel linkage to the Canadian Cancer Registry will be performed to ascertain incident cancers for this cohort. Expanding on our previous publication with the International Hereditary Cancer Centre in Poland, the second study will examine predictors of arsenic status in a cohort of 1,702 Polish women. Multivariable regression will be used to determine predictors of arsenic status, and Cox proportional hazards modelling will be used to estimate the association between arsenic levels and cancer risk. Results from this proposal will provide essential insight into key sources of arsenic and validate cancer risk associated with this environmental carcinogen. Ultimately, this information is needed to develop critical population-level intervention strategies to reduce the Canadian, and global burden of cancer."

This activity builds on the work that Canadian weight bias researchers and knowledge users such as the Canadian Obesity Network have been doing for the last five years. Although, researchers and knowledge users have raised awareness of the importance of weight bias in health care, education, and publi policy areas, there is an urgent need to move beyond raising awareness towards creating practice, policy, and social change. Under the umbrella of the Canadian Obesity Network, researchers, people with obesity, and decision makers have decided to form a collaborative (EveryBODY Matters) that will work on strategic research and knowledge translation initiatives to reduce weight bias in Canada. As a first point of action, this collaborative will host a meeting to develop consensus on common weight bias reduction messages that can be tailored and translated in future weight bias interventions. Following this meeting, the group will collaboratively implement strategic research and knowledge translation initiatives building on each others' strengths and leveraging research-knowledge user partnership opportunities"

Our study included 214,298 people who were diagnosed with diabetes between 1998 and 2016 in Scotland, of which 27,697 developed CVD during the study period. We found that risk of CVD increased by 3% each year of living with diabetes. This finding suggests that CVD may become more common as people live longer with diabetes."
A systematic review of compliance with indoor tanning legislation,"['Reimann, Jessica']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,382847,"Youth indoor tanning is a significant public health problem, as there is a substantial increase in risk of lifetime melanoma skin cancer with use of indoor tanning at a young age. Many jurisdictions have enacted indoor tanning legislation in response to the health risks of artificial ultraviolet radiation exposure. Key components of these legislations include banning minor access, requiring parental consent or accompaniment, providing protective eyewear, posting health warning signs, and communicating important health risk information. However, legislation must be complied with to be impactful. Though indoor tanning legislation has been implemented, its effectiveness may not be optimal. This review aims to synthesize existing research around compliance with indoor tanning legislations. Results: There were 15 articles from around the world included in this study. Compliance with most aspects of indoor tanning legislation varied. Compliance with age restrictions ranged from 20% to 89% (mean= 55%; SD= 27), while compliance with posting warning labels in the required locations within a tanning facility ranged from 8% to 72% (mean= 44%; SD= 27). There was good compliance for provision of protective eyewear (84% to 100%; mean= 92%; SD= 8). Variability in compliance with indoor tanning legislation suggests there may be problems with enforcement of the legislations which indicates they are not having their intended protective effects on the public's health. The reasons for such low and varied compliance with certain aspects of legislation, and high compliance with other aspects of legislation, deserve further attention in future research to inform optimal practices around ensuring high and consistent compliance. Greater provisions for enforcement of indoor tanning legislation are needed. Optimal compliance with indoor tanning legislation will likely require increased inspection, mandatory and stricter penalties for infractions, and effective public health messaging."

Among HIV-infected people who use illicit drugs, employment may be a key influence on addiction recovery and other health outcomes. Previous research with HIV-positive and at-risk drug using populations identified a range of individual, contextual and structural barriers to employment over and above drug use, including HIV-infection. It also identified employment attributes that encourage labour market participation. Given the potential health benefits and high barriers to labour market participation for HIV-positive and at-risk people who use illicit drugs, alternative labour market participation models appropriate to individuals who face episodic interruptions in their ability to work are badly needed. Under the supervision of Drs. Thomas Kerr at the University of British Columbia and Tom Patterson at the University of California at San Diego, the proposed post-doctoral project seeks to develop and pilot an adaptive employment intervention for HIV-infected illicit drug users. The proposed intervention design will be based on feasibility assessments and will draw on innovative work models such as Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk, where individuals voluntarily undertake tasks suited to their ability and availability and are paid on a task-by-task basis. Participants will have access to a community generated job bank where they can undertake paid activities compatible with their drug use, health status and health and social services access. Prospective participants will be randomized for participation from an existing CIHR/NIH-funded cohort study of injection drug users (n=750) that collects socio-demographic, behavioural and clinical HIV-related measures. This will facilitate evaluation strategies that match existing longitudinal data with intervention participation outcomes. Evaluation will focus primarily on impact of intervention participation on HIV viral suppression."
Drug-related harm associated with synchronized government income assistance cheque issue: a structural trial of alternative approaches to improve population health outcomes,"['Richardson, Lindsey']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,344786,"In response to the severe and unintended drug-related harms resulting from synchronized income assistance disbursement, we have initiated a randomized controlled trial of a structural intervention that examines whether changing the timing and frequency of disbursement can mitigate these harms. This study adopts a healthy equity theoretical framework that links institutional capacity and design to the production of inequities in health outcomes for disadvantaged populations. It partners with Pigeon Park Savings (PPS), a community branch of VanCity Savings and Credit Union operated by PHS Community Services Society, to deliver an intervention that varies when income assistance funds are released. Two hundred seventy-three volunteer study participants will be randomly allocated for six social assistance cycles to a control or one of two intervention arms. Intervention arm participants will have their income assistance deposited directly into a personalized account at PPS and released: (1) monthly; or (2) semi-monthly, in each case on days that do not fall during the week of cheque issue. Bi-weekly follow up interviews will collect participant information on key outcomes of interest, including drug use, drug related harm (e.g. non-fatal overdose), health and social service utilization, interactions with police, and financial management practices. Self-reported data will be supplemented with participant information from health, financial, police and government databases. Outcomes will be compared between control and intervention arms to identify potential impacts of alternative disbursement schedules on severe and unintended escalations in drug-related harm resulting from synchronized income assistance. The study holds significant potential to provide evidence that leveraging social policy levers can improve population health outcomes and service provision for disadvantaged populations."

There is no known way to prevent prostate cancer. In aggressive prostate cancer, the amount of an enzyme called glycogen synthase kinase-3B (GSK-3B) is higher. Lowering the GSK-3B enzyme level reduces tumour growth and prevents the cancer from spreading (metastasis) in laboratory studies. This level can be lowered by using drugs that are called GSK-3B inhibitors (GSK3Is). Some of these GSK3Is are successful in treating epilepsy and bipolar disorder while others are in experimental stages. We would like to study how successful the real-life use of these drugs is at lowering the risk of prostate cancer and/or dying from the disease by using historical data. First, we will look at whether patients had a higher or lower risk of prostate cancer when using GSK3Is and second, we will look at whether patients had a higher or lower risk of dying from the disease when using GSK3Is. If we find a protective effect from GSK3Is being used in treatment, we can design follow-up studies to determine which drugs work best and how to use them to improve patient care. If we find these drugs worsen prostate cancer, we could recommend the use of other drugs. In the event there is no effect, this would still be reassuring to those who take these drugs on a regular basis."
Exercise Response: Is Irisin a Novel Factor that Explains the Metabolic Adaptation?,"['Rioux, Brittany V']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Exercise', 'Exercise Response', 'Health', 'Hormones', 'Myokines', 'Obesity', 'Physical Activity', 'Type 2 Diabetes']",105000.0,383388,"Over the past few years, the prevalence of obesity and Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has drastically increased, and is expected to continue to rise. This is unfortunate, as it has led to extreme costs to our health care system. Exercise has been recognized as a first line of treatment to prevent and manage these two chronic conditions; but, not everyone benefits from exercise in the same way. For example, some individuals may lose weight from an exercise program, while others who participated in the same program will not see any results. A number of factors may lead to this variation, including a hormone released from your muscles during exercise, called irisin. Irisin is a recently discovered hormone that has the potential to provide a multitude of health benefits for individuals living with obesity and T2D. However, as irisin is novel, it is not clearly understood how different forms of exercise (intensity or duration) impact the typical health outcomes usually observed with exercise.
First, our study will investigate whether irisin is released at a greater extent during high intensity aerobic exercise (e.g.: vigorous bike ride) compared to moderate intensity aerobic exercise (e.g.: jogging) in adults living with obesity. Second, we will study the release of irisin in a group of individuals who did not get any health benefits from a 12-week exercise program. Then, we will see if they get exercise benefits after an additional, more challenging, exercise program that lasts 12 more weeks. This will tell us what form of exercise best stimulates irisin release and whether these changes are related to meaningful clinical outcomes in individuals living with diabetes/pre-diabetes.
Results of this study will be of great importance for health research, as they will provide a better understanding of the link between irisin, exercise, and health outcomes. Furthermore, they will provide us with further insight regarding the right amount of exercise needed to optimize health benefits."
Differential effects of stress on maternal and infant health outcomes.,"['Robinson, Alexandra M']",['N/A'],"['Cardiovascular Disease', 'Gestation', 'Health Outcomes', 'Metabolic Disease', 'Perinatal', 'Prenatal Development', 'Preterm Birth', 'Psychosocial Inventories', 'Random Control Trials', 'Stress']",17500.0,222384,"For centuries, evolutionary biologists have observed that physical and behavioural traits acquired in response to environmental stress are often passed on to subsequent generations. Often, responses that are advantageous in one environment can prove to be problematic in the next. Recent studies that have tracked long-term outcomes of children whose mothers experienced extremely high levels of physical or psychological stress (e.g., famine, civil war, loss of partner) during pregnancy have been positively correlated with poor physical and psychological outcomes. This effect can also be demonstrated in the health outcomes of minority groups that have experienced discrimination or trauma. Until recently however, practitioners have overlooked the effect of maternal stress during gestation as a potential risk factor in the development of adult disease. By identifying health outcomes that are strongly correlated with stress, potential diseases that may be linked to gene/environment disease inheritance can be targeted. 
This study will explore specific types of stress as potential mediators of nine birth outcomes that are predictive of long-term health outcomes: preterm birth; small-for-gestational-age rate; large-for gestational-age rate; fetal mortality rate; severe neonatal morbidity rate; prevalence of congenital anomalies; rate of neonatal hospital readmission; heart rate; and respiratory disease. We will also seek to elucidate if certain types of stressors have differential effects on health outcomes (i.e., is physical stress more harmful than psychological stress, are cardiovascular, respiratory or metabolic systems differentially vulnerable to stress, etc.). The identification of the differential effects of timing and type of stress will enable us to distinguish between innocuous and detrimental stressors."

Established research collaborations and partnerships provide context for the design of our planning grant, which is guided by relationships that are culturally safe, and informed, from its outset by principles of Indigenous and Indigenist research methodologies, integrated Knowledge Translation, and Knowledge to Action Research.

The key question guiding this work is: What are the optimal ways to design health research infrastructure, to overcome inequities and meet the priorities of diverse Indigenous, rural, remote, and northern communities? To address this question, our three interrelated objectives are to synthesise knowledge, learn from practice-based experience and explore emerging scholarly innovations relevant to the design of health research infrastructure for northern, rural, and remote contexts.

Our planning grant team reflects core commitments to Indigenous engagement, to gender equity, to involvement of a range of equity-seeking groups and will address our question and objectives through two concurrent, and interrelated knowledge synthesis pathways: scoping review of the published literature, and scoping conversations to learn from and with knowledge-holders.

Such concerns are not to be ignored in our youth; suicide is the second leading cause of death for those ages 16-24 years (Manion & Short, 2011). Despite this great need, only a small percentage actually access services. A review of the literature indicates many benefits associated with implementing accessible mental health facilities within schools. This can allow for a ""systems of care"" approach where services are ""wrapped around"" the individual and families in need, involving significant caregivers (parents, educators) as well as a multidisciplinary health team within an environment that is safe, familiar, and accessible. Moving mental health services from a traditional clinical approach to a centre embedded within community culture is a first and important step to moving towards a more client-centred, holistic model of health, instead of a one-fits-all approach (Tolan & Dodge, 2005). Taking this community approach to child and youth mental health has been found to have important implications for academic improvement, increased family health, social skills, as well as significant systemic and personal financial savings (Tolan & Dodge, 2005). We propose to begin the planning phase of building a system of care. Our goal is to explore areas of mental health need in local schools and develop a community- informed needs assessment from the perspective of experts, stakeholders, and community partners. Funding is firstly needed to host local consultations with these essential groups in creating a communications strategy. This strategy will focus on engaging children, families, and community members in the planning phase of the needs assessment so that eventual implementation of the assessment will include all voices in building accessible and effective mental health services for Canada's school-age children."

While generating economic growth for local communities, this has also led to concerns among health practitioners and community members about the potential health risks associated with declining air quality due to increased industrial emissions. In the BC Northwest, in particular, projections indicate that sulphur dioxide emissions will likely increase in the Kitimat airshed due to multiple new industrial projects and expansion of existing projects.Timely information about air quality and associated health risks is important for developing public health policies, to prevent potential negative health impacts, and for planning at both local and regional levels. The objectives of this project are to 1) conduct a health impact assessment of impacts of SO2 emissions on human health in the Kitimat region; 2) make recommendations for development of effective surveillance tools to assess air quality health impacts in the region; and 3) review how local and regional policy makers use environmental health impact information for decision-making.This project will directly support Northern Health's organizational impact goal of healthy people in healthy communities, through promoting and protecting healthy environments, and through helping to build regional capacity for conducting health impact assessments and surveillance."

There are no analytic tools that have been specifically designed for planning health interventions in cities. We propose to leverage newly linked data held at Statistics Canada Research Data Centres to go from simply describing what is happening across Canadian cities to what will and can happen under different intervention approaches. We have assembled a team of experts in developing population-based tools in addition to experts in urban health and knowledge translation to support policies and programs designed to support healthy cities.  

We focus on two meaningful outputs for health systems, individuals and population health: premature mortality and avoidable hospitalizations. Premature mortality captures deaths that occur before the expected age in a given population. These deaths are largely considered to be avoidable including through targeted policy and programmatic interventions within cities. Avoidable hospitalizations refer conditions that can be effectively prevented, treated, or managed in outpatient care, and thus should not require hospitalization. These outcomes represent valid, reliable, and robust and meaningful to health system planners. Importantly, they are sensitive to changes in preventive programs and policies, including those with an equity focus, and represent related outcomes along the health continuum.    

The goal of this grant is to use the national survey data linked with mortality and hospitalization databases to develop and validate prediction models that can be used to inform health planning in Canadian cities. We will also demonstrate the application of these tools by testing various interventions. The ability to create these innovative data products using existing data yield a new way to inform and evaluate interventions that will have greatest population benefits."

"Neighbourhood Active Living Environments, Physical Activity and Long-term Risk for Chronic Disease and Premature Mortality","['Ross, Nancy', 'Dasgupta, Kaberi']","['Crouse, Dan L']","['Environment And Health', 'Linked Data', 'Type 2 Diabetes']",98994.0,399942,"Active living environments (ALEs) identify the extent to which our neighbourhoods enable or encourage physical activity during activities of daily life (a concept that is also referred to in the literature as walkability). These places tend to have highly connected streets, are more densely populated, and have a variety of destinations within close walking distance. The potential for these neighbourhoods to affect long-term health care burden and chronic disease mortality remains unknown, but can be answered in part with the recent introduction of the Canadian Active Living Environments database (Can-ALE) to the CANUE repository. Can-ALE is a geography-based measure built to represent the active living friendliness of Canadian communities. We will add Can-ALE to a recent records linkage that includes residential information for respondents of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), for which we also have hospitalization information through the Discharge Abstract Database (DAD), death through the Canadian Mortality Database (CMD), as well as changes in residence through the Historical Tax Summary File (HTSF). This multi-province sample of over 600,000 Canadians will enable comprehensive population-wide analysis that is both efficient in its use of secondary data sources, robust in sample size and data quality, and novel in measuring exposure to urban form. We plan to assess whether living in favourable ALEs is associated with better outcomes for the general population and for those with type 2 diabetes and those identified to be at high risk for the development of diabetes.  Canadian linked survey, health and environmental data is world-class in quality and provides an outstanding opportunity to disentangle how neighbourhood active living environments, individual risk factors and behaviours cumulatively contribute to long term health outcomes of Canadians."
"Developing a community-academic research network based in Maskwacis, Alberta to improve Indigenous gender-related health and wellness","['Ross, Susan J']","['Graham, Bonny', 'Baydala, Lola T', 'Heckman, Seth', 'Louis, Claudine', 'Oster, Richard T', 'Tremblay, Melissa']","['Gender And Health', 'Health And Wellness', ""Indigenous People'S Health""]",58104.0,412806,"This research, based in Maskwacis, Alberta, is a collaboration between the community and researchers to plan research that addresses the topic of GENDER, WELLNESS AND IMPACTS ON HEALTH. The research will address community needs, be feasible, and produce outcomes that are valuable to the community.
RESEARCH STEPS
1.   Identify community priorities for gender, wellness and health research - by engaging community members in public events:
     A ONE-DAY COMMUNITY WORKSHOP will be held where Elders, community members and researchers share their knowledge about the community's priorities.
     The workshop will be followed by a COMMUNITY FEAST to ask for blessings for the new work and give thanks for the community's support.
     A YOUTH FORUM will be held so that youth (often seen as passive research subjects) can become active partners in the research.
2.   Interviews and group discussions with community members, leaders and Elders - will provide further depth regarding the priority research ideas. This process will ensure that one research idea, based on Indigenous values and beliefs goes forward for development.
3.   After identifying one community priority for gender and health research - the idea that community members believe has the highest potential for impact on gender and wellness, will use the final six months of the project to design and plan research addressing that research question.
4.   Assess research capacity and research facilities - during the work, we shall identify the range and number of researchers based in Maskwacis and physical resources available to them, and describe steps to address any deficits, eg initiating plans for research training.
The VALUE OF THE RESEARCH lies in the combination of community members working with researchers to plan a Maskwacis research agenda related to gender, health and wellness, and DEVELOPING A RESEARCH PROJECT THAT ADDRESSES COMMUNITY PRIORITIES, THAT IS READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION AND OWNED BY THE COMMUNITY."
Biostatistical Methods for Disease Cluster Detection and Spatial Modeling,"['Rosychuk, Rhonda J']","['Rowe, Brian H', 'Torabi, Mahmoud']","['Administrative Databases', 'Geographic Variation', 'Pediatric Cancer', 'Respiratory Diseases', 'Spatial Modeling', 'Statistical Cluster Detection']",197085.0,180082,"Finding patterns of disease is an important goal in population and public health. These patterns help the understanding of disease and this can lead to the development of new scientific hypotheses. For example, we may be able to further explore the causes of different diseases and improve disease control by identifying the characteristics that increase disease risk (e.g., pollution). The different patterns of disease may be because of distributions in geographical areas, workplaces, families, and other groupings. For years, researchers have shown how where a disease occurred could be linked to why the disease occurred. For example, in 1854 Dr. Snow examined the geographic pattern of epidemic cholera cases in London, England, and identified a contaminated public water pump as the source of the epidemic. Today, the use of statistical techniques to assess the impact of geography on disease is broadly defined as spatial statistics.

Our proposal features the development of new statistical methods that will be used to monitor disease to find regions with high disease rates. The numbers need to be transformed into useful information (for example, summary conclusions) that can be used by policy makers, and valid statistical tools are essential. We will apply our methods to two sources of Alberta data: Emergency Department visits and childhood cancer cases. We believe that our new methods will be better than existing methods and that we will make new health discoveries. Our analyses will describe and identify trends over place and years of study. Like Dr. Snow, we believe our improved understanding of disease patterns will help us suggest potential causes for differences among different places. These possible causes can be explored to establish their importance. Such work benefits all individuals here and elsewhere, as new insights will be gained on the potential causes of disease, risks of disease can be reduced, and interventions can be targeted."
Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination and multiple sclerosis: a population-based study in Quebec,"['Rousseau, Marie-Claude']","['Arbour, Nathalie', 'Benedetti, Andrea', 'Duquette, Pierre', 'Wolfson, Christina M']","['Bcg Vaccination', 'Birth Cohort', 'Epidemiology', 'Health Administrative Databases', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Population Health']",100000.0,332997,"In multiple sclerosis, the brain and spinal cord are damaged by cells from the immune system. The cause of multiple sclerosis is not known, but some factors are associated with disease risk such as place of birth, sex, smoking, and family history. It is not clear how this process begins, but the immune system plays a role in the development of multiple sclerosis. The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine used in tuberculosis prevention, through its effect on the immune system, might influence the development of multiple sclerosis. In the Province of Quebec, a BCG vaccination campaign took place between 1949 and 1974. The vaccine was offered for free to newborns and schoolchildren. Vaccination information was compiled in a registry, which was recently computerized. The goal of our study is to determine if BCG vaccination is associated with the risk of multiple sclerosis later in life. The effect of BCG vaccination will also be studied separately among persons who were vaccinated at 0-1 year old because exposures in early childhood may influence the immune response. The study population will consist of almost all individuals born in Quebec between 1970 and 1974. Data will be obtained from administrative databases until 2014, including BCG vaccination status, sociodemographic and birth-related factors, information on death if applicable, and use of health services for multiple sclerosis. We will then compare the risk of multiple sclerosis among persons who received the BCG vaccine and those who did not. Given that few preventive and risk factors for multiple sclerosis are known, it is important to explore all avenues. Our study will contribute to the knowledge on the causes of multiple sclerosis, which is necessary to establish preventive strategies."

There are additional high-risk behaviors that may increase the risk of injury, such as drinking alcohol or consuming drugs, not wearing a helmet or other protective equipment, or choosing to ski or snowboard in terrain parks.  Currently, it is unknown what proportion of youth engage in these high-risk behaviors and what influences their decision to do so.
The choice to engage in high-risk behaviors can be influenced by many factors, such as whether youth think they are at increased risk of an injury, if their parents or friends engage in high-risk behavior, or if they think they will get caught.  Girls and boys may make different choices about high-risk behavior and factors that influence their decisions may change as they get older.  This suggests that promotion strategies to encourage safe skiing and snowboarding may need to be different for various groups of people.  
The purpose of this study is to understand high-risk taking attitudes and behaviors among skiing and snowboarding youth.  Skiers and snowboarders will be interviewed at a ski resort and asked if they partake in high-risk behaviors (drinking alcohol, consuming drugs, not wearing protective equipment, and using the terrain park), why they chose to engage in these behaviors, who and what influences their decision.  They will also be asked their age, sex, activity (skiing or snowboarding), experience, previous skiing or snowboarding injury, and other sport participation.  The results will allow for more effective strategies to promote safe skiing and snowboarding that can be targeted towards those skiers and snowboarders who engage in high-risk behaviors.  By understanding youth's attitudes towards these behaviors, policy makers can intervene to reduce unsafe behavior."

Furthermore, these problems tend to co-occur, placing an even greater strain on at-risk individuals. Biological, psychological and social factors have been associated with both mental and physical health problems however these associations are typically examined concurrently.  The Wisconsin Study of Families and Work is a longitudinal study that has followed more than 400 individuals and their families for over 20 years. Extensive data has been collected during 15 waves of data collection from the prenatal period to age 18 years, typically at 1-2 year intervals. Various predictors measured at nearly every wave (e.g. income, parental depression, marital conflict, child temperament, parenting practices, etc.) will be used to simultaneously predict mental and physical health outcomes. Additionally, the role of stress physiology will be thoroughly examined in this model. Cortisol is a main by-product of the stress response and was measured at 4 time points between childhood and adolescence. Both diurnal and reactive measures of cortisol will be included in models to examine how altered stress physiology may act as a risk factor for the development of mental and physical health problems. Furthermore, advanced modeling techniques will be used to examine the co-occurrence of mental and physical health problems over time and to predict the likelihood of future health problems based on current health problems. In order to properly explore the progression of mental and physical health disorders, models that integrate psychological, social, and biological precursors at multiple points in time from infancy to late adolescence are needed in order to provide a comprehensive view of this complex process."

By monitoring SDOH alongside risk factors (i.e. biomedical and clinical contributors of poor health) of disease, we may be better able to predict diseases before they happen. However, it is critical that the data is collected in a timely manner, that represents the diversity in the population of Canada. Artificial intelligence technology, such as portable devices, can collect large amounts of real-time, representative data. Using devices can reduce the labor required for data collection and increase the ability of technology-users to interact with the data. Over the next year, we aim to create a team of national and international experts, and solidify a research project that uses artificial intelligence to collect SDOH and risk factor data to improve surveillance in Canada."

This means there are fewer people to take on the responsibility of elder care and insufficient supports necessary for Metis caregivers themselves to stay healthy. It is important for caregivers to be supported but we do not know of any formal, or informal, supports that exist to help caregivers. This research will be conducted throughout the province of Manitoba, consisting of discussion groups with unpaid Metis caregivers - two in each of the seven MMF Regions - as well as by interviews with program service providers and Metis seniors.

With over 60 million passengers travelling through Canada's three major airports and 200,000 new immigrants each year, the relationship between travel and health is critical for Canada.  Despite the clear value of this information to doctors, decision-makers and Canadian travelers, there are no studies in Canada that estimate the burden of these imported infections. To address this issue, I propose to: (1) count the number of travel-related gastrointestinal and vaccine preventable disease infections and associated health care use in Ontario; (2) measure the riskiest places to travel based on airline travel patterns of Ontario passengers; and (3) create and test an intervention to prevent infection for those travelling to these risky locations. To measure burden (e.g. number of infections and health care use) of travel-related infections, existing health data on infectious disease cases, health care utilization, such as doctor's visits and hospitalizations, and immigration will be linked and analyzed.  A mathematical model will be used to understand which locations are the riskiest, based on the burden of travel-related infections and travel patterns of Ontarians.  Lastly, best practices from the literature, expert opinions from doctors and health promotion theory will be used to create an intervention targeted at Ontario travelers.  Identifying riskiest travel destinations and potentially effective interventions to help travelers protect themselves against infection can be used to reduce the burden of imported infections and outbreaks in Canada."

Research has indicated that parent-child relationships play an essential role in the development of eating disorders. However, the majority of research has focused on both parents as a whole or the maternal figure alone, with limited research on the impact of the paternal figure. Unfortunately, even less research has focused on gender differences within the eating disorder population. 
        The proposed study aims to address shortcomings in the literature by using a correlational design to assess intimate versus distant father-child relationships and their impact on the development of an eating disorder. The study will determine if gender differences exists between the type of father-child relationship and the severity of an eating disorder.
       At present, there is inadequate research funding for eating disorders and there is limited research on the proposed area of study. Therefore, this research will provide additional literature aiding in our understanding of the development of eating disorders and the role gender differences and father-child relationships play in the onset of eating disordered symptoms. The research will improve the health delivery system by providing clinicians with an insight into gender differences within the eating disorder population and into the importance of improving interactions between fathers and children to counteract the development of eating disorders."

However, the extant evidence is concentrated in developed countries and published research on trans men is low and middle-income countries is almost entirely lacking. India has a well-established trans community that has won advances in health and human rights, including a 2014 Supreme Court ruling that established rights to self-identification and to government social and health benefits. Trans men, however, have been largely overlooked in health and social policymaking in India. A lack of empirical data on the health and human rights situation of trans men in India is among the primary obstacles to the development of policies and practices that reflect their needs. To address this gap, we plan to bring together an interdisciplinary Indian-Canadian team to advance health equity for trans men by conducting the first quantitative study of trans men's health in India, using a community-based research approach. We propose planning activities including a scoping review, community consultations, and a planning retreat. The community consultations will engage trans men, community-based organizations, and healthcare providers to identify data needs, inform the study design, and develop partnerships. The retreat will focus on team-building and development of a CIHR Project Grant application, and the majority of attendees will be community members. As one of the first academic-community collaborations focused specifically on trans men's health in a LMIC, this project may serve as a model for future work and will provide much-needed evidence of trans men's health needs in LMIC."

Vaping e-cigarettes: Prospective Outcome Study,"['Schwartz, Robert M', 'Chaiton, Michael O']","['Bondy, Susan J', 'Cohen, Joanna E', 'Kaufman, Pamela E', 'Stanbrook, Matthew B']","['Cohort', 'Dependence', 'E-Cigarettes', 'Prospective', 'Vaping']",382500.0,401703,"Vaping e-cigarettes is considered much less harmful than smoking cigarettes; however, there are indications that it is not benign. Potential health effects found in some studies include cardiovascular, respiratory disease and cancer. There is widespread agreement that switching cigarette smokers to e-cigarette vapers would yield a substantial public health benefit. But, some argue that large numbers of smokers will switch to e-cigarettes, only if they are widely promoted. Public health organizations fear that young people who otherwise would not have smoked cigarettes will become established long-term vapers with associated negative health outcomes.

Ontario data indicate that 11.2% of young adults aged 18 to 24, representing 145,300 people, are past-month vapers. Unknown are the longer-term outcomes of young current past-month non-smoking vapers. Compared with non-vaping young adults: What is their progression to dependence? What are the predictors of continued vaping and progression to dependence? What is the progression of development of respiratory symptoms? 

We will conduct a multi-year prospective study of young adult (16-24 years) vapers and non-vapers. We will recruit a cohort of 2,500 current (past-month) vapers and 2,500 non-current vapers.  Participants will be followed-up annually for 2 years, with brief assessments every 3-months. In-depth interviews with up to 20 vapers and non-vapers will inform reasons for use/non-use and trajectories over time."

The harmful health effects of violence have been well studied in women. Men also experience and commit violence at home, in workplaces, and in public. Rates of public violence such as assault and homicide are greater for men. Yet we know little about the health effects of lifetime violence for men. In Canada, men die earlier than women and are more often disabled from accidents and chronic health problems such as heart disease and depression. These major causes of death in men (e.g. accidents, heart disease, suicide, homicide) can be linked to violence through injury, stress effects, or behaviour such as risky substance use. Beliefs about what it means to be a man also shape men's health. Common thinking is that to measure up to being a man (independent, tough, fearless), men take part in risky actions that lead to disease or harm. But not all men think of being a man in the same way. In this study, we will examine how men see themselves as men, their patterns of lifetime violence and health outcomes. A community sample of 600 English-speaking New Brunswick men ages 19 to 65 will be asked to take part in a survey by internet, phone, or in person. We will ask about their current health, the nature and extent of violence exposure they have had in their lifetimes, and how they see themselves as men. Blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol, weight and height will be measured for some men who take part. Using this information, we will explore the links among lifetime violence, ways of being a man, and health, specifically mental health, chronic pain and risk for heart disease. To better understand these links, we will ask 50 men to talk to us about their health, violence experience, and view of being a man. The findings of this study will be useful for programs and policies promoting and managing men's health."
Lower your risk of getting colorectal cancer,"['Sewitch, Maida J']","['Barkun, Alan N']","['Aboriginal', 'Colorectal Cancer', 'Epidemiology', 'Health Services', 'Screening']",3000.0,288220,"In the past, First Nations have enjoyed lower rates of cancer incidence and mortality compared to non-Aboriginal populations. However, for some cancers including colorectal cancer, incidence is now as high among First Nations men as among non-First Nations men. The cancer picture in First Nations has changed owing to increased life expectancy, a growing population, and multiple modifiable risk behaviors, e.g. poor diet, tobacco smoking, low uptake of cancer screening. Moreover, because First Nations people are diagnosed at a later stage of their disease compared to non-First Nations people, survival tends to be worse. Preliminary work with health care practitioners in Kahnawake (an educational session held in March 2013) revealed a lack of awareness that screening occurs in healthy people. In the proposed Café we will address how routine screening may lower people's risk for developing colorectal cancer, possible ways to improve accessibility to CRC screening, and touch upon the modifiable risk factors that are pertinent to the First Nations community. Findings from our research on a telehealth method of delivering CRC screening will be discussed as will findings from our work on patient indicators of quality in colonoscopy."

Psychosocial work environments and the mental health of Canadian workers: a population-based study,"['Shahidi, Faraz']",['N/A'],"['Cluster Analysis', 'Employment', 'Epidemiology', 'Health Inequalities', 'Mental Health', 'Occupational Health', 'Psychosocial Risk Factors', 'Quantitative', 'Work', 'Working Conditions']",90000.0,396706,"Mental illness accounts for a large and growing share of the total burden of disease in Canada. Widespread concern over the mounting social and economic costs of mental illness has prompted interest in research to better identify and prevent the risk factors that contribute to negative mental health outcomes. Evidence suggests that psychosocial aspects of the work environment (e.g. job control and job security) are major factors contributing to the development of mental health problems among Canadians. Prior studies have examined different dimensions of the psychosocial work environment in isolation. However, these dimensions likely co-occur and act in combination with each other to produce negative mental health outcomes. The objectives of the proposed research are: (i) to measure the prevalence of psychosocial work factors in the Canadian population; (ii) to examine how these psychosocial work factors cluster together across the labour market; (iii) to examine the association between different clusters of psychosocial work factors and mental health outcomes; and (iv) to investigate whether clusters of psychosocial work factors contribute to inequalities in mental health outcomes across age, gender, and occupational groups. To meet these objectives, the proposed research will use data from a 2016 population-based survey administered to a sample of 5,697 Canadian workers. This unique survey provides the most comprehensive portrait of the psychosocial work environment currently available in Canada. The knowledge gained through this research will aid in the development of effective workplace intervention strategies to promote the mental health of the Canadian workforce."
Nutrigenomics and Cardiovascular Disease,"['Shah, Karan R']",['N/A'],"['Cardiovascular Disease (Cvd)', 'Myocardial Infarction  (Mi)', 'Nutrigenomics', 'Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (Snp)']",17500.0,224323,"INTRODUCTION
     Recent studies show that individuals display variable responses to currently recommended diets, suggesting that dietary guidelines need to be adjusted individually. Nutrigenomics is a new field focusing on the interaction between dietary factors and DNA. To date, most studies examining gene-diet interactions in cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been conducted using simplistic scenarios, focusing on only a single genetic variant, dietary component and risk factor at a time.
OBJECTIVES
     To evaluate whether the effects of several selected candidate genes (e.g., APOA1, APOA2, APOA4, APOE, LIPC and CETP) on blood lipid levels, abdominal fatness and heart attack risk are influenced by dietary intake of various fats, carbohydrates, proteins and dietary patterns (e.g., a 'Western Diet'). It is hypothesized that dietary items and patterns influence the effects of gene variants on heart attack risk and its risk factors.
METHODS
     Data from the INTERHEART genetic study, a large study of new heart attack cases and controls from 52 countries, will be used. Demographic, clinical, biochemical, lifestyle and dietary information was collected, and genetic analysis of 9,800 samples for 1536 gene variants (SNPs) in 100 candidate genes was conducted. Karan will work under the supervision of Dr. Mente and will be responsible for the analysis of the large INTERHEART dataset to determine if selected gene-diet interactions with heart attack and its risk factors exist. The proposed timeline for the project is 12 months.  
IMPLICATIONS
     Understanding the biological impact of gene-diet interactions could help predict responses of patients and populations to specific dietary interventions, and provide important insights into the causes of CVD.  The presence of interactions would have important implications for disease treatment and prevention, because it would allow physicians to provide dietary guidance tailored according to the patient's genetic make-up."

The goal of this project is to do research in a better way and improve relationships between health care systems and Indigenous peoples to help improve health and wellness in Indigenous communities. 
Over the last year, our team has worked with Ktunaxa First Nation in the Kootenay region of British Columbia to develop and test a new approach to research that is led by Ktunaxa peoples and reflects Ktunaxa culture. Ktunaxa Elders named this approach xaqana itkini (Many Ways of Working Together). Important features of this approach include: coming together during community gatherings and ceremonies, starting with a shared meal, using traditional approaches for sharing information and solving problems, including everyone's voices, and getting feedback often. 
We tested the xaqana itkini (Many Ways of Working Together) approach in Ktunaxa communities by working together to create a Ktunaxa Model of Wellness. During this process, community members shared their ideas about what a healthy community looks like. Community members liked this approach and said that the process was ""really meaningful, really powerful."" 
Testing the xaqana itkini (Many Ways of Working Together) approach was the first step along the pathway toward a long-term working relationship between Ktunaxa Nation and Interior Health Authority. The goal of the next step is to use the xaqana itkini (Many Ways of Working Together) approach to look at how the health care system can learn from Ktunaxa understandings of wellness to improve health services in Ktunaxa communities."
The social and structural contexts of HIV/STIs among women and youth working in the sex industry in Canada,"['Shannon, Kate']",['N/A'],"['Gender', 'Hiv/Sti Prevention', 'Sex Work', 'Sexual Health', 'Social Epidemiology', 'Violence', 'Women', 'Youth']",300000.0,213410,"This new investigator award application aims to investigate the social (violence, work conditions) and structural (laws, regulations, urban renewal) contexts of HIV/STIs among youth and women working in the sex industry in Vancouver, BC. The persistently high rates of health-related harms, violence and mortality among sex workers both in Canada and globally highlight a desperate need for renewed public health interventions targeting the reduction of harms in the sex industry. Building on international guidelines and the CIHR priorities for sex and gender-based analyses, we will aim to evaluate longitudinally the broader risk environment that shapes gendered negotiation of partner-level risk and HIV/STI acquisition among youth and adult women in sex industry work.  To meet these objectives, the proposed research will be based upon the assembly and follow-up of a real cohort consisting of: 1) 500 existing and new adult women working in both the street and indoor sex industry in the AESHA (An Evaluation of Sex Workers' Health Access) I cohort; and 2) 500 female youth aged 14-20 years who have exchanged sex for money, drugs, gifts, shelter or other commodities in the previous 30days in the AESHA II cohort (youth arm).   The novel integration of individual mapping data and neighborhood environment data from publicly- available data sources (such as, housing, violence) will increase the potential for directly informing interventions to reduce harm. To our knowledge this study is among the first prospective studies of sex work in North America. The team I have assembled brings a wealth of expertise in observational and intervention research, policy and sex work, and as such, is uniquely positioned to conduct this study, which aims to directly improve the health of some of the most marginalized youth and women in Canadian society."

Why do you care? Exploring the experience of health care providers working with persons with dementia in primary care memory clinics,"['Sheiban Taucar, Linda']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,288398,"Objectives: Providing care for persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) is challenging, given the stressors and uncertainties experienced by persons with dementia and their families, the complexities of assessment and management, and the limited efficacy of available treatments.  While some research has looked at the experience of families who care for persons with ADRD, little is known about the experience of primary health care providers. We explored the experiences of health care providers working with persons with dementia. 

Method: Using a phenomenological approach, semi-structured interviews were completed with interprofessional team members in two primary care-based memory clinics in Southern Ontario. Health care providers were asked about their experiences working with persons with dementia in a team context.  Interviews were analyzed using Colaizzi's (1978) method of analysis of phenomenological data. 

Results: Health care providers discussed their motivations for working with persons with dementia, how they came to be part of a memory clinic team, what they valued and found rewarding in their work, and the challenges and frustrations they experienced. Working as part of a team could be challenging but was also a major source of encouragement. 

Conclusions: Although primary care is playing an increasingly important role in dementia care, future research should examine experiences of health care providers in other settings. A deeper understanding of health care providers' experiences working with persons with dementia yields insights into how these workers and teams can be better prepared and supported to provide care to persons with dementia and their families."

Specifically, a meeting of stakeholders will be convened to: 

1. Discuss the current research literature base concerning the effects of alcohol consumption and its interactions with metabolic dysfunction and viral hepatitis on the etiology and disease course of liver disease, by the major disease stages and by socio-economic status.

2. Discuss current alcohol-related liver disease monitoring and prevention strategies as well as current gaps in these strategies, with a focus on the Canadian experience.

3. Construct an inventory of data sources which can be used to characterize the etiology and course of liver disease taking into consideration the interactions between alcohol consumption, metabolic dysfunction, and viral hepatitis.

4. Create a report for dissemination to stakeholders which highlights current gaps in our knowledge concerning the etiology and course of liver disease related to alcohol use.

5. Form an international alcohol and liver disease research network to develop a full-scale grant proposal aimed at addressing current knowledge gaps.

The outcomes of this project are multifold. Firstly, this project will increase awareness of the key risk factors for liver disease through a knowledge exchange between key researchers and policy makers. This knowledge exchange will highlight key interventions which can address the rising burden of liver disease in Canada. Secondly, a full-scale grant application will be developed with the aim of describing the etiology and progression of liver disease."
The Causal Role of Acute Alcohol Consumption in Unprotected Sex among MSM at Risk for Acquiring HIV,"['Shuper, Paul A']","['Loutfy, Mona R', 'Rehm, Jürgen T']","['Aids', 'Alcohol', 'Condoms', 'Hiv', 'Men Who Have Sex With Men (Msm)', 'Risk', 'Sex']",264158.0,215224,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) remains a public health issue in Canada, and particularly affected by the Canadian HIV epidemic are men who have sex with men (MSM), who comprise over half of all HIV diagnoses in Canada to date. Unprotected sexual intercourse is the primary method through which HIV is spread in Canada, and this is especially true for MSM populations. Although it has often been suggested that consuming alcohol causes people to engage in unprotected sex, research has tended to provide mixed support for this link. Our understanding of the alcohol-risky sex link is further limited by the fact that there has been no research to date that has directly examined alcohol's causal role in condom use decisions among populations who are at an elevated risk for acquiring HIV, including MSM. Building on the previous work in this area and addressing these limitations, the present investigation will involve an innovative experimental approach to identify the causal role of alcohol consumption in MSM's intentions to engage in unprotected sex, taking into account risk-relevant personality traits, partner characteristics, and alcohol-related expectancies. In this study, 130 sexually active MSM will be recruited from a clinical care facility to take part in an experimental session in which they will 1) complete measures assessing personality traits and expectancies, 2) undergo an alcohol manipulation, and 3) indicate their intentions to engage in a variety of protected and unprotected sexual acts with a series of hypothetical sexual partners. Results yielded through this comprehensive experimental approach will help identify the extent to which alcohol plays an independent role in condom use decisions, which, in turn, could guide the development of future HIV prevention initiatives that target unprotected sex among at-risk populations. Such initiatives could ultimately impact large-scale public health campaigns aimed at reducing HIV incidence in Canada over time."

In particular, tackling TB in countries like South Africa has been difficult given the high prevalence of co-morbidity between HIV/AIDS and TB.  New technologies have been developed to help practitioners prevent, diagnose, and treat TB across the globe.  However, new antitubercular drugs (i.e., bedaquilin, delamaind) have serious side effects, while new diagnostics (i.e., Xpert MDR/RIF) raise the specter of diagnosing more patients than can be treated in LMICs. Given the current uncertainty surrounding TB, policy makers, healthcare workers, and patients are required to balance the risks and benefits of new research, prevention, and treatment techniques with incomplete or suboptimal information, which requires normative judgments as to what is and is not worth risking, for what, and for how much. To date, a robust ethical analysis of risk and benefit in the context of new TB research, prevention, and treatment is lacking.  There are no studies that link the perspectives of policy makers, bench scientists, and healthcare workers with a philosophical informed analysis of ethical issues related to TB care.  This project proposes to address this knowledge gap and provide policy and practice recommendations.  The concepts of reciprocity and solidarity will be evaluated to see whether they could potentially help guide risk-benefit analysis for TB care by taking into account the perspectives of key stakeholders.  We will conduct a philosophical analysis of the risks and benefits of new technologies for TB, coupled with qualitative interviews of policy makers, bench scientists, and healthcare workers in South Africa, the World Health Organization, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation."

The majority of older adults prefer to stay at home for as long as possible. However, for many, receipt of home care services is the only option that enables them to remain independently and safely in their home.  At present, more than 1.4 million Canadians receive publicly funded home care services annually. As the Canadian population ages and with earlier discharges from hospital, the need for home care and associated costs continue to escalate.  To 'age in place' older people also require community and built environments that facilitate their health and mobility. As health and function decline with aging, older adults' ability to engage with challenging physical environments (e.g. poor street lighting or long distances to amenities) diminishes. Advancing knowledge in this emerging field is key to planning and developing effective strategies that allow older adults to grow old at home.

Research Goals and Objectives: The overarching goal of my program of research is ""adding life to later years"" so that older adults can live independently in their homes for as long as possible.  Thus, my research focuses on enhancing the health and mobility of older adults across two settings: 1. delivery and receipt of home care services and, 2. the neighbourhood built environment. My specific five-year research objectives are to: A. examine the experiences of older adults and home support workers in the delivery of home care services with specific attention to issues of worker and older adult safety; B. evaluate features of the built environment that facilitate or impede older adults' mobility, social and physical health.  Ultimately, I seek to improve the quality and utility of evidence for policy and practice change that will enable older adults to age in place."

The remaning 30% will be spent at MCHP, under the supervision of Dr. Alan Katz, Director. MCHP is a research institution that houses the world renown MCHP Data Repository. The fellow will design and lead a project that prepares data from seven programs implemented by HCMO designed to prevent Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder and support families affected by FASD for research purposes and linkage with the MCHP Data Repository. This project will consist of working across the 6 departments of HCMO as well as with MCHP to analyze data sources, understand the programs the data comes from, and to define, scope out and cost research uses for the data; including refining the message, and identifying value to program planners and policy makers. Preparing these data for research is vital to ensuring that program implementation is based upon quality evidence based informed policy, and will ultimately enhance program delivery for people with FASD in Manitoba. The output from this project directly address HCMO impact goals by preparing data that ensures services and programs in Manitoba are based on strong research and evaluation, and enhances the power of the MCHP data Repository by adding another novel, dataset that facilitates research into social determinants."
Addressing Stigma Across the Life Course: A Critical Exploration of Interventions and Programs for Queer Peoples in Canada,"['Sinno, Jad']",['N/A'],"['2slgbtq+ Individuals', 'Critical Pedagogy', 'Focus Groups', 'Health Interventions', 'Intersectionality', 'Literature Review', 'Queer Health', 'Queer Theories', 'Social Justice', 'Stigma Reduction']",135000.0,492486,"The alarming health disparities faced by queer peoples in Canada are a significant human rights and public health issue. Queer people experience higher rates of mental health issues, substance abuse, and physical and sexual abuse compared to cisgender and heterosexual individuals. These disparities are largely due to the social stigma associated with queer identities. This study will use an interdisciplinary and critical social science approach to explore current interventions and public health initiatives aimed at reducing queer stigma in Canada. The research will involve three phases: 1) mapping the existing literature on stigma interventions, 2) understanding stakeholder perspectives on these interventions, and 3) developing an educational module for future queer health practitioners and scholars related to queer stigma. By exploring the successes and gaps of stigma interventions, this research will provide valuable insights to improve healthcare services for queer communities and promote social justice. The findings will be integrated into training programs to better equip future practitioners to address queer stigma effectively. Ultimately, this research is a necessary step for promoting the health and wellbeing of queer individuals in Canada."
"HIV prevention altruism among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men. Associations with attitudes and behaviour related to sexual risk-taking.","['Skakoon-Sparling, Shayna P']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2308.0,411844,"A growing body of evidence suggests that concern for others (i.e., altruism) influences decision making to reduce HIV transmission and avoid sexual risk.  Thus, HIV prevention altruism ranges from preventing passing HIV to one's partners, to concern regarding the impact of HIV on one's community. Given that HIV prevention altruism might affect the behaviour of gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (GBM), we investigated how this factor could be predicted by community involvement, attitudes, and sexual behaviours among HIV-positive and HIV-negative GBM. We recruited 2440 sexually active GBM living in Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver to take part on a multi-city cross-sectional study (the Engage Study). Participants completed a computer-assisted survey that included a measure of HIV prevention altruism (the Sexual Communal Altruism Scale). We found that higher scores on our measure of HIV prevention altruism were associated with lower sexual compulsivity, fewer male sexual partners (in the past six months), a lower likelihood of engaging in condomless sex (in the past six months), and fewer perceived barriers to condom use. However, HIV prevention altruism scores had no association with involvement in the LGBTQ community.  These findings offer some insight into how HIV prevention altruism impacts HIV risk behaviours among GBM."
Northern and Rural Food Systems in Indigenous Communities in Canada,"['Skinner, Kelly']",['N/A'],"['Food Environments', 'Food Security', 'Food Sovereignty', 'Indigenous Health', 'Northern Canada']",2050.0,344075,"Remote and northern Indigenous communities in Canada face enormous challenges accessing healthy and nutritious foods. While access to wild foods has declined, the cost of market based foods have become very high. This paper looks at the unique and complex food systems that developed in northern and rural Indigenous communities and uses a recent online survey to outline how these changes have affected Indigenous people's food choices in the North. The online survey was developed in consultation with community partners and assesses the food buying experiences of people living in northern communities across Canada. Findings highlight the powerful role and oligopoly/monopoly of retailers and corporations that control the food environment of residents in northern Canada."
Assessing the Efficacy of an Active Aging with Resilience Program for Enhancing Older Adults' Psychosocial Wellbeing and Functional Independence,"['Skrotzki, Cassandra C']",['N/A'],"['Active Aging', 'Cognitive Impairment', 'Optimal Aging', 'Psychosocial Wellbeing', 'Resilience Training']",2000.0,493339,"Active aging aims to promote optimal aging through psychological wellbeing, functional independence, and social connection. Modifiable behaviors that support elders' cognition, physical capacity, and/or social participation delivered either alone or in combination, can effectively enhance elders' psychological wellbeing and functional independence (i.e., cognitive and/or physical capacity). However, the established literature has failed to adequately account for the impact of older adults' agentic resiliency in optimal aging trajectories.

This project aimed to examine the immediate psychosocial benefits of an intensive 4-week multi-domain active aging (AA) program with and without a resilience training module (AA or AA+R), relative to an active control (AC) condition. We hypothesized that 1) older adults in the AA or AA+R groups would display greater post-program improvements in psychological wellness and functional independence relative to the AC group, and 2) the AA+R condition would display further gains relative to AA group alone. The AA and AA+R groups completed 4 weeks of online active aging training, including three 15-min training modules for aerobic exercise, cognitive training, and social engagement twice per week followed by 2 practice sessions. The AA+R group further received a 15-min resilience training session, while the AA group watched a filler video. Composite scores indexing psychosocial wellbeing and functional independence (i.e., physical and cognitive capacity) were assessed at baseline and post-intervention. Each psychosocial and functional independence outcome was assessed independently, employing mixed model ANOVAs.

Results from this study address an important gap in the literature by elucidating whether additional resilience training further enhances psychosocial wellbeing and functional independence over-and-above an active aging program. This project also includes a follow-up assessment which is often overlooked in the literature."
Is sleep duration related to obesity in Canadian children and adolescents? An analysis of results from the Canadian Health Measures Survey.,"['Sluggett, Larine']",['N/A'],"['Adolescents', 'Blood Pressure', 'Canadian Health Measures Survey', 'Children', 'Circadian Rhythms', 'Epidemiology', 'Insulin Resistance', 'Metabolic Syndrome', 'Obesity', 'Sleep']",17500.0,224356,"Obesity is associated with elevated risks for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Rates of overweight and obesity in children and adolescents in Canada are increasing rapidly; research examining potentially modifiable risk factors is critical. Experimental research on adults suggests that sleep deprivation influences appetite and weight related hormones in a way that favours the development of obesity.  If short sleep duration contributes to obesity in Canadian children and youth, this represents an area for obesity prevention because sleep length can potentially be modified. Using data from the national Canadian Health Measures Survey conducted in 2007-2009, this project will examine the relationship between sleep duration and obesity/overweight in children and adolescents across Canada. A second important area of inquiry is to identify risk and protective factors associated with sleep length in Canadian children and youth. This information is crucial for the development of public health interventions targeted to populations most at risk.  Factors potentially associated with short sleep duration examined in this study include age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, physical activity, and time spent watching television or on the computer.  Overweight and obese children tend to become overweight adults; addressing weight problems earlier in life is advantageous.  The findings from this research will determine the degree and scope of the influence of sleep duration on obesity in Canadian youth, ascertain populations most at risk, and identify risk and protective factors associated with short and long sleep duration.  Outcomes from this research include evidence to support the development of public health campaigns and policy changes promoting healthy sleep habits in children, adolescents, and their families, thereby attenuating the rise of obesity and other cardiovascular disease risk factors at a national level."
"Estimating the impact of alcohol deregulation in Ontario on future burden of alcohol consumption and harms for the overall population and across vulnerable sub-populations: Evidence to inform the complex relationships between alcohol policy, consumption, and harms.","['Smith, Brendan', 'Hobin, Erin P']","['Li, Ye', 'Manuel, Douglas G', 'Mckenzie, Kwame J', 'Myran, Daniel', 'Rehm, Jürgen T', 'Sherk, Adam N', 'Stockwell, Timothy R', 'Wolfson, Michael C']","['Alcohol Attributable Fraction', 'Alcohol Consumption', 'Alcohol Harm Paradox', 'Alcohol Harms (Hospitalization And Mortality)', 'Alcohol Policies (Availability, Price)', 'Health Equity', 'Healthcare Costs Of Alcohol Use', 'Population Health Intervention Research', 'Public Health Policy Evaluation', 'Simulation Modelling']",618288.0,418840,"Alcohol is a leading risk factor for death and disease in Canada. The top alcohol-related conditions include liver diseases, cardiovascular diseases, injuries, alcohol dependence, and cancers. Studies show that despite consuming lower levels of alcohol, lower socioeconomic groups are more likely to experience alcohol-related harms than higher socioeconomic groups. Therefore, alcohol policies aiming to reduce population-level alcohol use and harms have potential to reduce health inequalities. In Canada, policies have been implemented in provinces and territories to moderate alcohol use and minimize its negative consequences. However, over the past two decades, Alberta, British Columbia, and most recently Ontario have deregulated alcohol sales and increased privatization of alcohol retail markets. Few studies have examined the impact of deregulation on alcohol use and health harms in the population, and particularly on ""social inequities in health"" (i.e., health differences between social groups that are avoidable and unfair). The proposed changes to alcohol policies in Ontario offer a real-world opportunity to examine the relationships between how alcohol is sold across the province and the current and projected burden of alcohol-related harms and costs in the population, and within social groups (i.e., age, sex, and socioeconomic status). The purpose of the proposed research is to use an innovative modelling methodology that combines population surveys linked to health administrative datasets to better understand the extent to which changes to alcohol policy impact alcohol consumption, alcohol-related health harms and healthcare costs in the population overall and among key subpopulations, including youth and young adults, females, and lower socioeconomic populations. Results of the proposed research can be used to directly inform alcohol policies and health equity strategies in Ontario and across Canada."

As such, it follows that the concept of 'health inequity' involves both a descriptive and a normative, philosophical component: the descriptive component tells us what differences in health count as health inequities (e.g., 'differences in rates of breast cancer between Canadians of South Asian descent and the general population'), and the normative, philosophical component tells us why those differences in health should be viewed as ethically wrong or bad, i.e., 'unjust', such that they should count as 'inequities'. Two groups of scholars have worked in parallel on health equity-one on the descriptive component (those in public health sciences, e.g., epidemiologists) and one on the normative component (those in the humanities and social sciences, e.g., philosophers and ethicists)-yet a significant gulf exists between their respective research. This is problematic, because by failing to explicitly ground public health interventions in specific philosophical criteria of health equity, such interventions may fail to target the most appropriate populations or the most ethically important differences in health, thereby failing to achieve the most 'equitable' health outcomes. Conversely, without empirically testing different ethical criteria of health equity, philosophers may end up producing guidance for public health interventions that ultimately have undesirable outcomes in practice. Thus, we plan to host a full-day meeting which will bring together scholars from the humanities and social sciences (i.e., philosophy and ethics) with scholars and knowledge users from public health sciences to discuss the establishment of a program of research that would seek to better integrate the fields of philosophy and epidemiology via a project that aims to empirically model public health interventions, and, namely, their capacity to reduce 'health inequities', according to key philosophical criteria of health equity."

Mainstream services and mental health promotion messaging around suicide, self-harm and self-injury do not reflect the experiences, knowledge or needs of Indigenous youth and their rights to self-determination over their own bodies. The goal of this youth-directed research is to identify best practices around suicide, self-harm and self-injury prevention and mental health promotion for Two Spirit, gender non-conforming and LGBTTQQIA (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, transsexual queer, questioning, intersex and asexual )youth. We will accomplish this work through a research partnership between the Native Youth Sexual Health Network (NYSHN) and the Well Living House (WLH), based at the Centre for Research on Inner City Health, St. Michael's Hospital. Our objectives are to build on and strengthen existing relationships and governance structures between Indigenous youth communities, NYSHN and the WLH, engage with Indigenous youth around the re-framing of language in current suicide, self-harm and self-injury prevention messaging and services, to conduct a systematic review of literature on existing services in this area and to conduct an environmental scan identify promising practices including models of healing such as Rites of Passage and Arts-based methodologies Rites of passage and coming of age ceremonies incorporate many of the key elements of the overall research framework that we will use in this project, including youth-led initiatives and the involvement of the larger community."

With international assets valued at $170 billion, Canadian mining operations contributed $97 billion to Canada's GDP in 2017. While the economic benefits accrue to corporate and state interests, mining often occurs in remote and rural areas inhabited by Indigenous and other minoritized and/or marginalized communities, and has been linked to worsening health, social, and environmental conditions. Too few evidence-based practices have been identified that monitor and report on health and social outcomes, and limited legal mechanisms exist to launch formal investigations. At present, no Canadian laws can compel Canadian companies working abroad to ensure they follow sustainable and ethical mining standards.

Our international interdisciplinary team composed of public, population, and environmental health researchers with backgrounds in anthropology, environmental science, global governance, geography, and medicine, and expertise in participatory, qualitative, and quantitative mixed methods are well-positioned to conduct comparative case studies of select communities in Brazil, the Kyrgyz Republic, and the Philippines where a Canadian mine predominates. Using a community-engaged approach and intersectional lens, we will explore the impact of the mine on the physical, social, and environmental health and well-being of communities and the role that local, national, transnational policies, politics, and trade agreements play in these issue"
Drug overdose after departure from hospital against medical advice,"['Staples, John A']","['Brubacher, Jeffrey R', 'Crabtree, Alexis E', 'Daly-Grafstein, Daniel', 'Khan, Mayesha', 'Moe, Jessica', 'Nasmith, Trudy', 'Slaunwhite, Amanda K']","['Clinical Epidemiology', 'Discharge Against Medical Advice', 'Drug Overdose', 'Hospital Care', 'Linked Administrative Healthcare Data', 'Substance Use Disorder (Including Opioid Use Disorder)']",336600.0,461249,"People who use illicit drugs are more likely to discharge themselves from hospital even when their doctor tells them they require ongoing hospital care. This is called 'discharge against medical advice'. The risk of drug overdose might be higher in the days following discharge against medical advice because these individuals are often still very sick and might have lower tolerance for drugs than they did prior to their hospitalization. Overdose risks in the days after discharge against medical advice aren't well understood because they haven't been studied before.

British Columbia (BC) has been one of the hardest-hit provinces in the overdose crisis. Most drug overdoses in BC involve opioids. Our study will use hospitalization data from BC to examine whether people are more likely to overdose after discharge against medical advice. We will also examine risk factors for overdose after discharge against medical advice, including whether medications prescribed to treat opioid use disorder (such as methadone and Suboxone) reduce the risk of overdose. Finally, we will examine whether discharge against medical advice increases the risk of emergency department use, hospital readmission, overdose death, or death from any cause. 

To complete our study, we will analyze the real-world health data of about 200,000 British Columbians hospitalized between 2015 and 2019. The data has had names and other identifying features removed to protect the identity of individuals. This data has previously been used by public health researchers to inform BC's response to the opioid overdose crisis.

Our results will help doctors and public health officials design programs to prevent overdose and potentially save lives."
Men and Workplace Health: Establishing a Research Agenda to Advance Workplace Health and Safety,"['Stergiou-Kita, Melpomeni M', 'Mansfield, Elizabeth A']","['Colantonio, Angela', 'Lafrance, Marc E', 'Mantis, Steve', 'Oliffe, John L', 'Power, Nicole G', 'Theberge, Nancy']","['Health Promotion', 'Injury Prevention', 'Masculinity', ""Men'S Health"", 'Return To Work', 'Sex And Gender Analysis', 'Work', 'Workplace Culture', 'Workplace Health And Safety']",24780.0,283977,"We can gain a better understanding of differences between men and women's health by examining how the concepts of ""sex"" and ""gender"" interact with and influence various aspects of health, such as health promotion, risk taking behaviour, chronic disease and occupational injuries. For example, men are more likely to die from cardiovascular disease, diabetes and occupational injuries. In fact the majority of workplace fatalities in Canada occur among men. 

The World Health Organization indicates that there is a limited understanding of how socially proscribed male ideals and values such as competitiveness, strength, control and independence may influence men's behaviour, expectations, and daily practices. The workplace is a key setting where gender-typical behaviour can influence health and safety and it is often within worker roles that men are exposed to the greatest dangers, health risks and potential for death. The enactment of dominant masculine behaviours, particularly in high-risk occupations, presents significant challenges related to health and safety practices in the workplace.  

To increase our understanding of men's physical and mental health in relation to workplace safety practices we will bring together researchers from varied disciplines (e.g. occupational science, sociology, men's health, occupational health and safety) and workplace stakeholders (e.g. occupational health and safety personnel, workers, employers) for a two-day workshop in Toronto. The goals of this workshop are to: 1) identify research gaps in the areas of men's health, work, and workplace safety; 2) develop a research strategy; 3) develop research projects to enhance men's safety at work."

It is known that these groups have different needs and strengths in how they deal with their frequent experiences of traumatic stress such as violence, crime and disasters. However, most research has focused on the mental health difficulties or what is called post-traumatic stress injuries (PTSI) developed by a number of PSP and less on their coping strategies even though a large number of personnel do not develop PTSI. Another aspect that needs attention is to know how PSP prefer to access mental health information and services. This study will investigate these two unexplored areas, how PSP develop resilience, and how they prefer to use and access mental health resources. The study will focus on the police forces in Ontario due to recent reports of increased distress among these forces, which need urgent attention. To collect information, it will use an online survey, interviews, community forums and photo exhibits. Following a participatory approach the study will be led by an advisory committee of members of the police forces recruited among police branches in diverse cities in Ontario, such as Waterloo, Ottawa, Sudbury and Brantford. The aim of the research is to put the insights of members of police forces up front, serving not only as users of the knowledge resulting from the research, but also as producers of such knowledge. The resulting findings on how resilience building strategies and the effective and timely use of mental health services and information can prevent mental distress among police forces will be circulated among police branches in Canada, other PSP groups, mental health service providers, municipal, provincial and federal policy makers and the community at large."

Macronutrient Distribution as a Determinant of Body Mass Index among Canadian Children,"['Sumanac, Dunja']",['N/A'],"['Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges', 'Body Mass Index', 'Childhood', 'Nutrition', 'Obesity']",17500.0,199657,"The prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity status in Canada has significantly risen over the past few decades. According to current statistics, approximately one-quarter of Canadian children between the ages of 2 and 17 can be classified into the body mass index (BMI) categories of overweight or obese. Furthermore, childhood obesity has a significant impact on health into adulthood and has been associated with increased risk for Type 2 diabetes, early onset joint problems, heart attack and stroke and mental health issues. The significant health problems, as well as potential economic consequences, necessitate further research in the field of childhood obesity.

The study of obesity determinants is an area of research that is becoming increasingly important, especially with respect to childhood obesity. Few investigations have considered the impact of diet balance on BMI in terms of adherence to known recommendations, such as Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDRs), in a sample of Canadian children. Dietary intake within the AMDR has been shown to reduce the risk for chronic diseases. This project would focus on assessing whether a relationship exists between the macronutrient distribution of food intake and BMI among children aged 6 to 13 in the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board (HWDSB). Furthermore, differences in macronutrient distribution would be assessed between groups of children falling into healthy, overweight and obese BMI categories.

The results of this study would contribute to the overall knowledge regarding childhood nutrition and the trend towards obesity. Ideally, the data would allow for the assessment of the current recommendations for AMDRs for children between the ages of 6 and 13, so that revisions may be proposed if necessary.  In addition, the information collected could also be applied towards the development of a healthy lunch program in selected schools within the HWDSB."

One hypothesis explaining the link between grip strength and cardiovascular disease is that grip strength is a measure of how well one's body is functioning, also known as frailty. However, our understanding of the mechanisms explaining why grip strength may predict the occurrence of cardiovascular disease is currently limited. We will use data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, which collected data on more than 50 thousand Canadian aged 45 years and higher, to better understand the associations between grip strength and the risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease. We will also assess whether alternative measures of frailty are more associated with cardiovascular risk than grip strength."

Chapters will address cannabis use and motivation, mental health, addiction and effective approaches for the prevention and treatment of cannabis use and cannabis use disorder. To disseminate the findings, we propose to work with outstanding Canadian researchers to hold community events in five locations across Canada from September to December, 2015. These events will share what we know, what we do not know, and what evidence is emerging with local representatives from a variety of sectors including education, primary and specialized health care, youths, parent support networks, mental health professionals, public health, research, government, treatment providers, the drug prevention workforce, and public health. A significant portion of each event will focus on addressing common questions related to cannabis and engaging attendees in a meaning dialogue that speaks directly to the relevance of our report findings to their daily work. In terms of expected outcomes, these sessions will help to improve the capacity of stakeholders to engage in evidence-informed conversations with youth and their families about the effects of cannabis use, which may ultimately help to reduce the harms associated with this drug."

As females age, they experience normal changes that can also be signs of cancer. Abnormal bleeding is often the first symptom of EC, but is quite common in females approaching menopause (1 in 3). An EC diagnosis must be confirmed by a painful and invasive endometrial biopsy. Given that less than 10% of those with abnormal bleeding have cancer, we need novel, less-invasive tools to distinguish symptoms of cancer from normal aging. Our research project considers patterns in risk factors, biological, and digital app-collected data (menstrual, sleep, activity, hormone imbalance symptoms) to predict which females are at higher risk of EC. We want to understand whether digital tools, used in combination with biological information from at-home tests (tampon, vaginal swabs, or saliva), are acceptable to those with elevated risk of cancer as a way to self-monitor. In our study, we will collect data from females 40 years and older in the general population, as well as those referred to a gynecologist to undergo a biopsy for abnormal bleeding.

Individuals with a uterus experience changes in bleeding as they age, that can be the first sign of endometrial cancer. Abnormal bleeding is common in those approaching menopause (1 in 3). To rule out cancer, a painful and invasive endometrial biopsy is needed. Given that less than 10% of women with abnormal bleeding have cancer, we need novel, less-invasive tools to distinguish symptoms of cancer from normal aging.

In this project, we consider patterns in risk factors, biological, and digital app-collected data (menstrual, sleep, activity) to predict who is at higher risk of endometrial cancer. We want to understand whether digital tools, used in combination with biological information from at-home tests (DNA from tampons, microbial community from vaginal swabs, or hormones from saliva), can be used by individuals with elevated risk of cancer as a way to self-monitor.

We will collect data from individuals referred to a gynecologist to undergo a biopsy for abnormal bleeding. Participants will complete a questionnaire on risk factors and complete an at-home sample collection. We will use this information to discern who is most likely to have cancer. A subset of participants who have DNA mutations associated with endometrial cancer will be selected to continue self-tracking for 6 months, providing weekly app-collected data, as well as self-testing via tampon, saliva, and vaginal swabs at a second time-point for comparison.

With universal access to antiretroviral treatment since 2004 in Zambia, female adolescents are now living well into adulthood. Undergoing the transformation into womanhood with HIV is a new phenomenon that is not well understood in Zambia. Decreased mortality from AIDS has created new challenges for health and social services including chronic physical and social factors that impede daily activities and exacerbate social exclusion. There is a growing body of work exploring the needs of adults living with HIV, but no one has adopted this approach with female adolescents, despite their elevated HIV rates. This study will employ innovative photography and discourse techniques to describe the lived experiences, understandings, well-being and future outlook of female adolescents living with HIV. The study findings will contribute to the current body of knowledge across three tiers. First, it will provide valuable information on the impact of HIV on the lives of female adolescents. Second, it will inform global HIV researchers on targeted ways to improve this population's health, community engagement and future outlook through health and social services. Third, it will contribute to the noteworthy achievements Canada, as a global leader, has made in its initiatives to reduce the impact of HIV in the developing world."

Gerontologists continue to attempt to understand the natural aging process by considering factors leading to ""healthy"" and ""successful aging"". To uncover not just if, but how and why, an individual might age successfully despite illness and adversity, requires a more encompassing model.

One existing method of altering these trajectories has been to monitor and identify gaps in children's readiness for school. Often measured as children's language/cognitive, physical, and social emotional preparedness at school entry, school readiness has been shown to predict academic achievement which subsequently affects children's opportunities for adult employment, income, living conditions, and gender equity. To date much of the investigation into school readiness has focused on skills such as reading and writing ability, yet there is a burgeoning area of research that suggests social-emotional health may be a better predictor of future academic success than even previous academic achievement.

Identifying population differences in early social-emotional health may be fundamental to understanding how gaps in children's early development persist and even become exacerbated into adolescence and adulthood. The proposed study follows a cohort of children from school entry to early adolescence and poses the following questions: Does early social-emotional health (i.e., social competence and emotional maturity) predict children's later health and achievement outcomes differently depending on children's gender, socioeconomic status, or English-as-a-Second-Language status?  And can specific developmental assets in children's early environments (e.g., supportive relationships with adults and peers, proper nutrition and sleep) mediate these trajectories? The findings have potential to inform policies and identify intervention opportunities to improve children's life chances across a population."
Predicting risk of endometrial cancer during reproductive aging,"['Tindale, Lauren']",['N/A'],"['Biomarkers', 'Endometrial Cancer', 'Predictive Modeling', 'Reproductive Aging', 'Risk Predictors', ""Women'S Health""]",,443403,"Endometrial cancer is the most common gynecological cancer in the developed world. Age and obesity are two main risk factors for endometrial cancer, along with co-existing health conditions and factors that affect hormone levels such as history of taking birth control pills or pregnancy. As women age, they experience normal changes that can also be signs of cancer. Women need to better understand their risk of gynecological cancers and recognize when they are experiencing normal reproductive aging and when they should seek medical attention.

In large population and longitudinal datasets, we will use risk models to predict the incidence of endometrial cancer and its precursor lesion, endometrial hyperplasia. Identifying women who are at high-risk for cancer will allow for targeted interventions to promote prevention along with early detection. We will also improve the risk models by exploring how additional factors, such as socioeconomics, ethnicity, environmental exposures, and other health conditions contribute to endometrial cancer risk.

We also aim to understand whether digital tools, used in combination with at-home molecular tests, will be accepted by women with elevated cancer risk as a way to self-monitor. To address this, 100 participants will take part in a 6-month self-tracking digital health study, providing data on risk factor questionnaires, tampon, and blood collections at two time-points for comparison. We will also explore whether women are open to following recommendations for prevention and screening from AI-based predictions.

An enhanced risk model could reduce the incidence and mortality of endometrial cancer in Canada. Risk for cancer increases with age, however other risk factors can be modulated through lifestyle modification, medication, and surgical prevention. Self-tracking apps could also integrate with health care to empower women to become more aware of what to expect as they age and be proactive in their personal and medical choices."

The region has suffered over 80% of AIDS-related deaths, yet despite efforts, the epidemic continues. Not only are countries devastated by the epidemic, but their development status and high proportion of other vulnerabilities among their populations compromises whatever defences they have. Mozambique, for example, has prevalence rates ranging from 3-35%, with a national estimate of 16%, predominantly heterosexual infections. Mozambique is characterized by poor knowledge of HIV/AIDS, lagging access to preventive and therapeutic services relative to the rest of southern Africa, compounded by the world's most severe health worker shortage. Exacerbating factors include inadequate education systems, poverty, and gender inequality. HIV/AIDS disproportionately affects women, through infection and social role, rendering the epidemic a women's issue. What remains unclear is exactly how these multiple factors interact to make HIV/AIDS both a sociocultural and epidemiological problem in Mozambique. To explore the complex mix of factors influencing HIVAIDS among women in Mozambique, I will use grounded theory, informed by situational analysis methods of mapping relationships, discourses, and action, to identify how the intersections between and among factors such as gender, colonization, race, poverty, politics, food insecurity, health policy, economics, culture, and globalization impact HIV/AIDS in Mozambican women. Study findings will inform programming and care for women affected by HIV/AIDS, and can further inform donor, NGO, and national policies on prevention and planning of health and social service delivery for vulnerable women in Mozambique."

As in the case of earlier analysis by Tompa et al. (2010a), claims information from the WSIB administrative files will be linked to the Longitudinal Administrative Databank (LAD), which is a 20% simple random sample of Canadian tax filers. Based on our previous work, we expect to identify approximately 19% of this frame in the LAD. For each claimant we will identify a sample of uninjured counterparts that have similar socio-demographic characteristics and earnings profiles prior to the injury year using rigorous control matching techniques. We will then evaluate the impact of temporary and permanent impairment on work disability for various strata, namely age bracket, sex, region of residence, occupation, pre-injury earnings, level of impairment rating, and nature of injury. Comparison of claimants to controls will ensure that factors other than the work injury and ensuing health deficit are adequately addressed in the analysis of work disability. The analysis will evaluate work disability and the adequacy of supports received under the current and previous workers' compensation programs in Ontario using various statistical techniques. Previous analyses we have undertaken considered injured workers receiving benefits under a program that was in place in the 1980s and another in place through most of the 1990s in Ontario. The proposed study will allow us to evaluate how impairment, work disability and benefits adequacy in the current program compares to the earlier programs. This information will be invaluable to better design supports that minimize the impact of injury and the ensuing health deficit on work disability. Sub-group analysis will also provide insight into how to better target supports."

Data are surprisingly lacking on the long-term physical and psychological symptoms, symptom management problems, and their associated distress after treatment for CRC. Although symptom management programs have been developed for other cancers, none exist for long-term CRC survivors. Therefore, this project makes a novel contribution to the survivorship care planning of this population by examining symptom severity and symptom management problems in long-term CRC survivors and designing and implementing a symptom management intervention."

These challenges are even more pronounced in younger BC survivors who are at an increased risk of poor quality of life(QOL) relative to that of older women. This can cause a disconnect between young survivors' current self-perceptions and their pre-illness identities, leading to distress as they feel unable to live up to their ideal selves. To date, no studies have investigated identity as a predictor of improved psychosocial adjustment. The aim of this investigation is to examine whether identity integration, defined as the reformation of post-illness identities, is a significant predictor of psychosocial adjustment among young breast cancer(BC) survivors. Identity integration will be used as an umbrella term to measure two key concepts associated with psychological adjustment: a)the integration of the illness experience into identity, and b)the integration of traditional gender roles into identity. A mixed methodological design will be used to assess identity integration as a predictor of psychosocial adjustment. A total of 150 participants will complete a battery of standardized measures to assess this relationship; a subsample of 20 participants will complete semi-structured interviews to elucidate the lived experiences of young BC survivors' identity integration processes. By exploring identity integration as a predictor of psychosocial adjustment in young BC survivors, this research can aid health practitioners in providing counselling and educational services that empowers young women to learn how to maximize their health, QOL, and longevity. In turn, these services may foster self-nurturing appraisals that build self-worth, increase acceptance of past trauma, and grieve for aspects of a former self to make room for a reintegrated self."
Molecular epidemiology and gonorrhea transmission dynamics: Implications for prevention and control,"['Trecker, Molly A']",['N/A'],"['Biostatistics', 'Disease Transmission', 'Epidemiology', 'Gonorrhea', 'Infectious Disease', 'Modelling', 'Sexual Networks', 'Sexually Transmitted Infection', 'Social Network Analysis', 'Sti']",105000.0,257395,"Gonorrhea infection poses a significant public health threat and is the second most common sexually transmitted infection (STI) both internationally and in Canada. In 2009 Saskatchewan had the highest gonorrhea rate of any province, and well over double the rate in many other provinces.

Gonorrhea and other STIs are not uniformly distributed across sexually active populations. Rather, transmission patterns reflect sexual networks and inter-relationships within defined groups of people. Analysis of these networks can reveal key individuals or core groups responsible for sustaining infection within the network and indicate the best targets for intervention.

The objective of this research is to link molecular data (information about transmission of specific strains) and traditional epidemiological data (contact tracing, social network analysis) to develop a new approach that will improve understanding of gonorrhea transmission patterns in populations. Analysis of this information will reveal transmission patterns, significant risk factors for transmission, and effectiveness of current and potential strategies for prevention and treatment.

Molecular and epidemiological data from China has already been collected and analysis is underway. Molecular data from Saskatchewan also exists; the next phase of the project involves collecting the epidemiological data for Saskatchewan. The existence of two datasets allows for comparison of the techniques developed through this research to determine their applicability on a global scale. The high rate of gonorrhea and rapid rise of other sexually transmitted diseases-including HIV-in Saskatchewan highlights the importance of understanding transmission dynamics and using this information to develop better prevention and treatment protocols in the province, the country, and internationally."

We will do a systematic review on relationship between physical activity and health in preschoolers because we want to create recommendations (also known as guidelines) for parents, educators, and governments to help them provide the best opportunities for preschoolers to be active and healthy. At the moment, Canada does not have physical activity guidelines for children younger than 6 years old. Our team has a lot of experience doing systematic reviews and we have already made guidelines for children older than 6 and who are in school. We will start by finding all of the studies that have looked at physical activity in preschoolers and that have included some measure of health, like being overweight. We will pay close attention to how these studies say physical activity is done by preschoolers, like how much, how often, and how hard or intense. We will even include studies that look at play because we recognize that play is a critical aspect of development in young children.  
After we collect all of this information, we will share it with the people who can really use it. We will hold a special meeting and we will invite people from government (who make policies), from national organizations like ParticipACTION (who promote physical activity), and from provincial groups like Best Start (who serve as a resource for parents). Together at this meeting, we will agree on what kind of physical activity is needed to optimize health in preschoolers and transform those recommendations into easy-to-understand guidelines. At the end of this meeting, we expect to have the first ever Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines for Preschool-aged Children (0 to 5 years). These guidelines will be based on the best available science. Ultimately, parents, care-providers, educators, and governments from around the world can have the highest confidence in Canada's guidelines."

Food security has been recognized as a determinant of health. Food insecurity exists when people do not have adequate physical, social or economic access to food as defined above. Position papers on food security in Canada point to the unique food security challenges faced by Aboriginal people living in remote-northern communities. However, the types of interventions in the northern communities have been limited (e.g., conventional gardening). At present, the barriers to the consumption of healthy foods, such as, fruits and vegetables are availability (quality when available) and expense, as identified by First Nation Cree of the Mushkegowuk Territory (western James Bay region of northern Ontario). Our innovative intervention strategy will increase the availability and consumption of vegetables and fruits in sub-arctic First Nations through agroforestry stewardship practices, which can help to improve nutrition and well-being of the people. Agroforestry has been utilized in the tropics, sub-tropics, and temperate climates, as a means to establish or increase food availability in impoverished areas using socio-economic and ecologically sustainable strategies. As the sub-arctic is disproportionately being affected by climate change, there is now an opportunity to employ agroforestry stewardship practices in this region. Agroforestry is a recent term for an ancient practice of combining woody perennials (e.g., trees, shrubs) with crops in spatial and temporal arrangements that optimize beneficial biological interactions and economic outputs. Being more diverse, and thus more resilient to environmental disturbance than conventional agriculture, agroforestry stewardship has the potential to act as a more reliable local-food system, and a refuge for culturally significant plants."

These sleep problems can create parental fatigue and frustration, but the specific impacts of these problems on young children themselves have not been investigated. The proposed research project will examine the impacts of brief sleep restriction (delaying bedtime by about half an hour each night for 3 nights) and sleep fragmentation (waking a child up for about 15 minutes each night, 3 nights in a row after he or she has gone to sleep) on preschool children with regular sleep schedules. The impacts will be measured through attention and memory performance in children who have experienced either brief sleep restriction, brief sleep fragmentation, or no change to their regular sleep schedule. This project will help clarify the clinical significance of sleep problems in young children, which will inform both diagnosis and intervention guidelines for pediatric sleep problems."
"Rates, Mechanisms, and Indicators of Youth Suicide Contagion in the Digital Age: A 20-year Population Study in British Columbia","['Turner, Brianna J']","['Erickson, Anders C', 'Liu, Sam X']","['Population Health', 'Social Media', 'Spatial Epidemiology', 'Suicide', 'Youth']",240976.0,402211,"Despite rising public awareness, suicide remains a leading cause of death among youth aged 10-29 worldwide. Youth are especially vulnerable to suicide contagion, where their risk is elevated through direct or indirect exposure to suicidal peers, and to suicide clusters. Suicide clusters can have devastating impacts on peers, families, and communities. Although we know that suicide-related content is often shared and discussed on online and social media, we don't yet know how this has affected patterns of suicidal behaviour in youth. The aims of this study are to: (1) examine whether rates or mechanisms of suicide clustering have changed with rising use of online and social media by youth; and (2) identify early indicators of clustering to improve monitoring and intervention. We predict that use of online media will produce more diffuse exposures to suicide among youth, which will result in suicidal behaviours that are clustered in time but not space. It is expected that population-level healthcare utilization and online behaviour may indicate when and where suicide clusters are about to occur.
This study uses population-level health and administrative records to gather a comprehensive picture of suicidal behaviours in over one million youth, aged 10-29, living in BC between 1998-2017. Analyses will use spatial statistics to detect clustering in space (geographic) and time (temporal). Analyses will also examine how rates and patterns of suicide clusters have changed over the past two decades, with special attention to how patterns may have shifted since online and social media became prominent methods of communication among youth. This study addresses several important gaps in knowledge regarding whether, when, and why suicide clustering occurs in youth. Findings will inform monitoring, prevention, intervention and public policy efforts that can reduce the global health burden associated with youth suicide."

These impacts, combined with rising prevalence of known suicide risk factors such as unemployment and financial hardship, social isolation, alcohol and substance use, relationship strain and domestic violence, have raised concerns that of rising suicide risk in the Canadian population. Canada loses 3,800 to 4,500 lives to suicide each year. Suicide death and bereavement confer long-term psychological and social risk to families and communities. A small increase in suicide rate can thus result not only in excess loss of life, above and beyond the direct impacts of the pandemic, but also confer long-term vulnerability in our communities. To support efforts to increase targeting of mental health resources to specific demographics, regions, and groups, this study aims to characterize the specific mental health and related cognitive impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic responses to inform evidence-based policy that can mitigate secondary suicide risk. We will recruit 5,000 community adults, with balanced representation of across age groups (10-year age bands from 19-29 to 70-79), sexes (male, female), geographic regions, and household incomes. Surveys will focus on Canadians' emotional, physical, and cognitive wellbeing across distinct phases of the pandemic (Summer 2020; Fall 2020; Winter 2021). In addition, we will co-create supplemental surveys to assess the mental health vulnerabilities, resilience, and lived experiences with three potentially vulnerable groups: frontline mental health workers, Indigenous peoples, and people living in rural or remote areas. Supplemental surveys will be developed with knowledge users and community members so they are relevant and responsive to community needs. Our results can inform mental health strategies by identifying where, with whom, and what kind of intervention is needed to effectively reduce suicide risk."
Adverse Childhood Experience and Multisystem Cumulative Biological Risk in Middle and Late Life in Canada: The Protective Role of Psychosocial Resources,"['Uddin, Jalal']",['N/A'],"['Biomarkers', 'Cardiometabolic Profile', 'Childhood Adversity', 'Chronic Disease', 'Toxic Stress']",135000.0,440474,"Childhood toxic stress increases the risk of morbidity and mortality decades later. Childhood toxic stressors have been linked to increased inflammatory biomarkers, adverse cardiometabolic profile, greater sympathetic nervous system activity, and accelerated cellular aging. Despite evidence that childhood stress is associated with increased dysregulations across multiple physiological systems, few studies have examined the cumulative physiological toll of childhood stress on health in later life through a multisystem perspective. Further, research shows that individual and neighborhood level protective resources can guard against stress in impacting health. However, no Canadian studies have explicitly examined whether psychosocial factors and neighborhood amenities buffer/guard against childhood stressors in impacting chronic biological risk for diseases in mid-to-late life. This study will address these gaps by studying the long-term effects of childhood adversities on chronic health conditions. Further, we will examine whether adult social support, psychological well-being, education, and neighborhood green space buffer against childhood stressors in impacting chronic health conditions. We will use a database from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging. This research will provide critical information that will inform social interventions and public health programs aiming to prevent chronic diseases. Specifically, study findings will inform efforts to improve the adverse childhood experience screenings in the clinical setting and accelerate healthy aging through promoting individual and neighborhood level resilience resources."
Patterns of Resilience Among Youth in Contexts of Petrochemical Production and Consumption in the Global North and Global South,"['Ungar, Michael', 'Burke, Sarah L', 'Cox, Robin S', 'Reid, Steve J', 'Theron, Linda C']","['Cook, Philip H', 'Fabricius, Christo', 'Gifford, Robert', 'Khan, Jahanzeb M', 'Schnurr, Matthew', 'Strand, Lola E', 'Weinberg, Joanne', 'Wolfe, Cindy']","['Carbon Cycle', 'Climate Change', 'Community Resilience', 'Complex Systems', 'Economic And Social Benefits', 'Environmental Resilience', 'Environmental Risk Factors', 'Petrochemical Industries', 'Resilience', 'Youth']",50000.0,342557,"Whether at the extraction end of the carbon cycle, or at the consumption end, the petrochemical sector has a large impact, both positive and negative, on social, economic and environmental systems that affect young people's mental health and social wellbeing. Accordingly, it is crucial to identify and enable those processes that protect young people's health and wellbeing while moderating or eliminating processes that have a negative influence. To do so, three multidisciplinary and multisectoral teams in Canada and South Africa (the global north and south) will study the resilience of young people and its relationship with the petrochemical industry at both ends of the carbon cycle. Teams of scholars and community and industry co-applicants will examine the interactions between the psychological resilience of young people, family and community resilience, and the resilience of environmental systems over a period of several years. We expect that a systemic understanding of the petrochemical industry's impact on multiple social determinants of youth health can increase the potentially positive impacts of extraction industries (e.g., employment, community cohesion) while mitigating the negative consequences of oil and gas production (e.g. finding better ways to help youth deal with social disruptions and forced migration). Simply put, we want to learn how young people adapt across the carbon cycle and use what we learn about their patterns of resilience to improve the lives of all young people. Four communities (two Canadian, two South African) will facilitate this research-based learning. The selected communities have been identified because of their involvement in petrochemical production or because they are known to be affected by post-consumption climate change. Young people and Local Advisory Committees will play a key role in the research, contributing to the research design and the development of age and culturally relevant knowledge mobilization strategies."

Impact of nutritional labelling on menus: a quasi-experimental study.,"['Vanderlee, Lana M']",['N/A'],"['Calorie Labelling', 'Labelling Policy', 'Menu Labelling', 'Nutrition Labelling', 'Nutritional Information']",150000.0,247740,"Obesity is a growing public health problem. Recent estimates indicate that one-quarter (25%) of adult Canadians are obese and an additional 37% are overweight, while more than one quarter of Canadian children and youth are either obese or overweight. Food consumed at restaurants and fast-food outlets accounts for a growing proportion of dietary intake among Canadians, and is believed to be an important contributing factor in the obesity problem. Currently, Canadians receive little or no information regarding nutritional content of restaurant food. The Ottawa Hospital has recently implemented a novel nutrition labelling program, which includes calorie and nutrient amounts, as well as a healthy eating symbol directly on menu boards. The Hospital has implemented this program at one site and will be implementing the program at a second site in 2012. The current study will examine the impact of these nutritional labelling interventions using a quasi-experimental design, collecting data at both sites before and after implementation.  Exit surveys will be conducted with 500 cafeteria patrons at each site at baseline and at follow-up, for a total of 2,000 participants. Sales data, provided by The Ottawa Hospital, will also be collected over a 6-month baseline and follow-up period at both sites. The study will examine the effect of nutritional information on awareness of calorie and nutrient content, consumption of calorie and nutrients and the extent to which the influence of nutritional labelling varies by socio-economic status and among sub-groups in the population. This study is among the first to examine nutritional labelling of menus in Canada and has the potential to inform provincial and federal level policies on nutritional labelling. Overall, the study will help to evaluate the impact of point-of-sale nutrition labelling using a rigorous research design in a naturalistic setting."

Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the physical activity and sedentary behaviours of this young population. Worst still, children and youth from equity deserving groups (e.g., particular groups or communities that identify barriers to participating in society such as, girls, newcomers to Canada, and children with disabilities) were unevenly impacted by COVID-19 in terms of physical activity and sport participation, access, and opportunities.While what we know about children's physical activity levels continues to grow, less is known about how this knowledge is shared with public health professionals and community stakeholders best positioned to do something with the findings; and this is particularly true among equity-deserving groups. Team efforts are required to ensure materials are tailored and customized to equity-deserving groups to maximize impact. As such, this grant aims to organize a group of national experts, stakeholders (including individuals with lived experiences), and marketing and communications specialists to develop a suite of materials and products that can be used to help share key findings from the 2022 ParticipACTION Report Card on Physical Activity for Children and Youth and provide tips and tricks for encouraging and supporting healthy behaviours in children, including equity-deserving groups. This grant provides an opportunity for a timely and unique collaboration between research, public health, and health marketing/communication experts, in collaboration with community stakeholders, to improve physical activity among children and youth in Canada, with the focused inclusion and application of an Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) lens.

Aligning government support programs with realities of vulnerable young women: a structural approach to HIV prevention in Botswana,"['van der Wal, Ran']",['N/A'],"['Botswana', 'Hiv Prevention', 'Improvement Implementation Research', 'Mixed Methods', 'Participatory Reseach', 'Structural Intervention', 'Vulnerable Young Women']",2500.0,368476,"Despite considerable investment in HIV control, 22% of adults in Botswana are HIV+ and thousands continue to contract HIV every year. Women are especially affected; in the age group 15-29 years, up to 74% of HIV+ persons is female. Conventional HIV prevention measures fail, as many young women are unable to negotiate abstinence or condom use, due to structural factors, such as poverty, lack of education, and gender violence. 
Botswana NGO, CIET Trust, and the National AIDS Coordinating Agency address these underlying drivers of HIV through a national HIV prevention trial called INSTRUCT. As part of INSTRUCT, my research project aims to tailor existing government support programs to lived realities of those most at risk of HIV infection: vulnerable young women (15-29 y.; unemployed/out-of-school). Access to support programs that offer small business opportunities or back-to-school programs would empower them, thus enabling them to protect themselves against HIV. Unfortunately, few vulnerable young women benefit from these programs, as these programs are not designed for them.
I therefore explore why they do not benefit from support programs and how we can improve their access. We use innovative methods whereby vulnerable young women and program officers map underlying causes; subsequently analyze these maps and co-design solutions. This information is then presented to national policy makers who decide which solutions to implement. After their implementation in intervention districts, I assess whether co-designed solutions contributed to improved access. Through national surveys, the larger INSTRUCT trial will measure whether HIV prevalence reduced in intervention districts compared to districts without intervention.
A first national level trial of its kind, my research project represents an historic opportunity to learn whether including vulnerable young women in policy design is an effective way of finding feasible solutions to reverse the global HIV epidemic."

"The Mental Health of Youth Born at High Birth Weight and Subjected to its Maternal Determinants: A Multi-National Study of Prospective, Longitudinal Cohorts","['Van Lieshout, Ryan J']",['N/A'],"['Birth Weight', 'Child And Adolescent Mental Health', 'Developmental Psychopathology', 'Epidemiology', 'Intrauterine Exposures', 'Maternal Health', 'Prenatal Risk Factors', 'Primary Prevention']",165000.0,178846,"Nearly one in five children suffers from mental illness and 50% of adult psychiatric patients have met diagnostic criteria for such disorders in childhood. Exposure to physiologically stressful environments in the womb can result in high birth weight and influence the development of organs and organ systems in ways that can be lasting or permanent. In fact, babies born at high birth weight may be at increased risk for a number of medical problems later in their lives. Recently, it has been suggested that the environment of the womb can affect brain development in such a way that the offspring of these pregnancies are at increased risk of psychiatric disorders, even when genetic risk is taken into account. 

If the medical problems affecting mothers during pregnancy that increase the risk of having a high birth weight infant (eg. obesity and diabetes) also increase the risk for psychiatric illness in the offspring of these pregnancies, we might be able to prevent or reduce this by treating mothers for such problems prior to or during pregnancy. Such intervention might not only reduce the enormous burden that mental disorders impose on sufferers and their families, but could also lessen the associated costs borne by health care systems and society as a whole. 

The current project seeks to determine if the maternal medical problems that result in high birth weight or if high birth weight itself are associated with particular psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents or if they increase risk broadly. We would like to understand the early life pathways through which this risk is expressed and if these differ between boys and girls. The proposed research will therefore not only identify prenatal targets for prevention, but determine who is at the greatest risk and why, as well as inform how we might reduce the proportion of children born at abnormally high birth weights who go on to develop mental illness later in life."
Menopause and physical function in older women from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) and the International Mobility in Aging Study (IMIAS),"['Vélez, Maria Del Pilar']","['Alvarado, Beatriz E', 'Belanger, Emmanuelle', 'Pirkle, Catherine M', 'Richardson, Harriet']","['Cognitive Function', 'Epdemiology', 'Menopause', 'Physical Function']",70000.0,352984,"In Canada, as in the rest of the world, poor physical function increases after 50 years of age, with a peak at age 65.  Poor physical function is a key determinant of poor physical and mental health, greater risk of institutionalization, and mortality.
 
Poor physical function appears earlier and at greater frequency in women than in men. Current research suggests that experiencing menopause earlier in life and having surgically-induced menopause (removal of the ovaries before menopause), rather than natural menopause, is related to lower physical function. Our objective is to assess the relationship between age at menopause, and type of menopause (surgically-induced vs. natural) on physical function in older women (65-74 years) in Canada and globally. In addition, we aim to investigate the role of physical activity, hormone therapy, cardiovascular disease, social support, and resilience on the relationship between menopause and physical function.

We will use baseline data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging Comprehensive cohort (CLSA, 7 cities across Canada) and the International Mobility in Aging Study (IMIAS, 5 cities around the world). By analyzing these different cohorts of women, we will be able to identify risks related to poor physical function in women with a broad range of experiences across the life course, as well as different social norms and expectations. 
 
With an aging population and an overburden to health systems around the world, targeting physical function and looking for determinants that can reduce loss of function in women at older ages, we will offer new avenues for more effective ways of intervention. In this regard, we expect our results could further inform research and clinical actions exploring the benefits of physical activity, hormone therapy, and early intervention that targets better social opportunities for women before menopause."

However, child adversity is common, with recent Canadian prevalence estimates of child abuse at 27% to 32%,[12-14] and severe household dysfunction at 49%.[13] Since CVD is a leading cause of death in Canada,[15] the potential effect of ACEs is far more significant than previously thought based on these prevalence rates.[12,13] Yet how ACEs amplify the risk for CVD later in life remains unclear. Recent reviews all conclude that CVD risk factors such as smoking, physical activity, nutrition, obesity, diabetes, hypertension and family history cannot adequately explain this connection. Instead, they direct future research to focus on the interaction between psychosocial factors and physiological systems. As such, the primary objective of this project is to examine the role of ACEs on preclinical measures of cardiovascular health and development from childhood to early adulthood and to examine how both psychosocial factors and physiological mechanisms combine to explain this relationship."

The reduced risk of transmission speaks to pregnancy being a less risky option for HIV+ women with appropriate medical care and assistance from the health care system (as reproductive aid is necessary to prevent transmission to a partner). HIV+ women have been found to desire to have children at similar rates as HIV-negative women, however their actual pregnancy outcomes have not yet been examined. The current study will examine what proportion of HIV+ women who intend to have children become pregnant over a two-year period, and will compare this group to a matched HIV-negative group of women.

The Health Implications of Meaningful Occupations in Low-Income Racialized Communities: A Comparative Analysis of Halifax & Toronto,"['Waldron, Ingrid R']",['N/A'],"['Community Engagement', 'Health Equity', 'Inequality', 'Interviews', 'Poverty', 'Race']",65446.0,193459,"The main objective of this research is to compare and contrast Halifax and Toronto by looking at how access to and participation in meaningful occupations in two low-income and poor racialized communities in Halifax and Toronto are shaped by race, low-income and poverty, gender, immigrant and refugee status, age and other social factors in the context of the historical, structural and institutional practices and policies in both cities.  The concept of meaningful occupations in the discipline of occupational therapy emphasizes the therapeutic benefits of participating in occupations that are meaningful and valuable.  

The project`s other objectives are: 1) to identify how the concept of meaningful occupations is conceptualized and articulated by low- income and poor racialized communities; 2) to identify barriers to and opportunities for accessing and engaging in meaningful occupations in low-income and poor, racialized communities; 3) to determine how access to and engagement in meaningful occupations impacts on the emotional, spiritual, mental and physical health and well-being of these individuals; and 4) to identify the health policy implications for engaging low-income and poor racialized communities in meaningful occupations.  

Through purposive and snowball sampling, we will recruit members of low-income, racialized communities in Halifax and Toronto to participate in one-hour in-depth interviews. All transcribed interview data will be thematically analyzed. Our findings will be shared with government, non-profit health and community organizations."
Psychosocial predictors of acute rejection in adult transplant recipients,"['Walker, Hope A']",['N/A'],"['Chronic Stress', 'Coping', 'Health Psychology', 'Immunology', 'Psychobiology', 'Transplant']",105000.0,184692,"Kidney transplant is the only successful treatment for patients with kidney failure, with a high patient survival rate and slightly lower transplanted organ survival rate. Across Canada, 2963 people were on the waitlist for a kidney transplant in December 2007. Kidney donation is becoming an increasingly scarce resource, and patients may wait years for a donor. This is due in part to the increasing number of re-transplants - more and more people are requiring a second, third or even fourth kidney transplant. After a kidney transplant, the patient's immune system recognizes the new kidney as foreign, and tries to reject it. To prevent this from happening, patients take medication for the rest of their lives, but this is not always entirely effective. The patient's body can still try many times to reject the new kidney and over time, there might be permanent damage to the transplanted kidney, and the patient might need a new transplant. It's not always clear why organs are rejected, and it could be that psychological factors such as anxiety and depression play a role.

At the moment, there is very little research which studies the effects of a patient's psychological functioning on the likelihood of the transplanted kidney being rejected. It could be that episodes of rejection are influenced by a patient's psychological functioning before or after surgery. If we can identify psychological factors contributing to re-transplant, interventions can be designed to try and prevent organ rejection. The goal of this research is to study the relationship between psychological variables and rejection for kidney transplant recipients. Psychological variables of interest are perceived stress, anxiety, depression, social support, and coping. This unique study will determine the impact of various psychological factors on kidney graft rejection via biological pathways, and is therefore a valuable first step in identifying relevant psychological variables for intervention."

It is designed to increase capacity for action on the determinants of health at local, provincial/territorial and national levels. Three editions of the Profile have been published in 1989, 1994 & 2000.

At two stakeholder consultations (October 2006; April 2009) participants agreed on the need for an updated, online Profile to facilitate knowledge transfer among government agencies, voluntary sector organizations, health/social service professionals, researchers, corporations & parents to improve outcomes for Canadian children, youth & families. The Profile would become a central repository of credible research on child & youth health, providing the ability to monitor important health & well-being indicators of children & youth in Canada. Such a system does not currently exist in Canada.

To develop the new on-line Profile the IWK Health Centre & the Canadian Institute of Child Health, working with 100+ voluntary expert advisors, will accomplish the following objectives:

-Development of Profile protocols-e.g. data collection, analysis, on-line formats
-Acquisition of relevant, reliable data sets and research
-Development of a raw data management system for development of Profile chapters
-Development of a user-friendly network platform onto which the full Profile will be built
-Development & publication of a Contextual Chapter

The online Profile presents an opportunity to facilitate the transfer of knowledge among Canadian researchers & knowledge users to deliver high quality statistical information, research findings & policy discussions. The on-line format brings it within reach of any researcher & knowledge user with internet access, including Canadian families, allowing for a continuously evolving data source that will help improve outcomes for Canadian children and youth."

Using accurate research to make decisions about where to spend health dollars is essential because it ensures that monies are well spent and have the biggest impact for mothers and children. However, research shows that decisions that donors like Canada and poor countries make about where to spend money are often not based on the best evidence. The proposed project, conducted over 2 years, will explore the challenges in generating and using evidence that Canadian and international decision-makers face when prioritizing programs for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health. Information will be collected in Canada, Uganda and Ghana through interviews with decision-makers and a review of reports used to plan health services. Since Canada is investing significant funding and resources in International Maternal, Newborn and Child Health, it essential that decisions about where to invest are made by considering accurate and credible evidence. The information gained from this study will ensure that decisions about international health spending are fair, effective and ultimately improve the health of mothers and their children."
Psychotropic Medication Use and Ectopic Pregnancy,"['Wall-Wieler, Elizabeth']",['N/A'],"['Administrative Claims Data', 'Ectopic Pregnancy', 'Epidemiology', 'Psychotropic Medication']",140000.0,392226,"In up to 2% of pregnancies, the embryo implants and begins to develop outside of the uterus - this is referred to as an ectopic pregnancy (EP). These pregnancies are extremely painful, can result in serious complications, and are responsible up to 13% of all pregnancy-related deaths. EPs occur when  the fallopian tube environment changes, preventing the embryo from moving to the uterus. Since the embryo moves through the fallopian tube by muscle contraction and ciliary beating, exposures that affect either of these mechanisms could potentially result in EP.
This study is the first to look at whether the risk of EP is higher for women who use SSRIs, a common type of antidepressant that can affect ciliary beating in the fallopian tube, or benzodiazepines, a common type of anti-anxiety drug that can affect muscle contractions in the fallopian tube. The rate of SSRI and benzodiazepine prescriptions are rising, but virtually nothing is known about the impact of these medications on early pregnancy outcomes such as EP. This study will use large administrative claims databases of over 2 million pregnancies and advanced methods to make considerable strides toward understanding, and potentially reducing the incidence of, EP. 
The findings from this research are important contributions to the fields of perinatal epidemiology and pharmacoepidemiology. Since EPs never progress past the first trimester, they are largely neglected in both fields. Given the serious outcomes associated with EPs (complications and death), this topic deserves a lot more attention. The rate of EP is high in Canada, ranging from less than 1% of reported pregnancies in Prince Edward Island, to more than 3% of reported pregnancies in the Northwest Territories. The findings from this research can contribute towards guidelines for the prescription of SSRIs and benzodiazepines for women of reproductive age in Canada."

Despite increased mental health services and antidepressants use in the past 10 years, there has been no measurable change in the prevalence of MDE in the Canadian general population, which motivates the search for additional strategies for reducing the burden of MDE. One strategy that has been successful in the fields of oncology, cardiology and diabetes is early identification and prevention - identifying people who are at high risk and taking preventive actions to lower the risk so as to prevent symptoms from progressing into a MDE. As multivariable risk prediction algorithms are used to estimate an individual's risk (probability) of future disease, they can play an important role in the process of early identification. The proposed study stems from a project funded by an operating grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR). With the CIHR support, the team developed and validated sex-specific prediction algorithms for MDE. As risk prediction is at very early stage in psychiatry and MDE is still highly stigmatized, to facilitate the future implementation of the developed risk prediction algorithms, the proposed study seeks to answer the following research questions: (1) Does disclosure of personalized depression risk information promote high-risk individuals to take preventive actions? (2) Will disclosure of personalized depression risk information negatively affect high-risk people's mental health status in terms of increased psychological distress? To answer the questions, we planned to conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with an embedded qualitative component. The proposed study will develop an evidence base for guiding the disclosure of personalized risk information and understanding the process of risk communication and consumer empowerment, contributing to the advancement of early prevention of MDE in Canada."

We have established how essential Indigenous community leaders are in the delivery and uptake of health and wellness information. As such, our interventions have been designed such that Indigenous community leaders are the key knowledge translation brokers. We recognize that the long- term sustainability of these interventions is challenging, particularly in remote and rural regions. Also, our Indigenous community leaders have acknowledged the need for advanced and on-going training to ensure a self-sustaining model wherein community leaders are the key advocates for health change. Accordingly, this proposal seeks to examine the effectiveness of a novel experiential and community-based learning program for healthy lifestyle behaviours within Indigenous communities.

Understanding the Impact of Osteoarthritis on Depression in the Canadian Population,"['Watson, Tristan']",['N/A'],"['Causal Inference', 'Depression', 'Multimorbidity', 'Osteoarthritis', 'Pain', 'Population Health', 'Social Determinants Of Health', 'Survey Methods']",105000.0,439412,"In Canada, a major public health concern is that osteoarthritis (OA) and depression affects millions of Canadians, and both conditions co-occur in about 20% of adults. Most people know a friend or loved one whose quality of life has been negatively affected by either of these two chronic conditions. OA pain symptoms and depressive symptoms are two of the leading causes of disability in adults. The double burden of having both OA and depression further compromises a person's quality of life and severely limits activity.

There has been inconclusive evidence regarding the assertion that OA can lead to subsequent depressive symptoms facilitated through pain. In addition, there has been a lack of available Canadian data sources to examine the relationship between OA and subsequent depression in a population of adults where variables are measured across different time points (also known as a longitudinal study).

There is a great opportunity to better understand the relationship between OA and depression, by using recent data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA). The CLSA provides pan-Canadian data that has information on OA, depression, pain, and other key variables. I will study the temporal relationship between OA and subsequent depressed mood using statistical methods appropriate for longitudinal data.

A cure for OA does not exist at present, but it is possible to minimize the impacts of this debilitating health condition. Current OA treatment is focused on pain management, but it is not clear whether pain management is effective at dealing with the psychological consequences of OA. The study results will help to clarify the risk of developing depressive symptoms among people with OA, in order to improve the lives of people with OA, by informing OA clinical management (e.g., screening tools for depression) and supporting health services planning (e.g., social support programs)."

The strength of the CLSA cohort for my research topic is the large longitudinal cohort, information about OA diagnosis and symptoms at multiple joints, valid measure of depression (i.e., CES-D), and a broad range of clinical and socio-demographic information. This SPA training will also be relevant to other OA data sources career (i.e., Osteoarthritis Initiative and the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study) that I also plan to use in my research. 

My current doctoral program in epidemiology has equipped me in advanced quantitative and research methods that I will apply to learn analytic approaches to longitudinal data in the SPA training program. By participating in this training program as a first-year doctoral student in epidemiology, I will receive a solid foundation for my dissertation proposal on how to frame my research objectives, and an awareness of potential strengths and weakness of different methodological approaches using CLSA data. Public health is built on collaboration and knowledge gathering, and the training I will acquire through the SPA will include gaining exposure to the scientific community while attaining applicable knowledge and technical skills (i.e., grantsmanship, knowledge translation) required to further my career as an academic scientist.

My career goal is to become an academic scientist and epidemiologist. I am pursing doctoral studies because I desire to increase my research abilities, to teach graduate students, to lead independent research, and to improve health outcomes for people with OA. OA is of deep interest to me and is increasingly relevant to an aging population."
A Longitudinal Examination of the Home Food Environment and Weight Status,"['Watts, Allison W']",['N/A'],"['Adolescents', 'Home Food Environment', 'Longitudinal', 'Nutrition', 'Obesity']",100000.0,301540,"A growing body of evidence suggests that the home food environment contributes to adolescent obesity risk. The lack of longitudinal research on familial determinants of obesity has left a gap in our understanding of the contributors to adolescent obesity and how the context of the home food environment influences weight status into adulthood. The objectives of this research are to: 1) Identify the mix of home food environment characteristics that are carried forward over time and result in a more favourable weight status in adulthood; 2) Identify differences in how home food practices are carried forward in time by males and females; and 3) Examine intergenerational associations in adolescent weight status among parent-child pairs to see if the home food environment contributes to these associations.

These objectives will be met by analyzing data from Project EAT (Eating Among Teens), an ongoing prospective study that followed 2,500 young people from adolescents to adulthood. Project EAT collected extensive information on the home environment, weight-related behaviours and weight status, as well as information about participant's children. Home variables of interest, assessed by questionnaire, include support for healthy eating, parenting practices, meal patterns (eating with the family, eating out, type of foods served at meals), modeling, and availability. A combination of self-reported and measured height and weight will be used to calculate body mass index (BMI) and BMI z-scores. 

Longitudinal models of adolescent obesity are rare and contribute stronger evidence for making public policy and intervention decisions. The findings from this study will address gaps in our understanding of how the home may promote or reduce risk of adolescent obesity and will provide information to families so that they can create home environments that promote healthy weights in order to decrease future chronic disease risk."

These beer promoters are rural-to-urban migrants who are vulnerable to sexually transmitted infections and unplanned pregnancies as many supplement their income selling beer with sex work. The study will investigate the multiple factors that facilitate or are barriers to sexual and reproductive health care services by research teams in each of the four countries. In phase one, focus groups with beer promoters, policy makers, and health care providers in sexual and reproductive health care will inform the choice of a health care institution for a case study (i.e. a popular location for beer promoters to seek sexual and reproductive health care services). The phase one data will also inform development of a survey for beer promoters. In the second phase, beer promoters attending the chosen institution will be surveyed. The survey will focus on information about the beer promoters and their behaviours, in addition to their experience of access to sexual and reproductive health care at the case study institution (e.g. location, costs, health care provider knowledge and attitudes, etc). Document review and interview of key staff members will complete the case study. This research will provide a comparison of the challenges obtaining sexual and reproductive health care for migrant beer promoters in these four south-east Asian countries, and will guide future program and policy initiatives to improve access to sexual and reproductive healthcare for this vulnerable population of women."

Interviews will also be done with those who work directly or indirectly with these primary care doctors, including the specialist physicians, nurses, physiotherapists, provincial agency representatives, patients and their family members. The results from this study will be shared with a diverse group of stakeholders and knowledge translation strategies will be devised, implemented and evaluated in order to improve care delivery across the province. This approach has the potential to both advance the science of knowledge translation research and improve clinical practice, with the ultimate goal of improving the health of patients and their families suffering from chronic pain."

However to date many of these patients have been drawn from middle class families and may therefore not represent those patients who are poor and who because of their poverty may have different issues to deal with in managing their health conditions. Our team previously spoke with family physicians about the work they do in caring for patients with chronic pain. From them we learned that many of the patients they find most challenging to help also suffer from poverty, mental health and addiction. While these findings from our first study had profound implications for how patient care is delivered in Ontario, we did not specifically speak with patients and thus cannot know with confidence how our findings may effect them. Our current research proposal will therefore be aimed at understanding the experiences of patients with chronic pain, who are also dealing with mental health issues, addiction and/or poverty, in order to better understand how the social context of their lives might impact how they are (or are not) able to manage their chronic pain. We would like to know what they consider to be the most pressing priorities and needs from their perspective. We will then use this important information to significantly improve chronic pain delivery in Ontario in ways that are sensitive to the needs and experiences of these patients. We hope that these improvements should ultimately help improve the health of all Canadians and also help future researchers be able to collaborate with a more diverse range of patients in their studies.

Neurodevelopmental effects of prenatal PBDE and PFAS exposures in US and Canadian children,"['Webster, Glenys M']",['N/A'],"[""Children'S Environmental Health"", 'Endocrine Disruption', 'Environmental Chemicals', 'Neurodevelopment', 'Perfluorinated Compounds (Pfass)', 'Perinatal Epidemiology', 'Polybrominated Diphenyl Ethers (Pbdes)', 'Pregnancy']",90000.0,319272,"Nearly 100% of Canadians are exposed to PBDE flame retardants and PFAS stain repellent chemicals, yet very little is know about their longterm consequences for human health. Animal studies suggest that these hormone-mimicking chemicals can have long-lasting effects on neurodevelopment. Exposures during early pregnancy are of particular concern, because the developing fetal brain is extremely sensitive to small changes in hormone levels during this time. My research will examine whether the levels of PBDEs and PFASs in pregnant women from 2 birth cohorts (in Canada and Cincinnati, Ohio) are associated with adverse behaviours and lower cognition scores in their children. Study results will help to guide regulatory decisions about these chemicals in Canada and around the world."
A comparative history of chronic disease in the 20th century,"['Weisz, George']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Chronic Disease', 'Invalidity', 'Policy', 'Poverty', 'Welfare']",,189182,"Chronic disease has been an important category for understanding illness since ancient times. But in the 20th century it has assumed a central role in policy discussions and proposals for reform, particularly in North America. Surprisingly, no one has thoroughly analyzed how and why the idea of chronic disease has assumed such critical importance to our current understanding of modern medicine. While historians have discussed the history of many individual chronic diseases, the meta-concept ""chronic disease"" has remained a black box, something taken for granted rather than critically examined.  The purpose of this project is to fill this gap by exploring the 20th-century history of this concept in comparative perspective. The central hypothesis is that meanings and associations of ""chronic disease"" have changed repeatedly since the 19th century and have evolved differently in the three countries under consideration, the United States, Great Britain and France. And central to its development has been the relationship and boundaries between the social welfare and medical arenas"

Different countries and regions have introduced policies, guidance and legislation to improve sex/gender analysis and consideration in clinical trials.  In Canada, Health Canada has recently updated its guidance for inclusion of women in clinical trials, however, there is little data on the effects of previous Health Canada guidance on consideration of sex and gender in clinical trials, nor how this addresses barriers to improved consideration of sex and gender in clinical trials conduct and interpretation.  We are interested in assessing the current state of sex/gender analysis and consideration in Canadian-funded clinical trials, including those funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research as well as other governmental and non-governmental organizations. Specifically, we will: (1) conduct an environmental scan of the state of sex and gender analysis in Canadian-led and funded clinical trials; (2) conduct a targeted stakeholder consultation using an online survey;  (3) hold a planning meeting to develop a plan for a larger operating grant on assessing the state of sex and gender analysis in Canadian-funded clinical trials. This planning process is critical to shape the future research based on the needs of identified stakeholders. We anticipate that the subsequent research project will contribute robust evaluation of the effects of policy guidance on sex/gender health research in Canada in relation to clinical trials, as well as barriers and facilitators to improving consideration of sex and gender in clinical trials.

Research has shown that education about aging can support the development of age-consciousness in students - i.e., a deeper understanding of the aging process, a reduction in and increased awareness of ageism, and an enhanced personal connection with aging (Russell et al., 2022). However, there are not yet any studies that explore the role of intergenerational connectivity, in the development of age-consciousness. To address these gaps and build upon the novel age-conscious student concept, the aims of my master's thesis are two-fold: (1) to evaluate participants' experiences in an intergenerational classroom pilot and (2) to explore the impacts of intergenerational connectivity on age-conscious development in students and classroom volunteers. Intergenerational focus groups will provide rich insight into participants' experiences with the classroom pilot, and individual interviews will explore the role of intergenerational connectivity in age-conscious development. This project will contribute to understanding of intergenerational connectivity at the institutional level while providing students and classroom volunteers with valuable intergenerational experiences. This project will also add to the scholarly understanding of age-consciousness and provide research that will lead to the development of future intergenerational classrooms while addressing the larger-scale issue of ageism."

Investigating the impact of drug policy reform on HIV-related risk behaviours and access to methadone maintenance treatment among injection drug users in Mexico,"['Werb, Daniel M']",['N/A'],"['Drug Policy', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Injection Drug Use', 'Methadone Maintenance Treatment', 'Mexico', 'Mixed-Methods Research', 'Multilevel Modeling', 'North America']",150000.0,269683,"The illicit drug trade in North America continues to proliferate, with the three countries of the continent - Canada, the United States, and Mexico - responding to the risk for HIV and other drug-related harms among injection drug users in a variety of ways. Perhaps the most acutely affected is Mexico, marked by high levels of drug-related violence since the 2006 launch of a national ""War on Drugs"". In light of ongoing violence and HIV transmission, in August 2010 Mexican policymakers passed a law decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of illicit drugs, and stipulating that repeat drug offenders be sent to addiction treatment or, barring that, to jail. However, concerns exist regarding implementation of the law, given that addiction treatment has yet to be adequately scaled up. As such, the law has been met with both praise and criticism regarding its potential for unintended consequences. The proposed project would therefore investigate the impact of this drug policy reform on risk of HIV transmission and addiction treatment access among injection drug users in Tijuana, a town on the Mexico-United States border disproportionately affected by injection drug use and HIV. Observational data from cohort participants will be employed to determine to what extent policy reforms have been implemented, and to assess their impact on indicators of HIV risk and other negative health and social outcomes. This data will be supplemented by population-level census data on variables such as mortality, health, and median neighbourhood income, in order to conduct multilevel analyses that will provide further context for the health and social outcomes observed. Further, in-depth interviews with a subset of cohort participants who report being arrested will be analyzed qualitatively to provide a comprehensive mixed-methods approach to determining the impact of drug policy reform on the health of injection drug users in Mexico."
Preventing Injecting by Modifying Existing Responses (PRIMER),"['Werb, Daniel M']",['N/A'],"['Addiction', 'Drug Markets', 'Gender', 'Hiv', 'Incarceration', 'Injection Drug Use', 'Injection Drug Use Initiation', 'Mixed Methods Research', 'Opioid Substitution Therapy', 'Supervised Injection Facilities']",300000.0,340870,"Injection drug use remains a primary source of HIV transmission globally, and people who inject drugs (PWID) have been shown to play a key role in the initiation of others into injecting. However, no interventions to prevent injecting initiation are proven effective. Importantly, ongoing exposure to injecting increases the risk that street youth and other 'at-risk' populations might initiate injecting, and data suggest that the majority of non-injectors are initiated into injecting by PWID. Reducing the exposure of street youth to injecting is therefore likely to reduce their risk of initiation into injection. This multicountry, mixed methods project will therefore investigate whether a range of interventions and factors that influence injecting among PWID (opioid substitution therapy, supervised injection facilities, stable housing, incarceration environments, public injecting, and gender) may also influence the risk that they initiate others into injecting. This study will seek to: 1) determine how often PWID initiate others into injecting; 2) assess factors potentially influencing the risk that PWID initiate others into injecting; 3) investigate drug scene roles (i.e., drug dealer) that increase the risk that PWID might initiate others into injecting; and 4) test the impact of an existing structural or biomedical intervention on the risk that PWID will initiate others into injecting. To accomplish this, we will conduct a multi-site study of 3,050 PWID across North America and France employing quantitative and qualitative data from five separate ongoing observational studies of PWID (San Diego, STAHR; Tijuana, El Cuete; Vancouver, VIDUS/ARYS; Toronto, HHiT, Bordeaux/Marseille/Paris, COSINUS). This project is the first study to investigate structural approaches to reducing HIV risk by preventing injecting initiation. This novel approach addresses a major gap in HIV prevention programming."

This overdose epidemic claimed almost 15,000 lives between 2016 and 2019, and in response Canadian municipalities, including Toronto, developed a network of harm reduction, clinical and social services to try to prevent these deaths. However, starting in March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has created major barriers that prevent people who inject drugs (PWID) from accessing these services and avoiding illness and death. This includes the closures of supervised injection facilities, lack of access to clinicians to provide addiction treatment, and a lack of stable housing which makes it difficult to engage in physical distancing. Simultaneously, Toronto experienced a spike in overdoses in March and April, reversing a year-long trend of declining overdoses, which appears to be related to the COVID-19 pandemic and its restrictions. It is not known, however, exactly how PWID are being impacted and how services need to be changed to prevent them from succumbing to the ongoing epidemic of overdose and the COVID-19 pandemic. This project is using a unique research tool to explore that issue: the only cohort of PWID in Canada that has full linkages to individual clinical data. We are therefore able to rapidly assess people's clinical outcomes--including COVID-19 diagnosis, overdose, loss of access to addiction treatment, and the severity of other health conditions--to their self-reported behaviours. By doing so, we can understand the many ways that the COVID-19 pandemic is directly affecting this vulnerable group, and identify those at highest risk of both  COVID-19 and overdose, and how these risks interact. To understand the population-level impact of the pandemic on PWID  in Toronto, this study will also track how distancing restrictions are impacting the use of services to prevent overdose across the city, including addiction treatment access, supervised injection services, and street drug checking."

The goal of the ongoing Toronto Disparities, Overdose and Treatment (T-DOT) study is to understand whether rapid implementation of new opioid agonist treatments and an impending drug decriminalization policy change are effective  in reducing overdose risk among people who inject drugs who are experiencing severe socioeconomic disparities. To do that, the T-DOT study will link behavioral data collected over time from a cohort of people who inject drugs in Toronto with administrative datasets that include comprehensive clinical data from all Ontarians. This is important because currently, data from people who inject drugs about their treatment and other clinical experiences is almost always collected as self-report, making it difficult to confirm clinical outcomes. However, high-quality, comprehensive clinical data is needed to chart an evidence-based pathway to end the overdose epidemic in Canada and across North America, particularly for people who inject drugs experiencing socioeconomic disparities."

Residual or 'hangover' effects of either substance on road safety are not well understood but may be substantial. In a recent study, drivers with alcohol hangover but no other evidence of substance use constituted 18% of a group of police-identified suspected impaired drivers. In our ongoing study of cannabis effects on driving, we have seen preliminary evidence of residual effects up to 48 hours following cannabis use. To date, little information on the combined effects of alcohol and cannabis is available, and the residual effect of combined use has not been examined. This study will examine the acute effects of alcohol and cannabis on driving and the residual effects 24 hours later. Fifty subjects aged 19 to 25 will complete 8 experimental sessions (2 sessions/week). Each week subjects will complete one session with alcohol/drug exposure and simulated driving trial and one session 24 hours later with driving trial only. The order of alcohol/drug conditions will be randomly assigned and will include: 1) placebo cannabis/placebo alcohol, 2) placebo cannabis/alcohol, 3) cannabis/placebo alcohol, and 4) cannabis/alcohol. The target blood alcohol content will be 0.08%. A single dose of cannabis will be administered at 12.5% ± 2% THC. Subjects will be social drinkers and regular users of cannabis, but not heavy/problem users, and must be free of health concerns that would contraindicate use of alcohol or cannabis. Effects on mood and cognition will also be assessed. Studies show that cannabis and alcohol are often used together by young drivers. Identifying factors that affect the collision risks of this population is a public health priority."

Many Indigenous women lack the opportunity to participate in exercise and do not have access to, or engage in, local health programs.
     A community led, physical activity-based wellness program for Indigenous women has been running for 4 years in three communities in Alberta.

How do urban activity spaces and food environments affect the food shopping behaviours and health of young Canadian adults,"['Widener, Michael J']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,368196,"There is an increasing amount of evidence that urban activity patterns can facilitate or restrict a person's ability to acquire and consume different types of foods, and thereby their health. Given this, it is important to develop a thorough understanding of how exposure to urban food retail environments over time and across space influences dietary decisions for various demographic groups. While past studies have begun to acquire data that describe activity patterns through various sources (e.g. GPS), they tend to be limited by 1) data collection periods being of insufficient length (e.g. 1 - 3 days) to understand food shopping habits, 2) relatively small sample sizes, 3) populations with variable demographics, and 4) focusing on a single city or region. The research presented here will use data from a GPS subsample of the national Canada Food Study, conducted in 2016 and focused on 16-30 year olds, to address some of these issues.

Records of approximately 450 young adult participants, collected for one week across five Canadian cities (Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Edmonton, and Halifax) are used to explicitly address the links between activity patterns, the food retail environment, and food shopping behaviours. In addition to the seven days of GPS data and food purchasing data, we have variables from an in-depth survey on participants' dietary history and health. With this integrated dataset, three primary questions will be answered: First, what socioeconomic variables affect the count of different types of food retailers in participants' activity spaces? Second, does exposure to a larger quantity and variety of food retailers affect participants' use of particular types of food retailers? Third, is there a significant relationship that exists between access to different types of food retailers, use of those retailers, and health?"

What is less known is how the restrictions that governments have requested to ""flatten the curve"" may have affected the mental, social and economic health of the population. Recent reports suggest that within populations, there is inequality in how these restrictions have been experienced. For example, job losses are gendered (UN, 2020; Statistics Canada 2020a) and racialized (NPR 2020). Concentrated outbreaks-in meat packing plants, and in long-term care homes have been reported widely in all three countries (Bragg, 2020, Reuters 2020). Racialized peoples are also overrepresented in industries where COVID-19 infections are more likely such as food service and manufacturing, hospital and long-term care staff (IOM 2020; Block and Dhunna, 2020). Because the virus preys on people in vulnerable situations such as overcrowded housing and work stations, these conditions are frequent among racialized persons, Indigenous persons and newcomers, our project answers two central questions: 1) How have COVID-19 related government imposed regulations differentially influenced the mental health and well-being of Indigenous peoples, racialized persons and immigrants? And 2) to what extent have socioeconomic inequalities faced by Indigenous peoples, racialized persons and immigrants influenced their experience of COVID-19 and its related social and economic restrictions? Given our connected borders and interconnected cultures and people, we argue that success rests upon our ability as a continent to work together to protect one another and eventually eradicate this virus which necessitates the three country comparison of Canada, US and Mexico.

Role Strain for Caregiver-Employees: Exploring an E-Mental Health Solution,"['Williams, Allison M', 'Garland, Deb']",['N/A'],"['Anxiety', 'Caregiver-Employees', 'Caregiver-Friendly Workplaces', 'Depression', 'E-Mental Health Decision Tool', 'Fatigue', 'Mental Health', 'Role Strain', 'Well-Being', 'Work Stress']",75000.0,361030,"Building on the work we are currently undertaking via a CIHR operating grant which evaluates caregiver-friendly workplace interventions on caregiver-employees (CEs) working full-time at McMaster University, we propose an innovative, evidence-based, gender-responsive and culturally-appropriate E-mental health solution to address role strain and the consequent psychological distress for CEs.  The E-mental health solution proposed is a Tool which, using user characteristics, determines actionable outcomes to assist with the management of role strain and psychological distress.  Actionable outcomes could include education about government and workplace programs, health & community support services, and self-care. The vision is that this Tool be: user-friendly; animated; fun to use; life stage and gender/sex responsive; culturally appropriate; evidence-based (via testing & evaluation); bilingual; has integrated API, and; tailored to the profile and needs of the users (CEs and their employers) across the workplace."
"Health, Equity, and Literacy for Aboriginal Youth","['Williams, Keri L']",['N/A'],"['Equity', 'First Nations Communities', 'Health Literacy', 'Youth']",550.0,331946,"In Canada there are many claims that Aboriginal peoples, specifically First Nations, are particularly vulnerable to low levels of health literacy. These claims are relevant to the health of First Nations communities not only because of evidence indicating that Aboriginal Canadians have poorer health than their non-Aboriginal counterparts but also because health literacy has been identified as an important determinant of health. Indeed low levels of literacy in health settings have been linked to poor clinical and health outcomes. Unfortunately to date there has been little research into the determinants, components and outcomes of First Nations health literacy. Furthermore, how health literacy is constructed, understood and utilized by First Nations peoples has not been extensively studied and no adequate definition exists that takes into account First Nations' theoretical perspectives and approaches to health and healing. Therefore, this session will describe the development of a constructivist grounded theory study to address these knowledge gaps. It will discuss how community engaged scholarship is being used to guide the development of a theory of health literacy that is grounded in the perspectives of First Nations youth. A critique of the current health literacy literature will be provided using a critical, decolonizing lens and the challenges and opportunities of integrating critical social theory with First Nations ways of knowing to address this health inequity will be presented. Furthermore, a discussion around the use of rigorous qualitative methods in Aboriginal health research will be facilitated."
Supporting Canadian Veterans with Service Dogs,"['Williamson, Linzi']",['N/A'],"['Canadian Veterans', 'Service Dogs']",342573.0,477734,"This proposal is an extension of prior CIHR-funded research my patient partners and I conducted on spousal and family involvement in service dog training programs, publicly enacted stigma towards people with disabilities (e.g., veterans with PTSD and comorbid SUD) paired with service dogs, public knowledge of service dogs and their handlers, and veteran and civilian experiences with navigating the Canadian service dog industry. Three studies will be conducted that answer the broad research question: How can we improve the lives of Canadian veterans with PTSD and comorbid substance use who are working with service dogs? For Study 1 a course and protocol will be developed and tested to aid Canadian service dog organizations in involving families in all aspects of service dog acquisition, assessment, training, certification, and retirement, including determining the needs of family and significant others and protocol for service dog organizations to assess the family context will be developed and tested. For Study 2 educational interventions/informational products will be developed and tested to educate various Canadian demographic groups (e.g., youth, elderly, etc.) about service dogs and their handlers. For Study 3 educational interventions/informational products will be developed and tested to aid handlers in improving the bond with their service dogs. The Bowen Family Systems Theory, Theory of Planned Behaviour, Human-animal bond, zooeyia, and Five Domains of animal welfare will inform this research. Methods employed will include online questionnaires, follow-up interviews, and focus groups to develop the interventions/informational products, and experimental designs to test the developed products. Findings have the potential to improve Canadian service dog training programs, inform Canadian policy regarding service dogs, inform animal welfare improvement initiatives, and improve the lives of veterans, and their families and service dogs."
REsearch and ACtion for Healthy Cities (REACH-Cities),"['Winters, Meghan']",['N/A'],"['Equity', 'Gender', 'Healthy Cities', 'Population Health Intervention Research']",285000.0,454122,"The REsearch and ACtion for Healthy Cities (REACH-Cities) program is focused on how cities can welcome and support people of all genders -especially those of age, racial, income, or ability groups who have historically been overlooked within city planning. The research spans the implementation and impacts of population health interventions (e.g., municipal transportation and community planning policies, to on-the-ground changes to the built environment such as new rapid transit and bicycle facilities, to programs to support social connections and physical activity) and focuses on the health-related outcomes that pattern by gender and other intersectional identities. There are three connected themes of work: 
A.Generate new knowledge on the implementation and impacts of healthy cities interventions, using a gender-based intersectional lens (Population Health Intervention Research)
B.Develop and apply novel approaches for integrating gender equity into decision-making in local, national, and international settings (Methods and Tools for Intersectoral Action)
C.Foster a generation of changemakers, equipped with the expertise to catalyze action toward cities that promote health and health equity for all people. (Training for Healthy Cities)

REACH-Cities is designed as a responsive program, adopting community-engaged research methods to ensure it reflects both urgent needs and timely opportunities. My primary partners are local government decision-makers: those responsible for designing and building healthy cities. Outputs will empower partners with relevant evidence on their pressing needs around gender equity; embed change in how equity is considered within city planning processes and actions; and train the next generation of healthy cities researchers and practitioners to advance action on gender equity. Collectively, these impacts will shape a host of future interventions that serve to improve urban environments for all genders."
"Mediating effects of age and gender on shift work, fatigue and cognitive performance","['Wong, Imelda S']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Gender', 'Ics Travel Awards', 'Shift Work', 'Work Injury']",610.0,324177,"Over the past two decades, there has been a significant change in the Canadian workforce: the number of workers over the age of 55 has more than doubled, and 50% more women are employed. At the same time, global economic demands and the need for 24 hour services has also lead to a steady growth of workers employed in schedules outside of regular '9 to 5' hours.  The combination of all these factors has lead to a dramatic increase of older adults and women who currently work night shifts. 

Working shifts for prolonged periods can lead to sleep impairments and substantial aging of the brain. These effects can continue long after workers stop night shifts and may take years to return to normal. For older workers, who may have spent a majority of their careers in nonstandard schedules, this may be especially problematic. Combined with the natural biological aging of the brain, shift work may accelerate some aspects of cognitive decline, hampering worker safety and productivity in the later stages of their careers, and affect their health and well-being in retirement. For women, the effect of shift work on cognitive decline may be similarly accelerated.  It has been suggested that compared to men, women may spend more time on family responsibilities, like child care, and that the added demands of working nights may affect sleep health and cognition. However, this still remains to be explored in scientific studies.
  
This proposed research builds upon my prior studies on shift work, gender and work injury. National Population Health Survey data will be used to examine if lifestyle and work-related factors, such as child-minding and occupation, may impact sleep differently for men and women who work shifts. I will also explore gender differences on how sleep affects thinking and memory, and if age may explain or enhance these differences. Study findings will help identify if additional safety precautions or education should be considered for specific groups of workers."
Aboriginal youth living with HIV: From diagnosis to learning to manage their health and lives,"['Woodgate, Roberta L']","['Cochrane, Carla', 'Payne, Michael J', 'Dean, Ruth A', 'Migliardi, Paula', 'Mignone, Javier J']","['Aboriginal Youth  With Hiv/Aids', 'Ecomaps', 'Experiences And Needs', 'Focus Group Interviews', 'Health And Social Service Care Providers', 'Health Services', 'Interviews', 'Phenomenology', 'Photovoice', 'Support Person(S)']",100000.0,286224,"Receiving a diagnosis of HIV changes your life; learning to cope and adjust to the diagnosis and the early years following can be challenging. Moreover, Aboriginal youth often face these challenges alone due to fear of stigma and discrimination, and they are less likely to access services. If we hope to provide both timely and appropriate interventions for Aboriginal youth living with HIV from diagnosis to the early years of living with HIV, research is needed that details their experiences and perspectives during the critical period of HIV diagnosis and early years following. The purpose of this study is to arrive at an increased understanding of the experiences and needs of Aboriginal youth living with HIV from diagnosis to the first five years of living with HIV. Primary participants are Aboriginal youth who have been have been living with HIV from one to up to six years following the diagnosis. Some of the ways we will collect information include interviews combined with photovoice, which is a process that involves Aboriginal youth taking photographs to document their experiences. Aboriginal youth's support person(s) and health and social service care providers will provide additional insights about the experiences and needs of Aboriginal youth living with HIV, and recommendations about services and programs offered to Aboriginal youth. The significance of this study is fourfold. First, new knowledge will emerge about the experiences and needs of Aboriginal youth living with HIV from diagnosis to the first five years of living with HIV. Second, this study will give a voice to those Aboriginal youth participating in the study. Third, the knowledge gleaned from this study may be used to improve quality and access to existing services and programs that are meant to enhance how Aboriginal youth manage and deal with HIV. Fourth, this study will provide a basis for future community-based intervention research directed at helping Aboriginal youth living with HIV."
Supported Housing for People with Severe & Persistent Mental Illness: Knowledge to Action,"['Woodhall-Melnik, Julia R']",['N/A'],"['Coordinated Care', 'Homelessness', 'Housing', 'Mental Health', 'Service Provision']",135000.0,318600,"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes the right to housing as part of the right to an adequate standard of living. But in most affluent societies a particularly vulnerable group, people with severe and persistent mental illness (SPMI), is systematically denied this right, in part because of their typically low incomes, but also because of the failure of social institutions to make reasonable accommodations that allow people to live with mental illness and still maintain housing. This proposed post-doctoral research program will focus on practical and systemic interventions for eradicating housing loss in persons with SPMI. This research encompasses detailed analysis of the daily skills needed to maintain housing and investigation of policy and system organization changes needed to provide adequate support for housing maintenance to more eligible people within current spending. This work will drastically improve the capacity of clinical staff, mental health workers, and housing practitioners to support persons with SPMI in remaining stably housed. Additionally, restructuring policy sectors to promote an integrated, coordinated, preventative approach to service provision will eliminate redundancy in expenditures and improve access to specialized and necessary supports for housing success in the Canadian population living with SPMI."
"Optimizing the Health of Indigenous Infants and Toddlers: Identification of Community Strengths, Needs and Priorities to Promote Early Childhood Development through Healthy, Gender Diverse Parenting.","['Wright, Amy', 'Butt, Michelle Lynn']",['N/A'],"['Early Childhood Development', 'Gender-Diverse Parenting Models', 'Healthy Parenting', 'Indigenous Parenting', 'Indigenous-Led Research']",68215.0,413012,"This Community Gathering will bring together the urban Indigenous community in Hamilton, Ontario to identify and prioritize research projects about the health of Indigenous parents and their infants and toddlers. The period of early childhood is very important to growth and development, and children who experience challenges during this time may go on to have poorer health and success as adults. Parents are responsible for meeting their child's needs and they must have the resources and skills they need to provide for their children. This Community Gathering will bring together parents of various identities (including mothers, fathers, adoptive parents, two-spirit parents and other gender-diverse parents), Indigenous leaders and health providers as well as Elders and Knowledge Holders to discuss the strengths, challenges and gaps related to healthy parenting and the early childhood development of young children in Hamilton. Through this Community Gathering we will (a) learn about healthy, gender-diverse parenting models and roles to promote healthy early childhood development and positive parent-child-community relationships; (b) strengthen partnerships and build relationships among Indigenous community members, organizations and researchers; and (c) inform a research proposal created together with members of the Hamilton Indigenous community to submit to a research grant competition. The proposed Community Gathering clearly aligns with the objectives of the CIHR funding opportunity, including: establishing priorities for an Indigenous-led research project related to optimizing child health and wellness through gender-diverse parenting, facilitating relationship building among Indigenous community members and researchers, and knowledge sharing on parenting from Indigenous Elders, Knowledge Holders and community members."

In addition to focusing on immediate clinical/biomedical needs relat-ed to the outbreak, it is also important to consider potential mental health impacts. Pregnancy can be a time of heightened vulnerability, especially during public health emergencies. Women may have several concerns related to: their health and fetus; the health of family, friends, and their infants; access to ser-vices; potential exposure during hospital deliveries; and social isolation, among others. Health care pro-viders (HCPs) also face mental, physical, and social challenges that can affect their wellbeing and ability to care for patients. Building on our team's existing research work and infrastructure, we will first assess the potential impacts of the COVID-19 emergency on pregnant women's mental health (depression) and the implementation of a perinatal depression and screening and management program in Ma'anshan, Chi-na. Secondly, we will then evaluate the effect of a cognitive behavioral therapy intervention aimed at re-ducing depression in pregnant women and investigate changes in the acceptability of and adherence to the intervention. Thirdly, we will investigate potential impacts in terms of adverse birth outcomes (preterm birth, low birth weight, small for gestational age) and explore women's experiences during the outbreak. Fourthly, we also plan to assess anxiety among HCPs and investigate the provision of perinatal health care during and after the emergency. This study aims to contribute to the global COVID-19 response, foster our understanding of the potential mental health impacts of the emergency, reduce public health risk and burden, and help inform clinical and public health responses to the outbreak."
Climate Resilience through Youth Engagement: A Participatory Approach,"['Zinszer, Kate A', 'Kaiser, David']","['Khan, Sabaa', 'Harper, Sherilee L', 'Knight, Rodney E', 'Labbe, Danielle']","['Climate Change', 'Community Resilience', 'Human Centred Design', 'Interventions', 'Mixed Methods', 'Montréal', 'Youth', 'Youth-Led Participatory Action Research']",125000.0,505783,"Children born in 2020 will experience two to seven times as many extreme climate-related events in their lifetime compared to those born in 1960. This generation faces record-high levels of anxiety, stress, and depression, driven not just by environmental concerns but also by the need to adapt to a swiftly changing social and economic landscape. Increasingly, evidence suggests that participation in climate resilience efforts can yield substantial advantages for youth and their communities. Using a youth-led participatory action research (YPAR) approach, this project aims to deepen our understanding of how climate change affects young people and to explore the benefits of their active engagement in climate-related activities, with a focus on enhancing mental health and community resilience. This study will occur in Montréal-Nord, one of Montreal's most economically disadvantaged and ethnically diverse neighbourhoods. We will recruit youth researchers aged 16-21 living in Montréal-Nord, who will be supported by adult mentors and workshops throughout the research process. The YPAR process includes five phases beginning with understanding community perspectives, followed by intervention development and implementation, evaluation, and model development. This involves youth exploring the potential issues they want to address related to climate change, which will inform the activity development and implementation that align with community interests and environmental needs. The final phase focuses on developing a replicable model of youth engagement in climate resilience. By engaging youth in climate resilience efforts, the study empowers them as essential contributors to their communities, potentially impacting their mental health positively. This work will help determine the potential for scaling up and out YPAR to other communities for climate change and for other public health emergencies."
