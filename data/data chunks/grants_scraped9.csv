Positive Aging: Indigenous peoples aging with HIV/AIDS,"['Ryan, Chaneesa R']",['N/A'],"['Aging', 'Community-Based Research', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Ics Travel Awards', 'Indigenous Knowledge', 'Indigenous Methodologies', 'Indigenous Peoples', 'Sharing Circles', 'Strengths Based Approach', 'Successful Aging']",2800.0,345919,"As a result of advances in treatment over the past 30 years, the number of older people living with HIV is growing. This is of particular concern for Indigenous populations in Canada, given continuing over representation in HIV diagnoses. While there has been an increase in research on aging with HIV within the general population, little is known about the experiences of older positive Indigenous peoples.

Research was done in partnership with the Canadian Aboriginal AIDS Network (CAAN) and was conducted in July 2015 in Vancouver, British Columbia at CAAN's Wise Practices V conference. Participants were conference delegates, representing a sample of First Nations, Inuit and MÃ©tis people living with HIV. Participants ranged in age from 32 to 63 and had been positive for 5 to 29 years.

This project utilized a community-based participatory research design, directed by community and informed by Indigenous knowledge's and methodologies. Data was collected through four sharing circles (two with women, one with men and one with service providers) and four individual interviews (n=34).  Our preliminary findings reveal several dimensions of health which facilitate successful aging (SA) within this population: physical, emotional, spiritual, mental and social engagement. While the dimensions which an individual must embrace in order to achieve SA are intricately connected, the emphasis that one places on each dimension is subjectively determined. Participants recognized the interconnectedness of the dimensions and the importance of finding the right balance between each dimension in order to actualize SA.

The goal of this project was to identify facilitators and individual strategies which enable SA within this population, in order to develop culturally mediated responses. Ideally, this knowledge can be used to help structure community and primary health services to promote SA with HIV in ways which are congruent with Indigenous culturally-defined notions of health."
"Establishing Research Priorities: An exploration of First Nations, Inuit and Metis women and gender diverse people's needs in Cannabis and Mental Health","['Ryan, Chaneesa R']","['Parisian, Dean', 'Ali, Abrar', 'Blake, Marisa', 'Cardinal, Claudette L', 'Gabel, Chelsea', 'Greene, Saara', 'Ion, Allyson', 'Meawasige, Amanda', 'Simmons, Marsha', 'Sjoblom, Jessica E']","['Cannabis', 'Gender Diverse People', 'Indigenous Health', 'Mental Health', 'Women']",,441587,"With the legalization of cannabis in Canada, there is an urgent need for information about its effect on the Indigenous population. The impact of cannabis on the mental health of Indigenous people in Canada is unknown. Currently, research on mental health and Indigenous people emphasizes the risk of suicide and opioid drug use, with little information regarding cannabis and its effects on mental health. To date, urban and off-reserve First Nations and Metis populations are dramatically underrepresented in research. Further, ways of evaluating mental health in the current Canadian health system differ from traditional Indigenous knowledge of assessing wellness. Applying a colonial lens to Indigenous communities and individuals' health status further marginalizes and stigmatizes the unique challenges experienced by First Nations, Inuit, and Metis people. Therefore, this research project will build on the work done by other Indigenous organizations' mental wellness assessments and further the evidence of the importance of cultural safety in promoting mental health. This project will help fill these gaps by establishing a network of multi-disciplinary experts that work closely with Indigenous people regarding mental health and cannabis. The online platform created will serve as a space where partners can come up with unified goals and research priorities around mental health, cannabis and indigenous women and gender diverse people. This project will identify research priorities to inform the development of larger research projects and create resources to fill some of the identified gaps. The research agenda on cannabis and mental health within the Indigenous population must be community-led and community-driven. By incorporating First Nations, Inuit, and Metis narratives and experiences into the evaluation of mental health and cannabis use, through Indigenous and decolonized methodologies, this project will be an important development for driving future research."
"Somatic and Psychological Symptom Focus in Asian-Canadians: The Role of Cultural and Individual Differences in the Psychopathology, Assessment, and Treatment of Depression","['Ryder, Andrew G']",['N/A'],"['Alexithymia', 'Culture', 'Depression', 'East Asian', 'Quantitative', 'Somatization']",300000.0,171677,"East Asians in Canada are often stereotyped as a model minority, with few psychosocial difficulties. The reality is that mental health problems in this population are underestimated and often treated inadequately. This problem has serious implications, both for the health of East Asian Canadians and also for the social and economic well-being of the country.

Recent research in East Asia and Canada has demonstrated that Euro-Canadians are more likely to present psychological symptoms such as depressed mood, whereas East Asians are more likely to present somatic symptoms such as fatigue. As a result, Western-trained clinicians in Canada are more likely to under-diagnose depression, with consequences for treatment and for the prospects of recovery. What is not clear, at present, is why these cultural differences are observed.

This project aspires to go beyond simple descriptions of cultural variation in an effort to unpack the underlying reasons for these different symptom emphases. In particular, these studies will examine the ways in which cultural values, beliefs, and assumptions shape one's focus of thinking - either internally, on one's on thoughts and feelings or externally, on other people and on social groups. Focus of thinking, in turn, is thought to influence the symptoms that depressed individuals focus on and find most distressing.

Understanding the reasons why East Asians and Euro-Canadians tend to emphasize different symptoms while depressed will not only improve the ability of Canadian clinicians to conduct more accurate assessments of depression in East Asians, but will also help us to develop culturally-sensitive therapies. The result will be quicker and more effective intervention, reducing the burden of depression on the patient, the family, and Canadian society as a whole."
The impact on female sexuality from emotional abuse and emotional-sexual abuse: A substudy of the Healing Journey Project.,"['Safinuk, Danaka R']",['N/A'],"['Emotional Abuse', 'Female Sexuality', 'Grounded Theory', 'Ics Travel Award', 'Intimate Partner Violence', 'Psychosocial Consequences Of Abuse', 'Qualitative Methods', 'Sexual Abuse', 'Women']",1731.0,263318,"ICS Travel Awards
Sexuality is a broad term that is used to include biological sex, sexual acts, sexual feelings, gender roles, and attitudes towards sex (Jackson & Scott, 1996). Sexuality is a dynamic construct that can be influenced by many factors, including experiences of intimate partner violence (IPV). IPV is one factor that can affect women's sexuality (Burgess, 1983; Faravelli et al., 2004). The focus of this qualitative study is to understand how IPV impacts women's sexuality in a sample of women who have experienced IPV. A review of the literature describes the many existing barriers that make it difficult for women to develop a positive sexuality, and discusses what role IPV plays in this development (Cobia et al., 2008; Faravelli et al., 2004; Meston et al., 2006). This research project examined IPV survivors' experiences of their sexuality by analyzing 31 qualitative interviews using grounded theory methods (Strauss & Corbin, 1998). The focus of this presentation will be on the effects of emotional abuse and e3motional-sexual abuse on sexuality for these 31 participants. The findings suggest that emotional abuse may be particularly damaging to sexuality. Resiliency factors have been found and will be discussed. These findings provide insight into female sexuality and IPV, specifically how emotional IPV impacts sexuality."
The risk of divorce for parents of children with autistic spectrum disorder: A scoping review on marital relationships,"['Saini, Michael A', 'Stoddart, Kevin P']","['Barrett, Deborah', 'Rampton, Glenn M', 'Muskat, Barbara L', 'Nicholas, David B', 'Zwaigenbaum, Lonnie']","['Autism Spectrum Disorder', 'Divorce', 'Evidence Of Outcomes', 'Marital Relationships']",47419.0,214161,"There is ongoing uncertainty about the relative impacts of marital relationships for parents of children with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) especially for those marital relationships that break down. To address this uncertainty with existing best evidence, this project will implement a scoping review of the literature reporting the risk and protective factors of marital relationships for parents of children and youth (<18 years) with ASDs. Although it has been sixty-five years since autism and Asperger Syndrome (AS) were recognized, the attention to the needs of families of affected children has been variable; we have made inconsistent progress in understanding the effect on families and on intervening most effectively. An ecological systems model of the family asserts that the strains experienced by one family member will resound in other parts of the system. For many years, we have recognized that having a child with a disability will affect parents, siblings and extended family members. All family members will experience their own processes of coping and grief, risk and resilience in response to emerging challenging events in the family system. If the family is the primary agent of socialization for the child, it is essential that we preserve and foster positive family functioning. Despite increased attention to the needs of children and youth with ASDs, families continue to independently navigate treatments and services, with many treatment approaches being home-based, parent-mediated and financial burdensome on the family. Increasingly, there is clinical observation that these marriages and families experience disproportionate levels of stress, and may be at heightened risk for divorce and separation."
Risk of urinary tract cancer from exposure to arsenic in drinking water.,"['Saint-Jacques, Nathalie']",['N/A'],"['Arsenic Contamination In Drinking Water', 'Cancer Risk', 'Geographic Information Sciences', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Population Health', 'Public Health', 'Risk Assessment', 'Spatial Statistical Modelling']",105000.0,229531,"Arsenic is found naturally in the environment and is known to cause cancer. Nova Scotia bedrock contains particularly large amounts of arsenic. Arsenic can enter surface and groundwater supplies and affect the health of people who rely on wells for their drinking water. In Nova Scotia, half of the population draw their drinking water from unregulated wells. In some areas of the province, the amount of arsenic in well water has been reported to be up to 100 times higher than the advisory limit set by Health Canada. However, the health risks associated with arsenic exposure in Canada are not known. Studies from elsewhere (e.g. Taiwan, Argentina, Chile, United States) show that high levels of arsenic in drinking water can cause cancers including those of the bladder and kidney. The occurrence of bladder and kidney cancer in Nova Scotia is amongst the highest in Canada. This research aims to measure the risk of developing bladder and kidney cancers as a result of drinking well water containing arsenic in Nova Scotia, Canada. It will also examine how other factors such as age, sex, body size, socio-economic status and lifestyle may influence the relationship between cancer risk and arsenic. To do this, data from the Provincial Cancer Registry and arsenic information from various government departments will be used. In addition, data on arsenic in the tap water and toenails of 5,000 people in Nova Scotia will be studied. This information will be used to show the relationship between the amount of arsenic in tap water and arsenic body burden, a necessary step to link arsenic exposure to cancer risk. The proposed research aims to improve the health of Nova Scotians and Canadians in general. It will support health and environmental policy; inform the public on the potential risks of well water supplies; and guide the development of a risk reduction strategy."
Longitudinal modeling of cognitive decline in a non-demented elderly population,"['Sajeev, Gautam']",['N/A'],"[""Alzheimer'S Disease"", 'Biomarkers', 'Biostatistics', 'Cognitive Decline', 'Cohort', 'Dementia', 'Epidemiology', 'Growth Mixture Modelling', 'Longitudinal', 'Public Health']",105000.0,257540,"Alzheimer disease (AD) and other dementias represent one of the most important public health challenges facing modern society. Presently, 36 million people worldwide live with dementia and this number is projected to reach 66 million by 2030, and 115 million by 2050. 

Cognitive decline is the primary symptom of clinical AD. However, the magnitude and rate of cognitive decline varies significantly between individuals. Little is known about what makes an individual follow a particular path of decline, or indeed the specific trajectories of these different paths. Statistical modeling of cognitive data obtained over time from groups of at-risk individuals is needed to identify these different paths. We propose using a new statistical methodology called growth mixture modeling, which can identify subgroups of individuals who follow similar paths, and are exploring several available longitudinal cohorts of at risk individuals that might serve as the discovery and replication datasets for this work. While cognitive decline is the defining feature of AD, researchers are increasingly using disease biomarkers and imaging data to study disease progression. There is similar variability in change over time in these measures, so this methodology will have application to those outcomes as well. 

We expect that identifying these paths will be useful in a number of important ways. It will help us to better characterize exactly who follows a particular path, and to identify risk factors associated with following a particular course of decline. Such knowledge could be of particular public health importance, given the failure of treatments at later stages of the disease. Additionally, we may be able to refine predictions of prognosis for individuals at earlier stages of the disease. Finally, it may also provide insights into the underlying causes of disease progression in AD."
Statistical Procedures to Assess Longitudinal Change in Domains of Health-Related Quality of Life,"['Sajobi, Tolulope T']",['N/A'],"['Discriminant Analysis', 'Health-Related Quality Of Life', 'Longitudinal Data', 'Variable Importance']",150000.0,177805,"Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is an important measure of the well-being of a person or group and is increasingly recognized as a valid marker of service need and health outcomes. Given the increasing morbidity associated with chronic disease that is occurring globally, there is significant interest among clinicians and public health professionals to understand how HRQoL changes over the disease course, and investigate the ways in which disease and disability affect HRQoL. Unfortunately, the analysis and interpretation of HRQoL is not straightforward. HRQoL is a multidimensional construct that encompasses physical, social, functional, and mental health; not all of the domains are equally responsive to changes in the disease state or level of impairment. Moreover in longitudinal studies, problems of missing data, subject loss, and outliers can invalidate results obtained using conventional methods of analysis. This research will develop and investigate statistical procedures to analyze multidimensional, longitudinal HRQoL data. It will focus specifically on procedures that can be used to discriminate between individuals or groups with different disease characteristics or health outcomes over time on multiple HRQoL domains. These longitudinal discriminant analysis procedures will be studied using computer simulation techniques and real-life data from a population-based longitudinal cohort study of individuals with inflammatory bowel disease. The overall goal of the research is to find the most appropriate procedure(s) for analyzing HRQoL data, to benefit health researchers and applied statisticians. The knowledge gained from studies of HRQoL is important for planning treatments and interventions that will have a positive impact on an individual's or group's health."

Scholars recognize, however, that improving sexual health and well-being is a complicated goal that requires increasingly complex theories and methodologies. This complexity is especially clear in the study of gender and biological sex, and sexual health, as sexuality scholars recognize the need to move beyond oversimplified models that conflate complicated interactions between biological, social, and psychological forces. Canada possesses some of the strongest sexuality scholars in the world, including those with considerable expertise in the study of health-related processes alongside gender and sex.  Canada is therefore well poised to lead the global field in the study and dissemination of sex research that is attuned to sex and gender influences and interactions. The annual CSRF routinely and recurrently attracts the largest gathering of Canada's highly accomplished sexuality researchers and their trainees. CSRF therefore provides the perfect opportunity to hold a knowledge exchange event to increase the existing capacities of Canada's sexual health researchers and knowledge users to conduct and apply cutting-edge research with respect to gender and sex. Preceding the 2019 annual meeting of the CSRF, in Victoria BC, we propose to organize a one-day pre-conference on Contemporary Theories and Methodologies of Gender and Sex for Sexual Health Research, in which we will connect leading Canadian researchers to trainees and new investigators through a knowledge exchange event focused on building capacity among Canada's sexuality researchers, therapists, educators, health promoters, and medical professionals. The events from this day will be recorded and content will be used to develop an open-access online training module."
Improving COVID-19 Vaccine Confidence and Uptake among Black Canadians,"['Salami, Bukola O', 'Sanni, Omolara B']","['Allen, Upton D', 'Renzaho, Andre M']","['African', 'Black', 'Caribbean', 'Covid 19 Vaccine', 'Participatory Action Research', 'Qualitative Research', 'Vaccine Hesitancy']",4328.0,451096,"Black Canadians have the highest rates of COVID-19 infection and death in Canada. Black Canadians also have the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rate in Canada. Two national surveys indicate Black Canadians are 20% less likely than White Canadians to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Some factors that contribute to COVID 19 vaccine hesitancy include lack of trust in healthcare professionals, lack of trust in vaccines, younger age, being female, low education, and being unable able to take time off from work. Improving the COVID-19 vaccination rate among Black Canadians is of high interest to policy makers and stakeholders. Our project seeks to address knowledge gaps related to COVID-19 vaccine confidence and uptake among Black Canadians and inform effective strategies to improve COVID-19 vaccine confidence and, in turn, uptake among Black Canadians. We will use a participatory research approach and consider diverse social determinants, including gender, socioeconomic status, and race/racism, throughout our data collection process. The project will be conducted in four phases. Phase 1 will involve interviews of Black Canadians. Phase 2 will involve a scoping review of the literature. Phase 3 will involve focus groups with stakeholders. Phase 4 will involve taking action through the co-development of knowledge translation tools. We will thematically analyze our qualitative data. Our project will result in the creation of a practice guideline, a policy guideline, and an e-learning module on strategies to address COVID-19 vaccination among Black Canadians. Our interdisciplinary team of experts in Black people's health, infectious disease control, qualitative research, scoping reviews, immigrant health, and participatory action research is well positioned to address this knowledge gap."

While these measures helped contain the spread of the disease months after its outbreak, the pandemic will have a long-lasting effect on  mental health of the youth. The pandemic poses a ""double whammy"" for Black youth, as they are at increased risk of mental health problems and Black Canadians are at an increased risk of contracting and dying from COVID-19. However, race-based data on the mental health of Black youth in Canada during or after the COVID-19 pandemic are not readily available. Our proposed work seeks to examine the mental health of Black youth after the COVID-19 pandemic and offer interventions to address mental health risks in this demographic. This project will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 will involve up to 30 interviews with Black youths to determine how the pandemic has affected their mental health. Phase 2 will involve a survey of Black youths in Canada. We will develop documentary videos, policy briefs, and webinars based on our findings. Our research will provide much-needed data on reducing the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Black youth.

We will apply a participatory action research approach and intersectionality perspective. Our project has four objectives. Our first objective is to review the literature and engage Black people in Canada as fruitful actors and co-creators towards ethical, culturally responsive, and impactful research on precision health equity for Black people in Canada. We will review the literature and interview 20 Black community leaders. Our second objective is to examine the association of gender, age, income, education, language, employment status, immigrant status, and other social demographic variables with the nutritional and metabolic status of Black Canadians. We will analyze the Canadian Community Health Survey to achieve this aim. Our third objective is to examine the association of sex, gender, age, income, education, language, employment status, and immigrant status with the nutritional status and health outcomes of Black Canadians across the life span. Our analysis of the Canadian Health Measures Survey, which includes physiological measures such as blood and urine tests, will enable us to achieve this aim. Our fourth objective is to examine how programs and policies can be co-developed to improve the nutritional status and health of Black people in Canada. We will conduct 130 to 260 interviews with members of the Black community and 13 to 26 focus groups with stakeholders across Canada. We will mobilize knowledge through annual stakeholder engagement days, guidance documents on nutrition, YouTube videos, and policy briefs."

These immigrants belong to diverse cultures and ethnic groups with unique beliefs, experiences, and needs. We know little about older Muslim immigrants living in Edmonton. Research shows that older Muslim immigrants experience challenges such as social isolation and lack of access to social and health services. Strengths for aging within Muslim communities can include family support, transnational connections, and personal and community faith. This research project will identify experiences and needs for healthy aging in Edmonton, Alberta, using a community based participatory approach. A Muslim community senior's advocacy group and various Muslim community organizations have voiced a need to address this research question and are participating in recruitment, data analysis, and development of final recommendations. We will conduct focus groups with older Muslims. We will, also, talk to people in the community who are formal and informal community leaders, activists, and volunteers. Immigrant women from visible minority groups are often the most vulnerable to negative health and social consequences in later life. We will use an intersectionality lens to address the interplay of gender, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity in shaping the aging experience. The study findings will identify needs and make recommendations to support healthy aging in this population."

Despite this, young people are rarely supported to draw on their lived experience to lead and participate in research and education related to cannabis use and its impacts on mental wellbeing in a way that responds directly to their concerns, priorities, and perspectives. This is particularly so for young people who are members of marginalized and equity-seeking groups, including those who identify as LGBTQ2S+, racialized and Indigenous youth, immigrant and refugee youth, youth in foster care, and youth living in poverty. With GREENHOUSE, we will generate youth-led evidence for action regarding youth mental wellness in relation to cannabis use. We will accomplish this with activities that are grounded in and responsive to young people's lived experiences. First, we will assess the current state of research on youth cannabis use and mental health in collaboration with youth. Following the evidence review, researchers, decision-makers, and youth will be engaged in discussions on the ways in which the current evidence resonates (or does not) with their experiences. From there, youth will be supported to undertake self-directed learning journeys on cannabis and mental health. Next, youth will apply their learnings from the two previous activities to the creation of youth-led theatre performances and community dialogues centred on youth mental health and cannabis use that will take place in schools and the community. Our Indigenous health partners will ensure that the project proceeds with concrete demonstrations of cultural safety and humility. We believe that this youth-led approach to research and education on cannabis use and mental health can be done in a similar manner across Canada, building a foundation for integrating youth voices in the topics that are important and relevant to their lives."

In Canada, evidence-based interventions that have been implemented to reduce risks associated with unwitnessed OD, such as supervised consumption sites, have largely been developed in urban areas, and are less appropriate for semi-urban and rural communities. 
Since 2018, we have built a solid foundation for community-based participatory action research (CB-PAR) in the Fraser East region of BC. We identified why and how people come to use drugs alone in this region, showing that relationships with loved ones are important mediators of decisions to use alone. We then examined family carers perspectives on stressors that fracture important relationships, leading to isolation of PWUD and using alone. We are now proposing the next extension of this work, to develop an intervention to equip family carers with the information, skills, and the connections they need to foster resilient relationships with PWUD and prevent isolation and using alone. Working alongside a network of peer researchers, services providers, and decision-makers, we will use a patient-oriented, community-based, participatory research approach to design and implement an intervention to foster resilience in relationships between loved ones, and to support loved ones to stay connected during crisis points, to reduce risks that lead to using alone and death due to unwitnessed OD.  Our aims are to:
1.Engage the community in dialogue to identify strategies and approaches for building PWUD-family carer relationship resilience during crisis points;

Mapping Social Networks for Translating Knowledge from Community-Based Participatory Research into Policy and Practice Change: The Impact of the Kahnawake Schools Diabetes Prevention Project,"['Salsberg, Jonathan S']",['N/A'],"['Community-Based Participatory Research', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Network Mapping', 'Qualitative Research', 'Social Network Analysis']",105000.0,257541,"Participatory research (PR) is an approach to research where academic researchers work in equitable partnership with those effected by the issue being studied, or with those who must eventually use or act on the knowledge created. PR thus integrates the translation of research knowledge into action for change by engaging these end-users at the beginning of the knowledge-creation process.

The action and change sought through PR is specifically intended to benefit its local stakeholders, yet findings must be able to be translated to other settings.

The success of PR efforts in creating action for change relies heavily on the formal and informal interpersonal and inter-organisational relationships that develop among its stakeholders. These relationships form a social network, defined as the pattern of ties existing among a set of individuals, organisations or other social actors.

An examination of this social network will thus give us insight into the process by which PR knowledge is translated into action for practice and policy change beyond the local context in which it was originally created and for which it was intended. Using the Kahnawake Schools Diabetes Prevention Project, a long-standing community-based health promotion PR project, as a case study, this proposed study will use social network analysis techniques to describe the network of relationships among the various stakeholders (individual and organizational), and the importance of these relationships in the dissemination or uptake of research findings into policy and practice locally, to the wider Aboriginal community, and throughout Canada more generally. This will lead to a better understanding of how research results move into practice, and of how to best use stakeholder-engaged research such as PR, to bridge the often large gap between what we learn from research and what we do in practice."
Inter-Organisational Collaboration for Scale-up of Intervention and Policy Programming in an Indigenous Community,"['Salsberg, Jonathan S']",['N/A'],"['Community-Based Participatory Research', 'Health Promotion', 'Indigenous Health', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Social Network Analysis', 'Type 2 Diabetes']",140000.0,358748,"This project will create and apply a framework that incorporates Indigenous ways of knowing and doing and the CIHR Knowledge-to-Action Framework, then apply the emergent Indigenous framework to (1) understand how community organisations collaborate to maximise impact of best-practice programming in areas of a community where it has previously had limited reach; and (2) to help improve collaboration between these community-based organisations.

Context and Setting: The Kahnawake Schools Diabetes Prevention (KSDPP), is a PHAC-Canada Best Practice Portal-Aboriginal Ways Tried and True program. Since 1994, KSDPP has designed and supported community intervention and policy initiatives to increase healthy behaviour and environments to reduce type 2 diabetes.

Problem: Despite this, KSDPP encounters significant barriers in impacting every sector of Kahnawake. These barriers are best understood and addressed through an Indigenous lens on how individuals and organisations collaborate and exchange knowledge and resources.

Research Questions and Objectives: 1) What does community interpersonal and inter-organisational collaboration for policy and program implementation look like? and 2) how does collaboration within organisations between impact ability to effectively collaborate with other community organisations?

Methods: With full community collaboration, this project uses social network analysis to understanding interpersonal, inter- and intra-organisational collaboration, with a focus on mapping knowledge and resource-sharing networks. It uses outcome measures identified as significant factors in effective inter-organisational policy implementation. Evaluation will assess implementation reach and uptake using current data as baseline.

Impacts: This project will scale up KSDPP's initiatives to reach underserved sectors of Kahnawake; while creating and testing an Indigenous Knowledge Translation Framework for use in other settings."

We want to support community-based knowledge exchange events that bring science back to community members in accessible ways. We have proposed a series of monthly ""Snack Chat"" events around the Vancouver area within community-based organizations in order to share new research with diverse communities of people living with and/or impacted by HIV. The research areas and topics at the Snack Chat sessions will reflect the identified needs of community but will primarily focus on HIV, Hepatitis C, substance use, mental health, and/or health care utilization. Peers (community members living with HIV) will be involved in the ""Snack Chat"" events as leaders and facilitators along with researchers who will volunteer to share their research in accessible, engaging ways. Finding inclusive and informal ways to encourage ongoing dialogue between researchers and community members is an important part of community-based research. Our team's has a long history of community-based research and we have established strong partnerships with scientists and researchers as well as local community organizations serving PLHIV, including the Dr. Peter Centre (DPC) and Positive Living BC (PLBC). The activities proposed in this grant will expand the reach of HIV health research findings by making them relevant and accessible for PLHIV through low barrier, community-based events. This is a model for knowledge dissemination that could be adapted to fit various settings across Canada in order to better support responsible and reciprocal research processes."

In this study I will map cases of syphilis in BC in order to see the distribution of cases across different phases (or ""waves"") of the syphilis epidemic. I will pay special attention to people who are also HIV-infected and those who have more than one syphilis infection across multiple years. I will find clusters of infection using specialized statistical software and will determine whether those clusters are outbreaks lasting a short period of time or ongoing clusters which may be important to the continuation of the syphilis epidemic. Lastly, I will use Canadian Census data to look at social and economic factors in the neighbourhoods where clusters are occurring.

This research will improve public health in several ways. By finding ongoing clusters of syphilis (and HIV) infection, we may have a better idea of how to geographically target syphilis testing, treatment, and other sexually transmitted infection prevention and control programs. By describing the cases (e.g., age, sexual behaviours, social/economic conditions) at various stages of the epidemic, we may learn how best to tailor interventions. Finally, through comparison of the BC epidemic with those of other jurisdictions, we may find common patterns in the spread of the disease and thus help to better control syphilis around the world."

More specifically, we endeavor to focus and work to address the following areas with the continued CIHR support as IGW Phase Three grantee: 

1. We are committed to advancement of health research broadly (beyond our lab) to meaningfully include Two-Spirit individuals and communities by collecting and analyzing data in a culturally safe and affirming way. This will in turn ensure that health researchers promote rigorous science that considers all sexes and genders, inclusive of Indigenous identities and roles. 

2. We will explore and develop best and wise practices of decolonizing research by centering Indigenous and Two-Spirit ways of being and by using Mi'kmaq Elder Albert Marshall's Two-Eyed seeing approach.

3. Learning from our existing community partners/relationships, the 2SDL will expand and grow those partnerships/relationships with attention to do community engaged research with gender-inclusive (women, non-binary, trans and cisgender) networks, where the 2SDL work will be informed, directed and guided by our community partners/relationships.

4. And finally, we will continue to build and bridge the capacity of Indigenous and settler-ally scholars, learners, and community health leaders to conduct Two-Spirit-informed research, by establishing a larger team of Indigenous Two-Spirit Peer Researchers."

Conversion therapies continue in Canada today, despite that doctors and psychologists have said these practices are unethical and harmful. Conversion therapy survivors have begun to speak out and demand government action at all levels (federal, provincial, municipal) to stop these harmful practices. In 2019, the Canadian federal government, BC provincial government, and numerous municipal governments have introduced legislation to ban conversion therapy. We do not have current Canadian research to help us understand whether these bans will work, or what else is needed to support conversion therapy survivors.

This research project will allow for a team of researchers, healthcare providers, conversion therapy survivors, and community leaders to plan and share urgently needed national research on conversion therapy, in order to identify policy options for ending conversion therapy and improving supports for survivors. Specifically, we will: 1) gather international data to describe how many people are exposed to conversion therapy and what are the health effects of being exposed; 2) meet as a team-including conversion therapy survivors of diverse genders and sexual orientations; and 3) prepare research grants to conduct interviews and surveys with conversion therapy survivors across Canada. Our goal is to create current, local, and detailed information about where, when, by whom, and to whom conversion therapies are practiced."

The COVID-19 pandemic has unfortunately revealed a concerning trend, with a gap in trust between many Indigenous communities and public health authorities.

Kloshe Tillicum means ""good relations"" in Chinook Jargon. The rapid research we propose builds on longstanding relations between our team-the BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC)'s Chee Mamuk program-and numerous Indigenous communities through BC, as well as a provincial survey examining misinformation related to COVID-19 (N=3,073 respondents, April 2020). In conversation with First Nations partners of Chee Mamuk, we have heard members of some communities express confusion over discrepancies in COVID-19-related messages they receive from different levels of government and different sources (media, social media, word-of-mouth, public health, etc.). Meanwhile, other communities have told of missed opportunities for meaningful Indigenous community involvement in public health-directed contact tracing efforts.

This rapid knowledge synthesis, working with Indigenous communities throughout BC and the BCCDC, will assess community-led strategies to build trust with regard to the following COVID-19 related activities: testing, contact tracing, social/physical distancing, and vaccination. We will meet this objective through Indigenous and community-led methodologies that have been established and used by our team for many years. Through activities-based focus groups, we will identify culturally meaningful ways to engage communities in COVID-19 prevention measures."

The association of Zika virus infection with microcephaly and other neurological disorders led the WHO to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern in Feb 2016. Significant knowledge gaps remain in understanding factors that affect Zika virus spread at the interface of humans, mosquitoes, and their environments (ecological transmission dynamics) and the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of interventions.

Our objective is to characterize the ecological transmission dynamics of Zika virus and design integrated Zika virus intervention strategies. We have two specific aims: 
1. To describe Zika virus vector populations (mosquitoes), viral genetic diversity and ecological transmission dynamics in three different settings in LAC, and predict areas at risk for Zika virus transmission across the LAC region, and 
2. To identify a range of Zika virus intervention strategies (e.g., mosquito control, vaccine) and assess their predicted effectiveness, economic impact and cost-effectiveness using computer simulation.

We have developed multidisciplinary and international collaborations to conduct field studies in Argentina, Colombia and Ecuador to characterize the ecological transmission dynamics of Zika virus and predict areas at risk in each country and across the LAC region. We will design and assess integrated Zika virus intervention strategies using computer simulation based on the data collected in the field studies and other data (from collaborators and the literature). 
Zika virus presents a unique and urgent challenge that compels a multidisciplinary response. Our research will address critical research priorities identified by PAHO/WHO, including assessing mosquito control measures; providing decision-makers with a tool to rapidly determine optimal intervention strategies."
Access to care and the economic burden of tuberculosis in Ontario during the COVID-19 pandemic: illuminating inequities to support public health policy,"['Sander, Beate H', 'Rea, Elizabeth H']","['Brode, Sarah K', 'Daftary, Amrita', ""O'Brien, Kelly K"", 'Pease, Christopher', 'Ramsay, Lauren']","['Access To Care', 'Covid-19', 'Economic Burden', 'Equity', 'Public Health', 'Tuberculosis']",99939.0,460451,"Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, tuberculosis (TB) was the world's leading infectious disease killer. TB remains a substantial health burden in Ontario, with over 600 annual cases reported. Not only are marginalized populations the most likely to be infected with TB, the economic burden of TB is also likely to be more severe due to socioeconomic status and labour market roles. TB care and burden has changed during the COVID-19 pandemic; COVID-19 restrictions have presented a risk of delayed TB diagnosis and treatment. These delays facilitate transmission of TB in the community and may increase the health and economic burden of TB. In Ontario, we do not yet have a good understanding of how access to TB care has been impacted by COVID-19 from the patient perspective, or the economic burden of TB, specifically as it relates to equity relevant characteristics.

Our overall goal is to describe the TB patient experience during COVID-19 and to characterize the societal and health system costs of TB in Ontario, with a focus on equity. We will conduct patient interviews and administer patient cost-questionnaires to adults currently in treatment for TB disease and conduct a health system cost analysis using health administrative data and expert interviews. In all three studies we will apply an equity framework (Cochran's PROGRESS) to illuminate inequities in health opportunities and outcomes across relevant variables (e.g., sex/gender, race/ethnicity/culture). 

TB during the COVID-19 pandemic presents an important priority area for policy making as an opportunity to expand COVID-19 public health measures and government programs (e.g., CERB) to TB patients who would benefit greatly. Our work will provide timely and high-quality evidence on the healthcare and societal economic burden of TB as well as inequities in access to care to equip decision-makers with the information they need to plan and implement policies to best support adults with TB disease."

The Tl'etinqox and Qwelminte SecwÃ©pemc continue to respond to current climate change issues (wildfires, floods, landslides, and the resulting displacement of Indigenous community members from neighbouring Nations). However, the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated restrictions have exacerbated the impacts of climate change issues on the health and well-being of Indigenous peoples in these two cultural groups. By using Indigenous research methodologies (IRM) with a strengths-based approach, the proposed research aims to understand (1) the complex interplay between climate change, the COVID-19 pandemic, gender and intersectional perspectives, and health; (2) how this complexity has impacted Indigenous peoples' response to climate change refugees or evacuees; and (3) what sustainable community-led solutions might be suitable for the current and future pandemics and health emergencies.

A knowledge translation study to identify the best practices for disseminating parent education about drowning prevention in children,"['Sandomierski, Megan C']",['N/A'],"['Child Safety', 'Child-Injury Prevention', 'Dissemination', 'Drowning Prevention', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Parent Supervision']",105000.0,229653,"In Canada, as in many nations, drowning is a leading cause of death and disability for children. Worldwide, drowning has resulted in a higher rate of mortality than any other cause of injury in children under the age of 15, with the highest drowning mortality rates being in children under the age of five. In Canada, drowning is a threat to children both inside and outside the home. 

While teaching children how to swim is one approach to drowning prevention, research has consistently supported the protective function of close parent supervision as well. However, a false sense of security can occur among parents as their children accumulate swim lessons (i.e., parents believe that their child needs less direct supervision around water when they spend more time in lessons).  Therefore, finding the most effective ways to reach parents to educate them about young children's drowning risk and the need for close supervision is very important.

The proposed research project will identify the best strategies for delivering parent education information about drowning and supervision in cost-effective ways. Online education tools and an educational video for parents to watch at the same time that their child is in swim lessons may be effective strategies. Extensive discussion and consultation will be done with parents as well as swim lesson organizations to identify specific strategies to test and how best to implement these. Excellent relationships have already been established with the swim organizations and we are presently in collaboration with them on another research project. Community-based testing of the strategies that are identified will take place in the swim organizations, and results will then be used to direct planning about how to make information available to parents. Results of this research will help to reduce the burden of drowning risk among young Canadian children."
"Poverty, emotion development, and brain development: The effects of a poverty reduction intervention on early childhood development","['Sandre, Aislinn K']",['N/A'],"['Children', 'Depression', 'Development', 'Electroencephalography (Eeg)', 'Emotion', 'Family Income', 'Frontal Alpha Asymmetry', 'Infants', 'Mental Health', 'Poverty']",150000.0,473643,"Poverty affects 1.3 million children in Canada and is especially harmful to a child's health and development during the first few years of life. Growing up in poverty places children at high risk for developing depression, possibly by shaping the function of brain areas that support emotional development. For these reasons, we need to intervene early to prevent depression and invest in anti-poverty policies to promote the mental health and brain function of poor children. Unfortunately, the development of effective preventions for depression and investment in tax-free child benefits have been slow, in part because we do not know if income is related to brain function that supports emotional development and mental health in young children, and if poverty reduction causes changes to this brain function. To address these gaps, my research will test if family income is related to emotional brain activity in infants, and if a poverty reduction intervention causes changes to emotional brain activity in children from low-income families. First, I will test if lower family income is related to poorer emotional brain activity in 200 infants. In a second study, 1000 low-income mothers received either a high-cash monthly gift ($333) to boost their family income or a low-cash monthly gift ($20) for the first four years of their children's lives. I will test if children whose mothers received the high-cash gift show healthier emotional brain activity than children whose mothers received the low-cash gift. Combined, my research will help us understand the link between poverty and emotional brain activity in infants and young children. It will also show if we can promote healthier emotional brain activity by increasing family income. Ultimately, my findings will inform more effective early preventions for depression and will provide Canadian policymakers with strong evidence of the likely benefits of income-support policies on children's brain development and mental health."
Creation of a profile of driving comfort for older drivers,"['Sangrar, Ruheena']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,368322,"Background: Health-related issues due to aging and medical conditions have been linked to unsafe driving habits in older adulthood. Drivers aged 70 and older are at a higher risk of being involved in at-fault collisions. However, driving is the most common way older adults get to the places they need to go. Being able to drive is important to their participation in activities outside of their home. Losing the ability to drive can impact overall health, quality of life, and social engagement. These impacts can also cause stress in family, friends, and health providers. Older drivers also experience changes in their comfort and confidence while driving.  Losing the ability to drive or being involved in a preventable collision can have major health and social implications for older Canadians. Methods: The Canadian Driving Research Initiative for Vehicular Safety in the Elderly (Candrive) study tracked the health and driving behaviours of 928 Canadians aged 70 years and older for six years. Data from Candrive was analyzed to investigate linkages between age, gender and other characteristics with how far and often older people drive and their comfort level behind-the-wheel in various driving situations. Implications: This analysis provides one of the most in-depth and up-to-date profiles of older male and female drivers in Canada. From this presentation, researchers and clinicians will have a better understanding of how driving comfort changes in later life, and which demographic characteristics might predict such changes. Key information will be used to inform a driver retraining intervention that aims to keep older adults driving for as long as they are safe to do so.  Given Canada's aging population, results from this study set the stage for implementing a unique approach to reducing preventable collisions and testing its effectiveness as part of initiatives that keep older drivers and others safe on our roadways."
The Role of time perspective in understanding and predicting smoking behaviour: Findings from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Surveys,"['Sansone, Genevieve C']",['N/A'],"['Cessation', 'Culture', 'Health Behaviour', 'Personality', 'Policy Impact', 'Psychosocial Moderators', 'Survey Analysis', 'Tobacco']",105000.0,229654,"Smoking remains the leading preventable cause of mortality in the world today, thus more research is needed to understand why people engage in behaviours such as smoking that are so harmful to their health. This is one of the goals of the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Project, the first major study to evaluate the impact of tobacco control policies worldwide by conducting parallel prospective surveys in 20 countries. In my doctoral research, I am using ITC data to investigate the role of psychological factors in explaining how and why a given policy may lead to changes in smoking behaviour. Specifically, one factor that I have examined as an important predictor of smoking-related behaviour is time perspective - the extent to which individuals think their current actions have future consequences. In an analysis of ITC data from five countries where both smokers and non-smokers were surveyed, I found that smokers were significantly less likely to hold a future time perspective than non-smokers. In a follow-up study, I found that stronger future time perspective among the smokers in this sample was positively associated with having a stronger orientation towards quitting. In future analyses, the longitudinal nature of the ITC surveys will enable further investigation into the predictive ability of this trait on actual quitting behaviour. I am also examining the influence of time perspective as a moderator of policy interventions designed to reduce tobacco use, such as the enhancement of warning labels on cigarette packages. Overall, the proposed research will provide insight into how tobacco control policies influence behaviour by improving our understanding of the role of personality constructs in explaining smoking uptake and cessation. This knowledge will be valuable to both researchers and policymakers in the field of tobacco control in their ongoing efforts to reduce the toll of tobacco use in Canada and across the world."

It is critical for researchers to produce evidence that supports effective tobacco control efforts, especially in developing nations where the tobacco epidemic is now shifting. The International Tobacco Control (ITC) Project was created in response to this urgent need to rigorously evaluate tobacco control policies. ITC conducts large-scale longitudinal cohort surveys of tobacco users in 20 countries. I plan to use ITC data not only to evaluate policies but also to determine the psychosocial moderators of policy impact, particularly the role of emotions in smoking behavior and cessation. One very important emotion is regret, which was found to be a near-universal feeling among smokers in high-income countries (Fong et al, 2004). In my research with developing countries I found that regret is higher in societies with stronger tobacco control and more negative social norms against smoking. I plan to extend this research to determine if regret also predicts quitting, which would have important implications for smoking cessation programs. I also plan to examine the role of emotions as mediators of policy impact by working with the ITC-Brazil project. Brazil has released a ground-breaking, disturbing set of graphic warning label images on their cigarette packs, which were designed to be highly negative and arousing. I will test whether these warnings are effective in arousing negative emotions, and if these emotions become linked to cigarettes so that smokers with stronger emotional reactions become more likely to quit smoking. This would suggest that Canada and other nations should also incorporate emotions into their warning labels to induce stronger aversions towards smoking. This research will contribute to the evidence base for effective tobacco control policies that will reduce the global burden of tobacco use."

There is preliminary evidence that FM has a severe negative impact on women's sexual lives, sexual relationships, and sexual well-being. The proposed research will be comprised of three studies. The first study will determine the nature and extent of compromised sexual well-being in patients with FM compared to individuals who are not living with a pain disorder. Although research has begun to identify the impact of FM on individuals' sexual lives, little is known about their experiences or about why and how FM negatively affects sexual well-being. Therefore, a second goal of this study is to test a model delineating the illness-related mechanisms underlying the relationship between FM and lower sexual well-being. In the second study, the main goal is to test the reciprocal effects of examine the reciprocal effects of individuals with FM and their partner on both partners' sexual well-being by collecting data from both members of the couple. The results of these innovative studies will be used for the third study in which a detailed informational pamphlet will be designed as an intervention to improve sexual well-being for patients with FM and their partner. Thus, the fourth goal of the research proposal is to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention. The proposed research will offer the first evidence of why FM affects sexual well-being and preliminary evidence of how to promote sexual well-being in individuals with FM."

Early palliative care is about offering palliative care shortly after a diagnosis of advanced cancer. People at the bottom of the social hierarchy tend to experience significantly more health problems than those at the top. They may also face serious challenges in many areas such as income, education, social status, employment, and housing, among others. In Canada, they tend to die younger than other Canadians. Those with a cancer diagnosis tend to be diagnosed at an advanced stage and may experience complex cancer pain and other problems. Palliative care improves the wellbeing of people with serious illnesses such as advanced cancer. Palliative care helps with symptom relief and quality of life. We will organize meetings with nurses, oncologists, palliative care doctors, and other team members. We will ask them for their views concerning the need for early palliative care for those who have little in society. We will invite them to suggest particular groups that are vulnerable from a socioeconomic point of view. We will also ask them for ideas to facilitate access to palliative care for these groups. In addition, we will study how income may influence access to palliative care based on clinical data available from the past. This information will help us prepare a new study to create and implement a palliative care intervention for these groups. We will also approach health and government authorities to request their support. Our work will be based in Edmonton. We may also involve another major Canadian city and also collaborate with health care providers in Brazil to learn from their experiences. This work will assist us to support people living in difficult socioeconomic circumstances to find needed relief during a difficult time of their lives."

While mental illness and substance use problems (MISUP) in Latin America account for approximately a tenth of the world's total burden of the disease, very few individuals receive adequate treatment. 18 million Latin Americans are reported to be facing unemployment, eviction, and homelessness as a result of mental disorders. Untreated MISUP are a major public health issue as they can lead to long-term disability, impaired functioning, caregiver burden, and ultimately premature death. Given the prevalence of such issues in Latin America, an effort to address health equity and accessibility to mental health services is warranted.

Research regarding mental health service use in Latin America is scarce, with even fewer studies focusing on barriers to accessibility such as stigma and discrimination. The goal for this project is to share key insights among Latin American countries to better understand factors that inhibit access to mental health services. Funding for a 3-day meeting bringing together key stakeholders from Chile, Canada, Peru, Bolivia and Argentina who are actively addressing these issues will serve three objectives:

1. Dissemination of Research - Disseminating findings from anti-stigma projects in Chile, Peru and Canada detailing challenges within their health systems, impact of interventions and opportunities to further research in this area. 

2. Information Gathering - Exploring research studies concerning factors that prevent access to mental health care in Bolivia and Argentina to extract key insights from each approach.

3. Collaboration - Developing new, relevant and collaborative regional projects, research and interventions addressing accessibility to mental health services."

Over 70% of Canadians are exposed to traumatic events (e.g., physical injury, assault) in their lives. Although most are resilient, a substantial minority experience subsequent emotional problems.The diagnosis of PTSD may be given when a group of symptoms, such as disturbing flashbacks, avoidance of situations or memories associated with the event, hyperarousal, and changes in cognitions continue for more than a month after the traumatic event. Much knowledge about PTSD has come from non-Canadian samples, is inconsistent, and is based on cross-sectional studies that preclude causal inferences.Major gaps exist in the literature on the incidence, longitudinal course, impact, and treatment needs of PTSD in Canadians. It is essential to understand the trajectory of PTSD within Canadaâs unique demographic, sociocultural and health care system influences.Research Objectives:1) Define the incidence and longitudinal course of PTSD in Canadian samples.2) Develop prediction tools to identify those at risk for incident and persistent PTSD.3) Define the impact of PTSD on subsequent risk for negative health outcomes (e.g., disability, addictions, physical or mental health problems, and mortality).4) Describe health care use and treatment needs among people with PTSD.Two cohorts will provide complementary information on the longitudinal consequences of trauma and PTSD among vulnerable groups.Cohort I. Civilians with Acute Trauma Exposure at High Risk for PTSD.We will recruit a representative sample of 1000 participants presenting to acute care settings for physical injuries, sexual assault, or with serious physical illness.

Longitudinal Mental Health Survey of Active Military Personnel and Veterans.Combat and peacekeeping-related PTSD is an important public health issue in active Canadian military and veterans. In 2002, Statistics Canada and the Canadian Forces conducted the first nationally-representative mental health survey. In collaboration with key stakeholders, we plan to conduct a 14-year follow-up of these participants (n~4500) to examine longitudinal exposure to stress and subsequent health outcomes.Expertise.

Citizen Science Approaches in Mosquito Surveillance: Strengthening Capacity of Public Health and Climate Change Adaptation,"['Sarkar, Atanu', 'Pons, Wendy']",['N/A'],"['Citizen Science', 'Climate Change', 'Mosquito-Borne Diseases']",124500.0,485340,"This project aims to be a foundation to facilitate community-based scientific research and promote greater public engagement in science while also providing opportunities for community members to gain new skills and knowledge in the scientific field. The objectives of the project are; to conduct a knowledge synthesis on different methods of citizen science approaches to mosquito surveillance for control of mosquito-borne diseases, its validity and sustainability, and the impacts of these methods in population health; to develop an adaptable toolkit for use across Canada that would provide key considerations and best practices for communities looking to implement a citizen science initiative for mosquito-borne disease surveillance. We will conduct a systematic review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. This process will begin with defining the scope of our search, identifying key terms, and carrying out an extensive search of electronic databases, such as (but not limited to) Pubmed, social sciences abstracts, sociological abstracts, social sciences citation index, Scopus, Cochrane database of systematic reviews, and google scholar. We will also perform targeted searches for grey literature, including Google, and relevant discipline-based list serves and will use ProQuest to locate graduate (masters and Ph.D.) theses on relevant topics. We aim to create a toolkit that outlines best practices and steps for designing a citizen science mosquito project that could be carried out across Canada. The toolkit would be used by organizations considering enhancing their traditional mosquito surveillance program by developing a citizen science approach to mosquito surveillance in Canada. This toolkit would be developed based on a) contributions from an Expert Advisory Group (EAG) and b) data gathered from objective A- knowledge synthesis."

It combines the strengths of CIETcanada as a training and service delivery organization, and PRAM in McGill's Department of Family Medicine.
The project will apply participatory research methods developed by CIETcanada to a study of the effects on mothers' health of supporting indigenous traditional midwives in their work and in their interaction with the official health system in Guerrero state, Mexico. During the fellowship, the doctoral trainee will increase his skills and experience in three areas in particular: studying and evaluating health programs; communicating research findings to those who need to use them; and stimulating change in the provision of services. 
The trainee will be supervised by Dr Anne Cockcroft in CIETcanada, whose work studies people's access to and experience of health services, and uses findings to plan improvements, and by Dr Neil Andersson in McGill Family Medicine, an international leader in participatory research methods and in culturally-respectful work with indigenous communities. The trainee will study the effects on mothers' health of the program of support for traditional midwives in Mexico; collect and examine stories from the  traditional midwives of their experience in the program; help the traditional midwives to map out their knowledge about causes of mothers' health problems and analyse these maps; and create a working guide for using participatory, culturally safe approaches to work in different cultural settings. The trainee will publish the research results and discuss them with communities in Mexico to design together actions to improve their situation. 
The proposed fellowship will improve the understanding of researchers and service providers working with indigenous populations about culturally safe approaches and intercultural dialogue."

The Association of Indigenous Communities of the Yapu River (ASATRIZY) called us (a group of Western academics) to collaborate to respond together to this challenge trough the novel approach of Intercultural Dialogue. This approach proposes an interchange between two epistemologies in the process of building knowledge. At the same time that we offered our concepts and methodologies, the indigenous counterpart offered theirs. It is a process of mutual learning where both sides are nourished by the contact with the other, and new knowledge arises. Our first learning was that health had a broader implication than the absence of illness, it involves the life as a whole, then Nature and land can also be sick because the practices necessary to maintain the balance are gone as ancestral traditions are forgotten. Finally, people's health is affected by a negative feedback loop. A weak relation between land and culture is a source of illnesses. The way to reestablish the balance is the fulfillment of ancestral rules in two levels: the personal and the communal; this rules are defined in the myths of these groups and are often expressed in ritual contexts. ASATRIZY has developed its government and proposed a scholar system to teach this framework to their children and thus foster the good life in their land."

We will train future peer health advocates in traditional birthing methods implemented in their communities and an urban hub. Our team works with child protection workers of pregnant clients to disrupt processes and provide interventions in child welfare practices that help prevent and alleviate infant apprehensions and anxieties. Using a collaborative approach with partner First Nations communities and frontline Indigenous organizations promotes interventions that support the recovery and renewal of cultural and ceremonial traditions associated with pregnancy, childbirth and parenthood, infant and breastfeeding care, and rites of passage. It will serve to remind families and communities who have not had traditional birthing cycles for a generation or more of the protective and healing elements that occur when the traditional birthing cycle is restored. 
A multidisciplinary research team will reconcile western and traditional approaches to childbirth and train Indigenous women with childbirth experience to serve as peer health advocates in their communities. As role models, PLHIV are practitioners of traditional childbirth practices and rites of passage which help childbirth participants integrate these protective supports into their daily lives. 
Finally, each participant will be offered an Okawimaw Kanosimowin for their participation. In addition to sacred, traditional, medicinal and practical childbirth aids, the kit will include cultural items, health information and resources, a food mill, and essential postpartum help and materials."

Children and teens who are physically active reap benefits for physical, mental and social health, yet up to 75% of youth drop out of sport and physical activity during their teenage years. Girls are affected by this decline more than boys. The shift from elementary to secondary school is a critical time of change, and many factors at home (i.e., parental support, co-participation), school (i.e., access to physical education, sports teams), and with peers influence these behaviour changes. To better understand how these factors influence changes in physical activity and sport as youth move into secondary school, this study will survey and interview youth in grades 7 and 8, and their parents to capture their insights and experiences during this critical developmental time."

There is little data currently available on the extent of the situation in the Laurentians (Quebec, Canada). The purpose of this study is to identify the best North American interventions, facilitators and barriers, as well as to understand the opioid crisis in the Laurentians region.

A mixed-method design was developed by combining a literature review of systematic reviews and semi-structured interviews with stakeholders in the Laurentians.

The nine systematic reviews revealed five categories of intervention:  Those targeting opioid prescriptions, naloxone distribution, the use of psychosocial intervention in combination with opioid substitution therapy, medical cannabis in pain management and functional magnetic resonance imaging to study opioid use disorders. 

Naloxone distribution programs showed good evidence of effectiveness, but studies for other types of programs showed weak to no impact on the opioids-related harms. Four Laurentian stakeholders were interviewed: a public health officer, a PWUD, a community health physician and a community pharmacist. They presented their perspective according to five themes: the state of the situation in the Laurentians, the cause of the epidemic, the people at risk and the response to the crisis in the region, as well as future prospects.

This study brings a new perspective on what is currently being done to address the opioid crisis in North America and how this knowledge can be applied to the opioid crisis in the Laurentians region and possibly in other Canadian regions."

To conduct environmental monitoring research and inform policy in ways that are centered on Inuit values and priorities, understanding the intrinsic, interconnected relationships Inuit hold with the land is essential.
The goal of this research is to characterize environment and health metrics of value to Inuit Rigolet, Nunatsiavut, Labrador. In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted with Inuit in Rigolet and government members in Happy Valley-Goose Bay to identify important environment and health metrics, and explore why these metrics should be monitored. Focus group discussions were conducted with local and regional government members to discuss how monitoring these metrics can inform health policy in Nunatsiavut. 
Collaboratively developing values-based metrics helped articulate tangible and intangible Inuit health priorities. Analyses indicated that monitoring environmental changes is valuable for: promoting safety; generating and sharing knowledge; strengthening reciprocal relationships between Inuit and the land; and inspiring environmental advocacy efforts in the North.
This research demonstrates the importance of developing environment and health metrics rooted in Inuit values and ways of knowing for sustainable monitoring strategies in the North that enhance Inuit wellbeing."

These challenges are especially prominent among Inuit populations, who must deal with climate change impacts in addition to repercussions of colonization and loss of traditional cultures. As Inuit are intrinsically tied to their environments, climate change affects all dimensions of wellbeing and interacts with other social determinants of health. These ongoing struggles with both past and present challenges create a complex field within which to generate population health interventions that are culturally relevant and sustainable. To respond to these challenges, we are pursuing a participatory approach to develop an environment-health surveillance system in the Inuit community of Rigolet, Nunatsiavut. Building from a strong local research capacity in this community, we will integrate and streamline environment-health data to monitor and respond to current pathways of environmental changes and associated impacts on health. Due to the ways in which current health-related challenges are shaped and perpetuated by historical experiences in this region, it is important to prioritize Inuit perspectives and worldviews when pursuing meaningful environment-health surveillance. As such, we need to understand: local perspectives on environmental change; how these changes are currently dealt with; and what health-related impacts are most important to monitor in this community. Co-development of project design and implementation with Inuit partners will facilitate meaningful engagement of community members and address concerns in a culturally-appropriate manner. Eventually, this participatory approach to surveillance will be used with other Inuit communities in the Circumpolar North, to establish population health interventions that empower communities to improve and sustain good wellbeing in the context of climate change."

Toward building children's exposome: integrating inhalation exposures for epidemiologic studies of childhood asthma,"['Sbihi, Hind']",['N/A'],"['Air Pollution', 'Asthma', 'Children Health', 'Cohort Studies', 'Environmental Exposure Assessment', 'Exposome']",105000.0,229546,"The prevalence of childhood asthma has increased dramatically over recent decades. Asthma is a complex disease which depends on genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors. Environmental factors are likely to be important in explaining the increasing trend in asthma prevalence. Air pollution is well-known to exacerbate existing asthma but its role in the development of asthma is less clear. Research has shown that the development of childhood asthma is complex and may be related to both outdoor (e.g. traffic pollution) and indoor (e.g. allergens and endotoxins) air pollution. Combining these known and suspected air pollution sources is a much needed and key step in understanding the role of air pollution in the development of childhood asthma. 
The aim of the proposed study is to develop a measure of all exposures coming into contact with the human body via the respiratory route. Incorporating both outdoor and indoor sources will fill the gap for future studies of childhood asthma. We will be using the Canadian Health Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) study. CHILD is a population-based birth-cohort national study of 5,000 children that collects information on environmental exposures over a five year period in four cities (Edmonton, Winnipeg, Vancouver and Toronto). We will be linking outdoor air pollution exposure concentrations, measured indoor pollutants, and housing characteristics to define children exposome which is the dynamic mapping of life-course environmental exposures from the prenatal period onwards.  
The exposure model will then be used to predict the risk of the development of childhood onset asthma. This risk assessment tool adds important information and has potential policy implications for managing the unrelenting increase of asthma."

Yet, even small babies can have serious lung diseases, like asthma which is a life-long problem. In fact, asthma is the most common long-term illness that starts in very early life. In asthma, the breathing passages becomes red, swollen and ""twitchy"" so they sometimes go into spasm, making it very hard to breathe. Asthma has no cure. Even if they feel fine, people with asthma still have the disease and it can flare up at any time. In Canada, asthma is the most common and burdensome chronic non-communicable disease affecting young Canadians. This is a segment of the population deserving special attention given their age, vulnerability and the burden at the societal and economic level: 1-in-3 Canadians will be diagnosed with asthma in their lifetime. It isn't clear why only some people get asthma, but we think it is probably due to a combination of environmental and inherited (genetic) factors.
The goal of the proposed research is to understand environmental and genetic factors that cause asthma in children.
We will use samples and data from a large Canadian study, where the mothers and babies were assessed in pregnancy, at birth, and up to age 5 years. We will determine effects of  carefully-chosen environmental factors predicted to be related to asthma: traffic pollution, neighboring green spaces, and types of bacteria living in our intestines. Early life is a critical period to shape the later life health, especially through epigenetics mechanism: changes in the function of our genes in relation to environmental influences provide a basis to explain how and why asthma and allergies exist and progress. 

We hope to gain new understanding to create better tools to predict who will get asthma and find ways to prevent asthma from developing in the first place."

VoCs threaten the public health gains obtained via various control measures and may even boost a new trajectory for the pandemic and worsen health inequities. There is early evidence suggesting that these variants may also have deleterious clinical impacts by increasing the disease severity, but these studies used surveillance data alone, and were challenged by potential biases such as the inability to account for factors like chronic health conditions that could act as confounders, and different time periods of comparison - most studies compared severity from VoCs now with cases from a few months ago.
Therefore there is urgency in fully understanding the extent of their virulence with population based approaches that can limit these biases.
To this end, we propose to use genomic and population-level clinical data on all cases of COVID-19 in two provinces where VoCs were first detected, British Columbia and Ontario, and to fully investigate each of the circulating variant, namely B.1.1.7, B.1.351 and P.1; as well as the role of specific mutations with severity, such as time to clinical deterioration, hospitalizations, need for intensive care, and mortality. We will then estimate the extent to which VoCs may amplify inequities in health outcomes among the most affected communities, such as those living in congregate settings, essential workers, and multigenerational and dense households. The goal of this collaboration is to leverage extensive scientific and methodological expertise, large population-level data and laboratory diagnostic tests, and thousands of genomic sequences to support efficient and proactive public health and health system response to this ever evolving pathogen."

These disorders run in families and twin studies show that genetic factors are important. Environmental factors, including those relevant to urban environments such as access to green space, social deprivation and air pollution, affect risk for ADHD and OCD. What we currently do not know is how genetic and urban environment factors interact to increase or decrease risk for those disorders on a population level. This information is necessary to inform population-wide policies. Genetics and the environment are usually studied separately because the large-scale data necessary for gene x environment studies has been lacking. Knowing how genes and environment interact is critical to being able to understand what causes these disorders, identify children at risk and inform city planning to maximize mental health in our community. 

To study how genes and urban environmental factors interact to affect ADHD and OCD, we will integrate existing, but currently separate, data sources: Spit for Science and Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research (CANUE) Consortium. The Spit for Science study collected genetic, mental health and Postal Codes from 17,000 children and adolescents. We can use a person's Postal Code to extract information about green space, air pollution, socioeconomic status, social and material deprivation from CANUE. Linking these data sources will allow us to identify gene x urban environment interactions that make children more or less likely to have ADHD and OCD. By conducting this large-scale gene x environment study, we hope to identify specific factors that increase or decrease risk for childhood mental illness, which could potentially lead to changes in urban planning, early detection, better treatments, and improved treatment-outcomes for Canadian youth."

I have led two studies that have laid the groundwork for this upcoming research:

(1) The Cedar Project involved young Indigenous people who use drugs in Canada 
(2) The Cango Lyec Project involved Acholi people in Northern Uganda in the aftermath of the long civil war and widespread child abduction there.

My findings have shown that distress and trauma passed through generations put Indigenous people in both settings at risk of HIV and related infections, other illnesses, and death, as they face tremendous difficulties accessing effective prevention and health care services. This has laid the foundation for the next logical phase of work, namely the development and testing of HIV prevention and treatment programs that build on Indigenous peoples' cultural strengths to promote resiliency and health. This work has been and will be done in full partnership with the respective communities to ensure that the research is relevant and that the findings are implemented.

My research program will lead to the development of high-impact prevention and treatment approaches for those most adversely affected by HIV and other epidemics.

They also experience high levels of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), depression, suicidality, and alcohol and drug use. Researchers increasingly believe that these health problems are inter-related and that they result from the impacts of social exclusion and discrimination, rather than from any condition inherent to being trans. However, research to date has not explored the extent to which these problems are co-occurring in Ontario's diverse trans population, nor the role of social marginalization in producing such outcomes. Therefore, the proposed study will describe the frequency of these health problems and the degree to which they co-occur, and identify the impacts of social exclusion and self-reported discrimination on the risk of multiple, co-occurring problems. It will also identify social, demographic and psychological risk factors for engagement in HIV-related sexual risk behaviour in the past year. The study will use data from the Trans PULSE Project, a community-based research project which surveyed 433 trans Ontarians aged 16 and above in 2009-2010. The project used respondent-driven sampling, an innovative sampling and analysis method for populations that cannot be randomly sampled. Therefore, results will be generalizable to all trans people in Ontario who know at least one other trans person. Results of this research will inform interventions to prevent suicide and problematic substance use, reduce HIV acquisition and transmission, and improve mental health among trans Ontarians. This study also has the potential to provide evidence of the multiple effects of social marginalization on health outcomes, thus informing efforts to increase health equity through interventions at the societal level."

Trans people are known to have higher HIV prevalence than the general population and high vulnerability to HIV infection because of social marginalization, poverty, and lack of access to healthcare. Qualitative research has documented a number of psychosocial issues that trans people face in the areas of body image, sexual satisfaction, and anxieties about sexual activities. These challenges are often unique to the lives of trans people, who struggle with personal and social perceptions of their gendered bodies. Difficulty with finding respectful intimate partners can compound such challenges, leading to a reduced sense of agency when partners are found. These psychosocial factors may limit the ability of trans people to negotiate condom use and/or make them more likely to take sexual risks, thereby increasing the likelihood of HIV transmission. This proposed research will use quantitative data and epidemiological methods to more accurately understand the impact of body image, sexual satisfaction, and sexual anxiety on condom efficacy and sexual risk-taking amongst trans Ontarians. The research will describe the levels of these psychosocial factors amongst trans people and will then determine how these factors impact HIV vulnerability by increasing or decreasing condom efficacy and sexual risk-taking. This research is part of Trans PULSE, a community-based research (CBR) project that surveyed 433 trans people in Ontario in order to gather quantitative data about the health concerns and HIV vulnerability of this marginalized and under-researched community.  As a CBR project, transgender people have been and will be involved in decision-making through all stages of the research process. Furthermore, the research is focused on producing results of practical use for bettering the health of trans communities through HIV prevention interventions."

As IDU is a socially communicable phenomenon, efforts must focus on preventing the involvement of people who currently inject drugs (PWID) in initiating others. As North American PWID disproportionately identify as sexual or gender minorities, and up to one-third are estimated to be female, such interventions must consider how gender and sexuality shape IDU initiation events. Both women as well as sexual and gender minorities (SGM) face structural and interpersonal vulnerabilities that increase their risk of drug-related harms once they begin injecting, but little is known about how this social context contributes to IDU initiation. This project will contribute to preventing IDU initiation among women and SGM by identifying how gender and sexuality shape initiation events, and how gender dynamics impact the effectiveness of health system interventions to reduce the risk that PWID initiate others into IDU. This mixed-methods research will draw on quantitative and qualitative data from Preventing Injecting by Modifying Existing Responses, a five-year multi-site study pooling data from four observational cohorts of people who inject drugs in Canada, the United States, Mexico, and France. Additional original qualitative data will be collected from SGM who inject drugs in the Tijuana-San Diego border region. This study will be the first to examine pathways to IDU for SGM. Employing integrated knowledge translation, this study will move the research field from identifying gender and sexual orientation disparities related to injection drug use towards intervening to reduce them. It will also help to ensure that the prevention benefits of current and emerging injection prevention interventions are fully realized for Canadians of diverse genders and sexualities."

Understanding the Therapeutic Alliance in Young Offender Therapy Through the Experiences of Youth,"['Schiller, Kristen']",['N/A'],"['Therapeutic Alliance', 'Young Offenders']",17500.0,254664,"Therapy within the criminal justice system presents a number of challenges. This is especially true when working with youth, as there is a limited amount of information and research on how to be an effective therapist for this population. Psychotherapeutic research shows that developing a positive relationship between a client and therapist is a strong predictor in the success of therapy. This study will examine how young offenders view their relationship with a researcher in the role of a therapist. The results of this study will provide useful information to improve the development and implementation of young offender treatment programs as well as expand the knowledge and understanding of how to connect with youth during therapy. Mental health professionals will be able to use this information to positively influence the outcome of therapy, thereby reducing the rates of reoffending."

What began as a diagnostic technique in the fields of gynecology, urology and internal medicine in the mid-twentieth century had revolutionized general practice by the beginning of the twenty-first.  Because keyhole methods required a completely different set of skills than traditional 'open' surgery, their introduction into new areas was at first controversial, and took considerable perseverance from both within and beyond the medical profession. We propose to investigate why and how surgeons at first ignored and then learned to use the new techniques, and how they cultivated and spread new skills through personal experience with their peers and colleagues. We will look at the role of technical devices and their manufacturers in shaping the spread of keyhole procedures, and the ways surgeons convinced themselves and the public that the benefits outweighed the risks.  Finally, we will analyze the role of patient demand in accelerating the rise of keyhole surgery. The project focuses on an unexplored revolution in the history of modern surgery, the effects of which are still unraveling.  Its results will therefore provide a better basis for future policy decisions about supporting and guiding technical innovations in surgery and other areas of health care."
Medical Innovation and the Patient Consumer: Explaining the Rise of Minimally Invasive Surgery,"['Schlich, Thomas']","['Tang, Cynthia']","['History Of Surgery', 'History Of Technical Innovation In Medicine', 'Patient History']",413101.0,381357,"In the last thirty years, modern surgery has undergone a major revolution. Open operations have largely been replaced by an alternative: minimally invasive surgery (MIS). In MIS, surgeons insert laparoscopic visualization devices and other miniaturized surgical tools through small incisions to the abdomen. In the late 1980s and early 90s, in the space of less than five years, MIS became the technique of choice among general surgeons in North America and Europe. This rapid uptake has been widely explained as a patient-driven revolution, in which the ""patient consumer"" was a major player. However, we do not know, for instance, how patients actually influenced surgical therapy, especially in countries with predominantly public healthcare systems. 
Focusing on Canada and the USA, our proposed project asks, among other things, how exactly patients put pressure upon surgeons, how they communicate with one another to voice approval or express dissent. Answering these types of questions will help in understanding and defining the role of the patient-consumerism in modern healthcare. 
This history will provide a comparative analysis of patient consumerism at the end of the twentieth century, looking at its various manifestations and its limitations. The proposed project will thus be a major contribution to the still little explored history of MIS as an important and ever-evolving technology in modern surgery, and, more generally, to the history of technological innovation in modern medicine with its technical, scientific, social and cultural aspects. At the same time, it will help understand the changing role of patients in shaping modern medicine and its technologies. Its results will thus provide a better basis for future policy decisions about supporting and guiding technical innovation health care in accordance with the demands of the population."

This instrument measures smoking behaviours and attitudes to monitor the effectiveness of national, provincial and regional tobacco control strategies. This project aims to examine information from current and former youth smokers using individual-level data from the 2008-09 YSS with the goal of understanding some individual, psychosocial, social and environmental factors associated with successful smoking cessation.

Food insecurity has been increasing steadily in Canada. Food insecurity affects people's physical and mental health and social functioning in numerous ways, as it leads to various infectious, chronic and mental illnesses. It is also disproportionately found among racialized people and those with lower social and economic resources. Food insecurity is thus an important consequence and case of poverty, poor health, and social neglect and also an imporant driver of health inequity. Much of neighbourhood-based inequity is discussed to date, such as the concentration of greenspace, crime and income, but geographic injustice of food insecurity is not known, since government surveys collecting food insecurity status cannot provide enough data points to make a statistically reliable neighbourhood (e.g., borough) map. In this project, we create such neighbourhood map of food insecurity using advanced statistical algorithms that make best use of existing datasets about food insecurity. Specifically, the project aims to estimate the proportion of people affected by food insecurity across boroughs in the island of Montreal from 2010 to 2020. The historical trends of borough-level food insecurity in the island of Montreal will, for the first time, highlight likely widening gaps of food insecurity across communities. Such a map will allow municipal governments and researchers to acknowledge neglected inequalities in food insecurity towards social policies and programs enhancing access to healthful and affordable food. The map will also inform public and community members about the presence of food injustice that exacerbated health and social inequalities in Montreal. Thus, this project will serve as an important step for community advocacies towards exploration and removal of structural and historical drivers of food insecurity."
Post-conflict Food Insufficiency and HIV Risk Behaviours Among Women in Northern Uganda,"['Schmidt, Diane']",['N/A'],"['Conflict', 'Displacement', 'Food Insecurity', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Qualitative Analysis', 'Quanitative Analysis', 'Resettlement', 'Risk Behaviour', 'Survival Sex', 'Uganda']",17500.0,226957,"This study will examine the relationship between a lack of food and risk of HIV infection among women in Northern Uganda. 

Vulnerability to HIV/AIDS and food insecurity is of great concern for women living in Northern Uganda where the local population has experienced two decades of violent conflict, causing an unknown number of deaths and human atrocities as well as the displacement of more than 1.6 million people. Lives and lands lost to war, families and cultures decimated, and the collapse of essential infrastructures all contribute to the destruction of livelihoods, and therefore the inability to purchase or produce food.
 
While food insufficiency contributes to many adverse health outcomes, it has also been associated with an increased risk of exposure to the HIV virus, particularly among women living in poverty.  To alleviate hunger, women often exchange sex for money, food or household goods.  With little power to negotiate these sexual relationships, a woman's vulnerability to HIV/AIDS increases.  

Although previous research provides important information on the relationship between food insufficiency and HIV infection, little is known about the magnitude of risk or the mechanisms through which food insufficiency leads women to engage in these risk-taking behaviours. Mechanisms may include a lack of power to manage household resources, limited educational opportunities or systemic discriminatory policies and practices. 

With so many individuals returning to ancestral homes and villages after decades of absence, it is critical to undertake this research now to ensure that HIV/AIDS interventions address the structural, environmental and individual factors that lead to food insufficiency. By addressing these factors, not only can interventions protect women, and consequently children from hunger and hunger-related diseases, they can also reduce a woman's risk of exposure to HIV/AIDS."

According to the Canadian Diabetes Association, approximately 5.7 million Canadians have prediabetes and nearly 50 per cent of those with prediabetes will subsequently develop type 2 diabetes. 
It is likely that mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety and chronic stress play an important role in the transition from prediabetes to diabetes. These conditions might increase the risk of developing type 2 diabetes among individuals with prediabetes through a host of pathways, including engagement in health risk behaviors (smoking, sedentary behavior, unhealthy diet) and  increased body weight.  
There is a lack of research regarding the influence of mental health on the transition from prediabetes to type 2 diabetes. A better understanding of how and when mental health conditions increase the risk of developing diabetes among individuals with prediabetes is needed to design better intervention strategies (e.g., lifestyle interventions that include the management of psychological problems in people with prediabetes) and to reduce the transition rate from prediabetes to diabetes. Therefore, we propose a two day conference to inform and link together researchers, stake holders and policy-makers interested in mental health and prediabetes."

Studies have found a link between neighborhood characteristics and depression, but critical gaps still exist in the literature. For instance, little is known about what specific neighborhood features matter most for depression. The social characteristics (e.g. unemployment rate, population density, age distribution) and physical features of neighborhoods (e.g. access to green spaces and recreational resources) may affect mood differently. It is also unclear for whom this effect is most relevant. Because people with a chronic condition have less mobility and rely more on their local area for services and support, they are likely to be particularly vulnerable to the quality of their neighborhood; yet no research has focused on this population. This project proposes to shed light on these questions. The researchers will use data from participants of a large Canadian health survey followed-up for 14 years (National Population Health Survey). The characteristics of residential neighborhoods will be identified from two sources: Canadian censuses and geographic information systems (GIS). GIS data can provide information such as the number of local parks within a 1km radius for a given address. The researchers will use advanced statistical methods to clarify the way in which neighborhood affects depressive moods in people with and without a chronic. Findings from this work will provide valuable insight into the mechanism by which the neighborhood environment may influence mental health, it will help identify vulnerable groups and precarious residential situations that may benefit from interventions, and will guide policy-makers and urban planners in making neighborhoods happier places to live."

the global burden of disease. Metabolic factors, including obesity, high blood sugar, high blood pressure, high blood levels of
triglycerides, and decreased high-density lipoprotein, are important risk factors for type 2 diabetes. It is likely that these
metabolic factors are associated with depressive symptoms. Understanding the associations between depression, metabolic
abnormalities and behavioral factors might lead to better intervention strategies in ways that would assist in preventing or
delaying type 2 diabetes.
Using a community sample of people aged 40 to 69 years, we plan to evaluate the interaction between depression and metabolic abnormalities on type 2 diabetes incidence.

The two main objectives are a) to identify if psychological problems, social support, diabetes related distress and negative attitudes toward insulin are predictors for change in health status and b)to identify how people manage the initiation of insulin therapy and stay in good health condition.
We propose to conduct a community based cohort study in Quebec with 2,500 insulin naive type 2 diabetes patients at baseline.

We will use different strategies to evaluate change in health status: we will use models where we will study the change of health status over time and we will use models where we will study incidence of poor health status for those with good health status at baseline. 
The proposed study will provide knowledge about psychological problems associated with decline of health status after transition to insulin. This information will allow us to develop tailored interventions to reduce the psychosocial impact of the transition.

The aims of the proposed study are to a) investigate the role of depression subtypes (e.g., atypical depression, melancholic-anxious depression, and major depression without anxiety/atypical symptoms) on the onset of T2D incidence in a Canadian community sample;  and b) evaluate whether including depression subtypes improves predictive value of the previous developed Canadian Diabetes Population Risk Tool (DPoRT). 
We propose to combine survey data (Canadian Community Health Surveys (CCHS) 2002 and 2012 for Ontario residents) with a validated population-based diabetes registry (Ontario Diabetes Database). We will validate our results in a different cohort (CCHS 2002 and 2012 for Quebec residents and administrative data in Quebec (RAMQ)). 
The results might inform the development of strategies for prevention at the individual level (i.e., depression subtypes with the highest risk of T2D) and might have the potential to contribute to the development of tailored treatments for depression, which, in turn, might lead to improved diabetes prevention."

Several studies have established an association between metabolic risk factors and certain types of cancer. There is increasing evidence that depression is associated with the overall occurrence risk of cancer. Depression is also associated with metabolic risk factors, and the co-occurrence of both conditions might increase the risk of developing cancer. 

The primary objective of the proposed study is to investigate the associations between metabolic dysregulation, depression and incidence of cancer (subtypes). Secondary objectives are to a) evaluate the role of depression severity on the associations between metabolic dysregulation and cancer (subtypes); and b) investigate potential moderating effects of sex, socioeconomic status, and lifestyle behaviors on the association between depression, metabolic dysregulation, and incidence of cancer (subtypes); and c) to evaluate potential mediating effects of change in lifestyle behaviors (physical inactivity, smoking, poor diet, and sleep problems) on the association between metabolic dysregulation,  depression and cancer incidence.

This proposed project is a follow-up assessment of 38,600 individuals without cancer who participated in the CARTaGENE study in Quebec, Canada. Participants were recruited from administrative databases (RÃ©gie de l'Assurance Maladie du QuÃ©bec, provincial public health insurer in Quebec) and these databases will be used for the assessment of our outcome measure (incidence of cancer).
A greater understanding of the interactions between depression and metabolic risk factors can ultimately lead to increased accuracy in identifying groups at high risk of cancer and thus better inform preventative care. Moreover, elucidating the mechanisms through which depression and metabolic risk factors increase the risk of developing cancer suggests targets for intervention."

Family history of T2D is one of the major risk factors for T2D.

Familial aggregation studies estimate that genetic variants explain less than 10% of the disease's heritability, suggesting that that a substantial proportion of the remaining heritability comes from shared behaviours and shared environmental factors.

Parental depression might play an important role in the intergenerational transmission of T2D. The combination of parental T2D with parental depression might increase the risk of T2D in offspring. 

Stress resilience, the ability to adapt successfully to stress and adversity and flourishing (social, emotional, physical and psychological well-being) might decrease the risk of T2D onset in individuals with parental T2D/depression history.

Using a two-generation sample of adults without T2D and their parents, the main objectives are to identify a) if the combination of parental T2D and parental depression history increases the risk of T2D in their offspring; b) if parental T2D and parental depression increase the risk of depression and chronic stress in offspring, which, in turn, increases the risk of T2D in offspring;  c) if high stress resilience in offspring of parents with T2D/depression decreases the risk of developing T2D; and d) if flourishing in offspring of parents with T2D/depression decreases the risk of developing T2D. 

We propose to recruit 9,000 participants without T2D aged 40 years and older and their parents from the Lifelines Cohort Study in the Netherlands. Incidence of T2D will be assessed at two additional bi-annual follow-up assessment.

The Lifelines study offers a unique opportunity to study the role of parental depression in the intergenerational transmission of T2D due to its large sample size (167,729 participants), its open protocol and its intergenerational design.

Applying a systems-based Ecohealth approach to study the burden of infection from Leptospirosis in Trinidad,"['Schneider, Evan']",['N/A'],"['Ecosystem Approaches To Health', 'Leptospirosis', 'Trinidad']",17500.0,201692,"Leptospirosis, a potentially dangerous disease spread by rodents to humans, occurs regularly throughout the island of Trinidad.  However, information on the disease is not readily available due to gaps in knowledge, poor access to health services and a broad range of symptoms.  A main concern is that the underreporting of cases may be lowering public awareness and funding aimed at preventing it.  As well, future changes to climate in the region could impact the number of people at risk because of the influence of rainfall on disease rates.  To better understand the severity and underlying causes of the disease, research must be conducted to determine how the environment and social factors influence the results of population health studies on Leptospirosis in Trinidad.  

This research project will be supported by the Caribbean Eco-Health Programme (CEHP), a Canadian-funded initiative working with Caribbean health professionals to improve research, training and the transfer of knowledge.  Specifically, blood samples taken from Trinidadian communities by the CEHP-funded mobile laboratory Atlantis will be tested for evidence of Leptospirosis.  Using this information, the researcher will interact with the communities through surveys, interviews and workshops to see what factors are most important to disease risk.  Community involvement in the research process will not only lead to better study results, but will also promote involvement from the local population in the future.  Next, methods in place to address the disease will be evaluated.  Using the knowledge gathered from the study, recommendations can be made for improvements to future strategies.

These fast designs typically involve identifying people who have been tested for COVID-19, often at a test-site or in a hospital. An established design is called the ""test-negative design"" which specifically involves identifying people who have symptoms associated with the disease in question and who then get tested. Scientists can estimate vaccine effectiveness by comparing people who test positive to people who test negative. If the negatives have higher rates of vaccination, this will indicate effectiveness of the vaccine. But, depending on how the design and statistical methods are applied, there may be bias in the estimation of effectiveness.

Our research team has recently noted that, because of challenges of how test data are collected in our healthcare systems across Canada, the classical version of the test-negative design cannot always be applied. For example, some designs have used all test data, rather than only data from those who have certain symptoms. We are interested in evaluating how much bias can be caused by this difference in design, and identifying scenarios in which this can create misleading results.

Secondly, we are interested in developing statistical methods that can address the limitations of the regression approach that is essentially the only one currently being used. We will identify limitations of current methods and propose new (or adapted) methods that can address these limitations. Our goal is to produce more reliable statistical methods so that we can improve our monitoring of the benefits of vaccination."

Globalization of the Food and Agricultural Economies: The Impact of International Trade Policy on Canadian Food Security,"['Schram, Ashley L']",['N/A'],"['Food And Agricultural Trade', 'Food Security Initiatives', 'Food Security Policy', 'Globalization', 'International Trade And Investment Agreements', 'Policy Analysis', 'Social Determinants Of Health']",105000.0,283908,"The World Food Summit defined food security as existing ""when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy lifestyle."" Despite the fact that enough food is produced globally to feed everyone in the world, an estimated 925 million people live with chronic hunger. In Canada, 851,014 citizens accessed a food bank monthly in 2011, the second highest level of use on record. With the increasing integration of world economies there has been rapid growth in the number of regional, bilateral and multilateral trade and investment agreements involving food and agriculture, which has had broad consequences for food security. The capacity of the state to manage public health policy is increasingly challenged by trade and investment treaties that are shrinking the policy space within which food security initiatives can be developed and implemented. This study will conduct a policy analysis to examine how international agricultural trade and investment agreements ratified by the Canadian government, or under consideration and publicly available for review, will influence the success of national food security policies. It will also examine the role of trade and investment agreements in the development and sustainability of local and national food security initiatives and the role of food security actors in trade policy. While numerous examinations have been conducted on the influence of trade on food security in developing nations, to date the body of work studying how global food trade has impacted food security in Canada has been negligible. Understanding the implications of trade policy on government capacity to enact socially responsible public health policy, such as food security, will be essential as we continue down the path of an increasingly globalized economy."

Conversion through conversation: towards an understanding of medical professional identity evolution through everyday interaction,"['Schrewe, Brett']",['N/A'],"['Clinical Teaching Unit Ethnography', 'Conversation Analysis', 'Critical Transformative Dialogue', 'Medical Education', 'Medical/Linguistic/Applied Anthropology', 'Semi-Structured Interviews']",17500.0,226982,"While Western medicine has catalyzed many successes in diagnosis, treatment, and management of disease, there continues to be ongoing dissatisfaction from persons experiencing illness regarding how they are treated by medicine's institutions, systems, and practitioners.  Although there have been significant financial, institutional, and academic investments in curricular reform targeted towards addressing this important issue, it nonetheless continues to exist.  Explorations of the role of language use in producing and reproducing this way of treating patients, specifically pertaining to the content and mechanisms of everyday interaction, have been relatively understudied.     
Through a month-long observation of a medical team on a pediatric ward in a major urban Canadian university hospital centre, we seek to understand how medical students learn to become physicians through their progressive mastery of the use of medical language and the cultural values carried within it.  By a careful recording and analysis of both the language and mechanisms of the conversations conducted in patient presentation rounds, we desire to make explicit which language is learned to be valid and how students' use of it evolves over the course of a month.  
We hypothesize that it is through the process of everyday conversational interactions that alternative and more comprehensive interpretations of patient illness experiences are obscured and marginalized by the illness-as-disease worldview that continues to predominate in Western medical education.  By revealing the nuances of the everyday educational environment through careful conversational analysis, we are well-positioned to challenge the current academic environment and suggest meaningful pathways of reform that will have positive ramifications for physician education, patient care, and vitality of the health care system in general."

Nowhere is this more evident than among Aboriginal children in Canada who are disproportionally affected by a more aggressive form of ECC, called Severe ECC (S-ECC).
The overarching objective is to develop an integrated and interdisciplinary program of research that would identify innovative strategies to address the epidemic of ECC in Canadian Aboriginal children. 
The specific objectives are to 1) evaluate the impact of current oral health programs in Manitoba First Nations communities on rates of pediatric dental surgery for children < 6 years of age; 2) determine the prevalence of enamel hypoplasia among young Aboriginal children and identify the cariogenic flora of children with S-ECC; 3) determine the effectiveness of innovative combinations of chemotherapeutics in addressing S-ECC; 4) improve access to early dental visits and prevention using innovative models of care including telehealth technology and involvement of non-dental professionals; and 5) determine the effects of prenatal and early childhood vitamin D supplementation and nutritional support on early childhood oral health."

We have assembled a multidisciplinary team consisting of Indigenous and non-Indigenous members that will work together to evaluate COHI. To date, there has been no published evaluation on whether COHI improves children's dental health. Despite significant government investments, no real evidence of COHI's impact on children's oral health exists.

We will evaluate the impact of COHI program in communities in different regions of Canada (Manitoba, Atlantic Canada, and Ontario), representing six of 10 provinces. We propose a mixed-methods evaluation to determine the impact that COHI is having among young First Nations and Inuit children and families. Three projects will be undertaken. Project 1 looks at comparing rates for pediatric dental surgery to treat severe early childhood tooth decay in Manitoba between COHI and non-COHI communities. Project 2 will analyze data from the COHI database to determine whether children from COHI communities are receiving more preventive services and needing less dental treatment or referrals for dental surgery in hospital. Project 3 will involve interviews and focus groups with COHI staff, parents and caregivers of young children, and community members to find out their attitudes, beliefs, and values about COHI and the impact it has on young children's dental health."

This proposal is submitted to continue to work with First Nations and Metis communities in the spirit of Reconciliation to deal with the problem of early childhood caries (ECC) (tooth decay). Past funding from CIHR allowed us to work with four Manitoba communities to tailor the Healthy Smile Happy Child (HSHC) initiative so that it was culturally appropriate. The aims of this application are to: i) add in traditional oral health teaching to the HSHC initiative in new partnering First Nations and Metis communities in Manitoba and ii) introduce the practice of caries risk assessment (CRA) (judging a child's risk for tooth decay) by non-dental healthcare staff as a way to improve access to dental care. HSHC has had success in promoting good early childhood oral health, improving knowledge, attitudes, and behaviours, and preventing ECC. CRA is a promising way to increase access to early childhood dental health assessments and to create dental homes (i.e. clinics where children get ongoing dental care) for children. 
   The main goal of this project is to deal with the problem of ECC experienced by Indigenous children in Manitoba. This will be done in two ways. Objective 1 will add traditional oral health teaching to improve and strengthen the HSHC initiative. We will study changes in parents' attitudes, knowledge and behaviours about ECC and changes in young children's dental health. Objective 2 will study the practice of CRA by non-dental healthcare staff as a way to improve access to dental care. We will study if CRA leads to the successful uptake of this practice, more children receiving dental health assessments, improved access to dental care, and increased the number of children being referred to dental offices to create dental homes for them."

Unfortunately, many Canadian children develop early childhood caries (ECC), defined as decay in the primary teeth in those < 72 months of age. Caries in children is a major public health problem and more frequently affects those facing social and economic inequalities and poor access to oral health care, such as children from low-income households, First Nations, MÃ©tis, and Inuit peoples, refugees and recent immigrants, and children living in rural and remote regions of Canada. 

This Applied Public Health Chair on ""Public Health Approaches to Improve Access to Oral Health Care and Oral Health Status for Young Children in Canada"" has four priorities: 1) Research that strives to improve the oral health of young children by focusing on ways to improve access to early risk assessment, prevention, and oral health care; 2) Mentorship that builds capacity for future oral health and health services research; 3) Integrated knowledge translation, exchange, and mobilization; and 4) Partnerships with decision-makers and stakeholders to bridge the gap between research, practice, and policy.

This program consists of two Aims that address the significant oral health gaps that exist in Canada. Aim 1 will evaluate the roll-out of the Public Health Agency of Canada funded Canadian Caries Risk Assessment (CRA) Tool for children < 6 years of age. This evidence-informed CRA Tool was developed for use by non-dental primary care providers to improve access to early oral health assessment and prevention for young children. Aim 2 will evaluate of the impact of the Interim Canada Dental Benefit (CDB) and the Canadian Dental Care Plan (CDCP) on access to oral health care for children in Canada using a mixed-methods approach. The Interim CDB for children < 12 years began in October 2022 while the CDCP is proposed to commence by the end of 2023."

The number of First Nations People with heart disease is higher, the age at which heart diseases are diagnosed is younger, and their post heart attack health is worse. While high rates of cardiovascular risk factors play a role, difference is treatment trends also plays a factor. Still the type of evidence available influences our understanding of health difference and guides how to address it. Health topics are commonly known through a western scientific/biomedical worldview, which tends to focus on physical symptoms, health interventions, and individual blaming for lifestyle choices. The dominance of a biomedical perspective is often privileged at the expense of silencing and delegitimizing alternative ways of knowing; such as Indigenous knowledge and evidence of historical and colonizing factors influencing health. Sustaining this privilege of western science and biomedicine is unlikely to diminish health burdens and arguably will serve to increase inequities. A four year study using multiple research methods will be governed by a two-eyed seeing approach and decolonizing methodologies in an effort to disrupt use of a singular worldview. Diverse First Nations and healthcare community members have shaped the development of this study, which values and respects biomedical, Indigenous, and historical/decolonizing perspectives concerning heart health among First Nations People. Evidence from this study will extend our understanding of coronary artery disease severity and complexity, long term health outcomes, and experiences from the perspective of First Nation patients, family members, and Elders.

Before the 1950s, type 2 diabetes (TTD) was unheard of in most Indigenous populations. However, since the number of Indigenous peoples with TTD has increased and age of diagnosis is younger than in the general population. Current treatments for TTD are based on a biomedical worldview, or western science, such as increased physical activity and dietary changes. Health from this worldview focuses on the physical body. Most Indigenous people, however, look at the whole body (emotional, spiritual, physical and mental) in relational to the land. Since Europeans, the colonizers, came to North America or Turtle Island, Indigenous people have lost their relationship to the land, gathering and hunting less traditional foods while rates of TTD continue to rise.
To address this, a diverse group of settler and Indigenous peoples developed a 4-year multiple-methods study that will use Indigenous methodologies, such as ceremonies, stories and oral history, which will be guided by 4 Elders. The study aims to value and respect Indigenous, biomedical, and historical perspectives of health and TTD using decolonizing and two-eyed seeing approaches. Research objectives to address are to: 1) Create spaces to elevate Indigenous knowledge relevant to TTD, relation to the land and traditional foods; and 2) Collaboratively build bridges between Indigenous knowledge and places where Indigenous people access TTD healthcare services. The hope is that new pathways to address TTD will be realized through Indigenous peoples' awakening to original teachings of the importance of the sacred relationship to the land."

For many Canadian populations, particularly rural and remote, adolescent, and structurally disadvantaged groups, inadequate access to family planning services (contraception, abortion) prevents the ability to time and space pregnancies and births. In these groups, mistimed or unwanted pregnancies continue to be frequent, leading to poor reproductive outcomes and limiting gender equity.  In the past 5 years, substantial changes to Canadian health policy and practice were implemented to address inadequate and inequitable access to reproductive health services. The impacts of these policy and practice changes on reproductive population health and equitable family planning service access are unknown.

My research will harness the power of Canada's rich population-based health data to rigorously examine policy and practice impacts on reproductive population health. I will work with patients, clinicians, and policymakers to identify priority research areas and inform policy and practice improvements based on research findings. 

SPECIFIC AIMS:
1.Determine impacts of abortion pill availability as a normal prescription on patient access to abortion in BC and Ontario.
2.Determine impacts of contraceptive implant introduction and no-cost contraception subsidy on contraception use, pregnancy rates, and pregnancy outcomes.

Increases in frailty predict poor health outcomes, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD).The standard approach for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk screening in Canada is the Framingham Risk Score (FRS). However, in an eight year follow up study of older adults, the FRS poorly discriminated between those who had onset CVD and those who did not, and this absolute risk was specifically underestimated in women (51%) versus men (8%). A suggested method of improving CVD risk assessment is through the addition of frailty biomarkers. In fact, there is an emerging recognition that metabolites in our blood can be analyzed to detect the early development of frailty-related chronic conditions. However, no prior studies have determined if adding specific metabolites to an established CVD risk score improves its sensitivity/specificity. I will address this knowledge gap. Study 1 will measure metabolites in blood samples collected from the 985 women (age 55 and older) who participated in the Assessment of Large and Small Artery Elasticity for the Early Detection of Cardiovascular Disease trial (NCT02863211) for the purpose of identifying metabolites that are associated with CVD risk and frailty. A new CVD risk assessment model will then be created that includes the candidate metabolites. Study 2 will then determine if the new CVD risk model better predicts CVD outcomes than the traditional FRS in a different cohort of 1000 females who are 55 years of age or older and participating in the WARM Hearts trial (NCT03938155). My data will support the development of more precise early diagnostic tools to assess CVD risk in older adults."
A Longitudinal Examination of Childhood Sexual Abuse and Motivations For Sex As Predictors of Sexual Health Among Homeless Youth,"['Schwartz, Danielle']",['N/A'],"['Child Sexual Abuse', 'Homeless Youth', 'Motivations For Sex', 'Sexual Functioning', 'Sexual Health', 'Sexual Risk Behaviours']",105000.0,206204,"Rates of childhood sexual abuse (CSA) are disproportionately high among homeless youth. Past research has demonstrated that CSA is associated with a range of sexual risk behaviours, poor sexual health outcomes, and problems with sexual functioning. However, the mechanisms underlying these relationships remain unclear. Based on past models which posit that CSA may influence individuals' sexual development and norms, it is expected that motivations for sex may be affected by CSA experiences. The proposed study will examine how CSA is related to changes in sexual risk behaviours, sexual health, and sexual functioning over time in homeless youth. In addition, it will examine if an individual's motivations to engage in sex will explain these relationships.  Ultimately, the goal of this research is to improve the long-term health outcomes among homeless youth in Canada. By exploring the role of motivations for sex in the relationship between CSA and poor sexual health, this study may guide future behavioural interventions aimed at improving sexual health outcomes in this high-risk population."

Jurisdictions implementing community antibiotic A&F programs will benefit from tools and resources to optimize effectiveness. Research that builds on existing knowledge to advance the field of A&F is needed. Important questions remain surrounding the optimal data to use and methods of data delivery to clinicians, tools to incorporate data into practice, and ensure sustainability over time. We propose assembling an international network of antimicrobial stewardship, primary care, and implementation science (with A&F expertise) experts, which will bring diversity in expertise, geographical locations, career stages, and genders. The network will be coordinated by three co-leads; antimicrobial stewardship (Schwartz), primary care (Lindbeak), and implementation science (Ivers). With overall objectives to provide best practice resources on conducting A&F interventions on antibiotic use in primary care and define research priorities to advance this field. We will employ a modified Delphi method to solicit input, while minimizing bias, from subgroups of experts via video conferencing and 2 multi-day in-person meetings over two years. There is also a contingency plan to host virtual meetings due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions. We will leverage existing international collaboration with the A&F MetaLab, to facilitate ongoing knowledge translation. Multiple outputs from this network, including a systematic review, best practice resources and toolkits, and a paper outlining research priorities, will be organized into publishable peer-reviewed manuscripts as part of a broader dissemination and knowledge translation plan that leverages existing stakeholder networks among this diverse network."

Over 90% of antibiotics are used in the community, and up to 50% of these antibiotic prescriptions are unnecessary, making this sector a critical partner for antimicrobial stewardship efforts which aim to use antibiotics more judiciously. Peer comparison audit and feedback, which involves measuring and comparing an individual's professional practice to their peers, is an effective stewardship activity. Coordinated national efforts are urgently needed to reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing which will improve quality of patient care by reducing medication side effects, costs to the healthcare system, and preventing a future scenario where antibiotics are no longer effective in treating common or serious bacterial infections.

This project involves policy makers, stakeholders, and researchers from across Canada to participate in a national collaboration and study of providing feedback to primary care providers about their antibiotic prescribing. Building on existing provincial programs, this study will coordinate and support provinces and territories delivering feedback to family doctors signed by Dr. Theresa Tam, Chief Public Health Officer at the Public Health Agency of Canada. This study we will also include a randomized controlled trial testing different ways of providing this type of feedback to see if we can improve the effectiveness of this intervention. This national collaboration will build research capacity in Canada, reduce unnecessary antibiotic prescribing, and generate evidence to inform national and provincial action plans to combat rising drug resistant infections."
Preventing tuberculosis in Inuit communitiies:  Predicting what may work,"['Schwartzman, Kevin', 'Alvarez, Gonzalo G']","['Long, Richard', 'Menzies, Richard']","['Cost-Effectiveness Analysis', 'Decision Analysis', 'Inuit', 'Social Determinants', 'Transmission Model', 'Tuberculosis']",141692.0,306015,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the most important global public health problems.  In 2012, Aboriginal people had a TB incidence rate 6 times higher than the Canadian average, a pattern which dates back 120 years. In Nunavut, the rate was 50-fold higher (234/100,000).  In 2011-12, there was a severe outbreak in one Nunavik village: 10% of residents were diagnosed with active TB.  TB rates in Nunavut exceed those in many developing countries. Smoking, heavy alcohol use, overcrowded housing, and diabetes are all strong risk factors for developing TB, with the first three very common in the North. There are several potential interventions to address these conditions in Nunavut and Nunavik.  Reducing their frequency may substantially reduce TB disease.

Using computer programs that simulate the spread of TB, we will predict the benefits and cost effectiveness of two potential ways to improve TB control in Inuit communities.  The computer simulations will be based on past and current data about TB epidemiology as well tobacco and alcohol use, diabetes, and housing.  

The first way focuses on general health, and includes: 
i) smoking prevention/cessation, 
ii) reduction of heavy alcohol use, 
iii) diabetes prevention, 
iv) improved housing. 

The second, TB-specific way involves
i) enhanced diagnosis and treatment of dormant TB infection
ii) diagnosing people with active TB disease earlier in the course of illness
iii) a new, rapid laboratory test for active TB which can be performed in the North. 

These allow preventive treatment and earlier diagnosis, potentially reducing mortality and transmission. We will compare predictions of active TB cases prevented, deaths prevented and quality-adjusted life years gained, and costs. The latter will include costs borne by patients and families.

This research will help community members, health care providers and funders to choose the best approach to tackling the complex TB epidemics in Inuit communities."

The World Health Organization has set key targets for TB reduction and elimination. For countries like Canada, with higher income and lower TB incidence, the targets are to reduce incidence to 1 case per 100,000 population by 2035, and to 1 per million by 2050. However, Canadian TB rates have not changed for over a decade, and have reached a plateau just under 5 cases per 100,000. Over 70% of these cases occur in foreign-born persons. Progress toward elimination will not be possible without better approaches to prevention in this group.

This proposal uses computer simulation of tuberculosis epidemiology and trends to examine the potential impact and cost of potential new approaches, over the period between 2020 and 2050. Specifically, we will:
1.Predict the long-term epidemiologic and economic impact of broadened pre- and post-migration screening for dormant TB infection among migrants to Canada.  
2.Predict the impact of shorter, more effective, and safer treatment regimens for dormant TB infection, as well as the impact of new technologies, such as better tests for dormant infection, and a new TB vaccine, among migrants. 
3.Consider the impact of investment in specific elements of TB prevention and care in high-incidence countries, with respect to their downstream implications for Canada and other countries which receive large numbers of migrants.
4.  Consider the ethical implications of these new approaches, including potential stigmatization and treatment risks.

This work will provide relevant information to decision makers, including public health and immigration medical authorities.  It will also pave the way for better information sharing and input from affected communities.  Findings will also be highly relevant to other low-incidence, higher-income, migrant receiving countries."

Of the various approaches reviewed, counseling parents/caregivers through Motivational Interviewing and coaching appears to have a great deal of potential.  The current proposal describes a Pilot intervention that will begin to assess the effectiveness of this approach in promoting smoke-free homes among Ontario families.  The purpose of this Pilot Intervention is to reduce SHS exposure by creating smoke-free homes.  Pilot study objectives are: (1) To evaluate the preliminary effectiveness of a Pilot intervention in reducing children's exposure to SHS through the establishment of smoke-free homes, (2) To evaluate the preliminary effectiveness of the Pilot intervention in reducing asthma symptoms and hospital emergency department visits, and (3)  To determine the feasibility of having Certified Asthma Educators deliver the Pilot intervention.  Parents of young children will be recruited through Primary Care Asthma Centres (PCAPs) - initially in Windsor, Ontario (fall, 2009) then in 2-3 additional locations (spring, 2010).  Certified Respiratory Educators (CREs) attached to the PCAPs will provide a series of counseling sessions with participating parents in order to assist them in creating smoke-free homes.

We will determine the effectiveness of tailored and evidence informed community-developed strategies in reducing commercial tobacco use and assess the implementation factors that contribute to their success.  In Canada, First Nations (on and off-reserve), Inuit and MÃ©tis Peoples have remarkably high rates of commercial tobacco use and associate chronic lung and other diseases compared to non-Aboriginal groups. RETRAC2 builds on a previous study (RETRAC1), where 7 Aboriginal communities conducted research to understand their community's contexts of tobacco use and develop tailored community commercial tobacco reduction strategies.  RETRAC1 included a systematic review of literature and studied Aboriginal communities around the world that had success in reducing commercial tobacco use. RETRAC2 provides opportunity for the 7 RETRAC1 communities to implement and evaluate their interventions and for 6 new Aboriginal communities to conduct community-based research, develop and begin to implement their own commercial tobacco reduction strategies. Developmental evaluation research on implementation factors and successes in these varied contexts will provide rich learning for scaling up the RETRAC approach for routine implementation in Ontario and beyond. Successful reduction of commercial tobacco use in Aboriginal communities will begin to address a historic crisis that is one result of contact /colonization. It is vital to close the very large gap in the relative health burden experienced by Aboriginal as compared to non-Aboriginal people in Canada. Participation in the GACD network will both contribute to RETRAC2 and facilitate dissemination of knowledge gained to prevention of chronic lung disease work in LMICs and amongst vulnerable population in HICs."

This happens because the body's pancreas no longer produces enough insulin. If there is not enough insulin, sugar remains in the blood, and with time, this high blood sugar levels cause premature aging. People who live with diabetes require medical support and need to manage daily tasks, referred to as self-management. Self-management includes managing one's diet, physical activity, stress, medications, and appointments. Indigenous people carry higher burdens of diabetes and poorer diabetes outcomes. There are many social barriers that prevent Indigenous populations from accessing supportive resources. Growing evidence suggests that peer mentorship is a promising approach to enhance diabetes self-management. Peer mentorship connects individuals with community members from similar life and health conditions who have been trained to provide social support and education and to share practical ideas for managing their health. However, the key elements of Indigenous peer mentorship are not currently known.

My research question will be: What is Indigenous peer mentorship that can support Indigenous individuals managing diabetes? Starting with community, I will organize an Indigenous advisory group to guide this research. I will then explore what Indigenous-focused peer models to diabetes care already exist in Canada. Subsequently, I will develop a better understanding of how peer mentorship works for Indigenous individuals with diabetes through focused conversations with experts and explain my findings through a framework. 

The framework I develop will be useful to inform future care providers and members of the public to support Indigenous individuals managing diabetes in their communities. The knowledge created from this research may help reduce the burden of managing diabetes on individuals and healthcare systems, by including communities who want to help and connect, but may not know how to start."

One way that IPV and other forms of violence affect health is through traumatic stress. Stress is one factor in the development of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death among Canadian women. Recent research suggests that women who have left abusive partners have very high rates of preventable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The stress of IPV is thought to affect physical health through mental health, particularly depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Another way IPV may affect cardiac health is by affecting personal health practices such as smoking and exercise.  A history of child abuse may also increase vulnerability to the physical health effects of adult abuse experiences. This study will explore how the relationships between IPV and cardiovascular health are affected by child abuse history, PTSD, depression, and personal health practices. A model of the relationships among these factors will be developed and tested using statistical modeling techniques. Data to be used in this analysis is currently being collected in the CIHR funded Women's Health Effects Study  a longitudinal prospective study of 309 Canadian women survivors of IPV living  three provinces (NB, ON, BC). Understanding the associations among lifetime abuse, depression, PTSD, personal health practices and cardiovascular disease is important for determining why some women who have left abusive partners experience cardiovascular disease and others do not. These findings will begin to fill the gap in our understanding of factors that influence the cardiovascular health of women, particularly those who have experienced abuse in their lifetimes. A better grasp of how IPV affects the cardiovascular health of women is needed to direct the development of prevention and treatment programs and policies to improve the health of women."

To date, only the small group in-person EAAA (E-triple A - Enhanced Assess, Acknowledge, Act) sexual assault resistance program has been proven to reduce the risk of sexual assault. In a clinical trial at 3 Canadian universities, 1st year women students who took EAAA were 50% less likely to experience rape or attempted rape in the next year than women who did not receive the program. The in-person format is clearly effective but the need for staff resources at each university to implement it locally is an obstacle to expanding the program's reach. This research will examine whether a new version of EAAA called IDEA3 (IDEA cubed - Internet Delivered EAAA), which was systematically adapted for online delivery, is also effective in reducing sexual assault. We will conduct a clinical trial at 4 diverse universities (2 each in Canada and the U.S.). 1st year women students (N=1920) will receive either IDEA3 or an online workshop on consent. Women students will participate in face-to-face pairs within a small online group of 16 women to ensure that women who take IDEA3 have emotional support and self-defence practice more comparable to women who take in-person EAAA. Consultations with online learning specialists and multiple rounds of pilot testing and revision have confirmed preliminary feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Participants will complete online surveys 1-week before and after completing their program and again 6 and 12 months later. Rates of sexual assault experienced by women who did and did not take IDEA3 will be compared.

Improving the Prediction of Adherence to Exercise Therapy for Adults with Arthritis: Use of Exercise-Related and Disease-Related Factors,"['Sessford, James D']",['N/A'],"['Adherence', 'Arthritis', 'Illness Perceptions', 'Psychological Models', 'Rehabilitation', 'Self-Regulatory Efficacy']",17500.0,225010,"Arthritis affects three of five adults. Since no cure exists for this chronic disease, exercise therapy is recommended due to its proven effectiveness in diminishing adults' symptoms of arthritis and improving their health. However, these benefits only result when people adhere/stick with exercise, which is a problem. Up to 60% of adults with arthritis do not adhere to exercise therapy. Little is known about the factors that contribute to whether people adhere or not to exercise therapy. This investigation will use a novel approach to identify factors that may help people adhere to exercise therapy. Factors to be examined include individuals' beliefs about managing their exercise in the face of both arthritis-related barriers(e.g., pain)and exerciser-related barriers (e.g., no time) as well as perceptions about the symptoms and consequences of their chronic disease. These key variables come from two psychological theories:(1),Social-cognitive theory (SCT) which focuses on individuals' confidence beliefs about abilities that influence their adherence, including overcoming barriers, and (2) Common sense model (CSM) which focuses on perceptions that individuals have about their chronic disease symptoms. This approach is unique because past research has primarily used only a model concerned with confidence in abilities to manage exercise in the face of exercise barriers, with limited focus upon the adults' perspective about their chronic disease. The proposed study uses two models to capture factors related to exercise and related to their arthritis, to better explain the extent of adults' adherence to arthritis than previous research. The identification of a greater number of person-specific factors that motivate people to adhere to their exercise therapy has the potential to better inform strategies for change. Such strategies can improve people's adherence. In turn, the likelihood of achieving the expected health outcomes of exercise therapy may be increased."
Forgotten Youth and Photovoice: Using Visual Methodology to Give Voice to Muslim Siblings of Children with Disabilities,"['Sethi, Bharati', 'Baobaid, Mohammed A']",['N/A'],"['Covid-19', 'Disability', 'Immigrants', 'Mental Health', 'Sibling', 'Youth']",149716.0,450597,"The COVID-19 pandemic-induced economic and mental health crisis has disproportionately affected ethnic and racial minority families of children with disabilities, especially newcomers to Canada. For Muslim communities, the pandemic is exacerbating pre-existing systemic inequities due to racial discrimination. Parents struggled to cope with post-migration stressors without access to a full range of resettlement services. Consequently, they relied on their young son and/or daughter with no medical conditions to share caregiving responsibilities for their disabled siblings. Multiple COVID-induced stressors, including losing social interaction with friends/peers, prolonged home confinement, and learning to navigate virtual schooling in a new country, had adverse mental health on Muslim immigrant youth siblings of children with disabilities. Caregiving and translating the public health guidelines and directives that are important in reducing the risk of the virus for their limited English proficient parents put an additional burden on the siblings. 

In partnership with the project's Principal Knowledge User (PKU), Dr. Mohammed Baobaid, the proposed community-engaged and arts-informed research will explore the lived experiences of Muslim immigrant youth siblings of children with disabilities during the COVID-19 pandemic from their perspectives. As part of a Knowledge Translation process, we will use artistic tools developed during the research process (e.g., participant-generated photographs) to disseminate research-generated knowledge beyond the academy to health care and other service providers, service users, health practitioners, and policymakers. Study results will inform effective sex and gender-sensitive policy, practice, and clinical guidelines."

Improving modifiable risk factors - such as reducing consumption of red meat and increasing fruit and vegetable intake, increasing levels of physical activity, reducing overweight/obesity and tobacco smoking, and increasing rates of cancer screening - would reduce these rates. In the present application, we propose holding two knowledge translation activities in Kahnawake, Quebec. The first activity is a workshop aimed at fostering the shared exploration of the priorities in CRC prevention and risk reduction that could form the foundation of a grant application and capacity building to undertake community-defined high-priority CRC research in Kahnawake. The second activity is a public lecture aimed at increasing individual- and community-level awareness of colon health. The workshop will be held on April 23, 2015, and will include health leaders and elders from Kahnawake , academic researchers and clinicians, and cancer organization and government stakeholders. The public lecture will be held on November 19, 2015. Anticipated project outcomes are 1) identified community-led research priorities, 2) an identified team to undertake the high-priority research projects, and 3) increased community awareness of CRC prevention strategies, which have the potential to motivate individuals to improve their own health.

Persons with frequent IBD symptoms report the experience of disease to be a source of stress in their lives, and are more likely to experience significant distress or mental health problems such as anxiety or depression. Previous research by the Manitoba IBD Clinical and Research Centre identified perceived stress as a predictor of later IBD symptom flares, and likewise depressed mood is known to contribute to future IBD symptom burden and poor quality of life. Less attention has been paid to the role of health anxiety on the course and management of IBD. Cross-sectional studies have observed that health anxiety is elevated among those with active IBD symptoms, is associated with greater IBD disease activity after accounting for perceived stress and distress, and predicts more frequent physician visits even when accounting for IBD symptoms. What is not known and is the focus of this project is how the experience of health anxiety impacts symptom burden, quality of life, and health care use in IBD over time. The CIHR-funded Manitoba IBD Cohort study collected validated measures of health anxiety, IBD symptoms, and quality of life from community IBD participants annually for 10 years; this data will now be linked to provincial administrative health records relating to their use of health care services during the 2002-2013 study period, including family physician visits, specialist visits, and overnight hospital stays. This project will further our understanding of the unique role of health anxiety on the disease experience in IBD, and may suggest means of providing support for IBD patients experiencing health anxiety to assist with the management of this chronic illness and more effective and appropriate use of heath care resources."

Individuals with these chronic illnesses suffer spontaneous relapses, hospitalizations, surgery, and regular use of costly medications. IBD therefore has the potential for severe health-related consequences. Community surveys conducted in the Manitoba IBD population have found that many persons with IBD (70%) identify stress as a contributor to disease symptoms. Previous research by the University of Manitoba IBD Clinical and Research Centre has identified perceived stress as a significant predictor of IBD symptom flares when tracked at 3 month intervals. Persons with frequent IBD symptoms also report the experience of disease to be a source of stress in their lives. However, the disease experience of persons with IBD varies widely both between individuals and for each individual over time, making it difficult to assess the precise role of stress and other risks for symptom flares. The development of methods that can sample IBD symptoms and risk factors more frequently and in real time will allow research to precisely investigate these fluctuations in symptoms and predictors of these changes over shorter periods. This study aims to develop experience sampling methods for IBD and to follow a community sample of Manitobans with IBD each week for a year. Changes in IBD symptoms and in potential risk factors such as perceived stress, mood, coping, disability, and well-being will be assessed. Clinical variables such as disease type (CD or UC), phenotype characteristics, disease duration, history of surgery, smoking, and personal characteristics such as age and sex will also be explored. It will then be possible to closely examine how fluctuations in disease symptoms and risk factors may relate over time. With this information, we can develop effective ways to help persons with IBD manage symptoms and risk factors for disease flares."

Our population needs to be informed about the harmful consequences that diabetes, a disease affecting glucose metabolism, can have on the body. Furthermore, citizens must understand that this disease, which is a major burden to health care, can be readily managed or circumvented altogether through healthy living practices. Communications presenting the biological details about diabetes, how drugs treat the disease, and the importance of healthy living could positively alter the way Canadian citizens view this deadly disease.
My project focuses on producing medically accurate communications describing the biological causes of diabetes. Given the many unanswered questions about how to best communicate complex ideas to lay audiences, these communications will vary in their content and will be surveyed for their effectiveness at conveying the severity of diabetes. Furthermore, I will utilize Maya 3D animation software and incorporate feedback received from initial communications to properly visualize the consequences of allowing diabetes to run rampant. In particular, I will produce vivid, step-by-step animations on how diabetes causes cardiovascular disease, particularly atherosclerosis. These new communications will also be evaluated for their efficiency. Furthermore, reluctant patients may be more inclined to take appropriate medications if they knew how the drug works on a biological level. Animations will supplement previous work by detailing how drugs treat the disease state at both molecular and biological levels. Sulfonylureas, drugs that stimulate the release of insulin from the pancreas, will serve as the example drug. The results from this study could help inform the public and may lessen the burden diabetes will have on the Canadian health care system."

TB is a curable disease; however, MDR-TB treatment costs are as much as 100 times greater than those for drug-sensitive TB.  Despite greater costs, MDR-TB is associated with higher treatment failure rates and more deaths.  WHO has called extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB) 'essentially untreatable'. A better understanding of MDR-TB and XDR-TB dynamics is crucial for advancing global TB control efforts, which directly impact Canadian TB control efforts.  MDR-TB exists worldwide and XDR-TB has been found in countries including Canada.  This project will seek urgent answers needed to cope with the challenge of drug-resistant TB locally and abroad.  The proposed study will be undertaken in Lima, Peru, which has one of the highest rates of MDR-TB in the Americas.  However, except for a history of previous TB treatment or having been in close contact with someone with MDR-TB, little is known about why rates of MDR-TB in Lima, Peru is as high and what determines who is at risk for developing or acquiring MDR-TB.  This project seeks to identify social, behavioral and geographic factors associated with having MDR-TB.  Collaborators from McGill University, Montreal, Canada and Cayetano University, Lima, Peru will develop a case-control study to investigate how MDR-TB cases differ from persons with drug sensitive TB and randomly selected community controls who have not developed TB.  The characterization of MDR-TB cases in Lima, Peru will highlight is any subgroups of the population are highest risk for drug resistance.  The results of this study will greatly contribute to the global understanding of MDR-TB and should lead to improved prevention and control of this  deadly disease."
Do we need a new perspective on chronic diseases? The combined effects of workplace stress and socioeconomic status as non-traditional disease risk factors in Canada,"['Shah, Noor-Ul-Huda']",['N/A'],"['Canada', 'Cardiovascular Disease', 'Chronic Disease', 'Diabetes', 'Education', 'Income', 'Occupation Level', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Stress']",1500.0,418427,"Background: Approximately 80% of Canadians over the age of 20 are at risk of developing a chronic disease (CD) such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type II diabetes (T2D). The burden of CDs is not distributed equally with those from lower socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds having higher CD outcomes and poorer health overall. Although the role of stress has often been implicated in the development of CVD and T2D, research in Canada fails to understand the cumulative effects of multiple non-traditional disease risk factors (stress and SES) on CD outcomes. 
Methods: Multivariate logistic regression analyses was conducted using a weighted sample of 78,023 respondents from the Canadian Community Health Survey (2015-2016). Models controlled for age, sex, race or cultural background, body mass index (BMI), and  disease risk factors (smoking status, alcohol intake, fruit and vegetable intake, and physical activity) to understand the true association between stress and SES on CD outcomes. Combined effects of both predictor variables were assessed using multiplicative and additive interaction analysis. 
Results: Self-perceived life stress and SES remained significantly associated to CVD and T2D even after adjusting for disease risk factors. A significant interaction between high life stress and low household income resulted in almost doubling the odds of reporting diabetes (OR=1.89, p=0.03), compared to the product of the individual factors alone. Results support that non-traditional disease risk factors might have cumulative effects on CD outcomes.
Conclusions: Our results corroborate other findings that stress and SES might have independent associations to CD outcomes, even in the absence of disease risk factors. This is the first Canadian study to show the cumulative effects of non-traditional risk factors and why we might need to change our approach to combat incidence of CDs."

The goal of this project is to do research in a better way and improve relationships between health care systems and Indigenous peoples so that health systems and the populations they serve can respectfully and appropriately benefit from Indigenous knowledge and expertise in the area of promoting health equity.
Over the last three years, our team has worked with Ktunaxa First Nation in the Kootenay region of British Columbia to develop and test a new approach to research that is led by Ktunaxa peoples and reflects Ktunaxa culture. Ktunaxa Elders named this approach xacqanal itkinil (Many Ways of Doing the Same Thing). Important features of this approach include: coming together during community gatherings and ceremonies, starting with a shared meal, using traditional approaches for sharing information and solving problems, including everyone's voices, and getting feedback often. 
We tested the xacqanal itkinil approach in Ktunaxa communities by working together to create a Ktunaxa Model of Wellness. During this process, community members shared their ideas about what a healthy community looks like. Community members liked this approach and said that the process was ""really meaningful, really powerful."" 
Testing the xacqanal itkinil approach was the first step along the pathway toward a long-term working relationship between Ktunaxa Nation and Interior Health Authority. The goal of the next step is to use the xacqanal itkinil approach to look at how the health care system can learn from Ktunaxa understandings of wellness to improve health services in Ktunaxa communities."
Pain among elderly South Asian immigrant women,"['Shah, Sonam']",['N/A'],"['Elderly', 'Immigrant', 'Mixed-Methods', 'Pain Perceptions', 'Somali']",8750.0,284471,"The research project proposed will examine pain among elderly South Asian women in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), one of the most diverse areas in the world. Pain is a complex bio-psycho-social experience, and therefore it deserves a broader understanding, rather than simply attributing it to biological factors. At the present moment there is no literature on pain among elderly immigrant populations.  The current literature on pain demonstrates that minority populations remain at risk for inadequate pain control, and the reasons may be due to lack of awareness of how these populations experience pain. As the population of those 65-years of age and over is increasing, there are going to many older immigrants in Canada. There needs to be an understanding of the intersectionality between gender, age, and culture in relation to pain. This is essential for primary care providers to know, because it may affect how they deliver care and how they determine the best treatment options. It is also important for those who work at community-based organizations focused on immigrant and/or elderly populations when planning health-related programs. This is a mixed-methods study that will include 20-25 participants. Interviews will be conducted and participants will complete the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2. Pain is a public health problem as it affects 1 in 5 adults globally. It truly affects the well-being of individuals, and based on the literature, there is no reason elderly people should be suffering from pain in Canada, because there are various treatments available for them."
Assessing The Folate Intake Of Canadians Based On Actual Rather Than Mandated Fortification Levels,"['Shakur, Yaseer A']",['N/A'],"['Canadian Community Health Survey (Cchs) 2.2 Dataset', 'Canadian Milling Industry', 'Dietary Assessment Tool', 'Estimated Average Requirement (Ear)', 'Folic Acid', 'Mandated Fortification Levels', 'Neural Tube Defects', 'Tolerable Uppery Intake Level (Ul)', 'Tri-Enzyme Digestion Analysis', ""Women'S Health""]",70000.0,206206,"Exactly how much folate is in the Canadian diet?  Surprisingly, we don't have a good answer to this question.  Folate fortification of certain grain products was mandated by the Canadian government in 1998 with the hopes of increasing the overall folate intake in the diet.  This was primarily due to the necessity of folate in neural tube development, which occurs very early in pregnancy, when most women are still unaware that they are pregnant.  Because of the success of this mandate at lowering the prevalence of neural tube defects and at lowering the prevalence of high plasma homocysteine concentrations (high homocysteine concentration is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease), there have been calls to further increase the mandated levels of fortification.  Before such recommendations can be taken seriously, we need to first assess the folate in our food supply.  We believe the levels in the food supply are much higher than mandated levels, as has been found in the United States.  This is due to manufacturers fortifying to well above the mandated level in order to ensure that at the end of shelf life, a given product is still over the mandated level.  However, high folate intakes can lead to a masking of vitamin B12 deficiency.  Also, emerging evidence suggests an association between high folic acid intake and an increased risk of colon cancer.  As such, the following question arises: is the level of folate in the Canadian diet proving to be excessive for large segments of the population?  

In light of the above dilemma, the first project of my doctoral research will look to use overage factors determined in our laboratory to re-estimate the prevalence of inadequate intakes of folate in the population, particularly in groups that are thought to be at risk of deficiency.  Secondly, we will re-estimate the prevalence of excessive intakes in the population. Only after such analyses can calls to raise the mandated levels of fortification be brought to the table."

Essential workers need legal protection, accurate information, and supportive working environments. Drawing upon a group of essential, as well as marginalized workers at sea, seafarers, this research will examine the health challenges they are facing during the pandemic, and explore solutions to address the inequalities faced by them. 
This research aims to explore the occupational health and safety challenges faced by Canadian and international seafarers during the COVID -19 outbreak, to understand the impact of public health measures on their health and well-being. It also attempts to identify the regulatory barriers and conflicts negatively affecting seafarers' health and safety that existed in international maritime, health, and labour regulations, and to explore possible policy and management interventions to improve seafarers' mental and physical well-being in the new normal of the pandemic.
The specific research questions are as follows:
(1)What are the impacts of COVID-19 on the health and well-being of maritime workers (Research Area#2)? 
(2)Are there any regulatory gaps/systematic discrimination that exists in public health law and policies, which make seafarers face structural inequalities during the pandemic (Research Area #1)?
(3)What solutions can be developed at the regulatory level, management level, and community level to empower seafarers?
This research will adopt a mixed-method approach, including legal doctrinal analysis, quantitative survey, and qualitative interviews to answer the above research questions. We hope to identify (1) the prevalence of psychosocial distress among seafarers during the pandemic, (2) the limitations of the current legal framework in protecting seafarers' occupational health, and (3) the gaps that existed in the maritime and public health governance system."

Although many examples of HiAP have emerged, the reasons for their successful implementation have not been systematically studied. 

How have jurisdictions with well-established HiAP initiatives facilitated progress in implementation within and across levels of government? Using an explanatory multiple case study, a multidisciplinary team of researchers from the Centre for Research on Inner City Health, Wilfrid Laurier University and the University of Toronto will pursue the following objectives: 1) Conduct seven explanatory case studies of HiAP implementation to elicit rich data on what strategies drive sustainable implementation in a diverse sample of jurisdictions, 2) Synthesize evidence to test and refine theoretical propositions about sustainable implementation of HiAP by carrying out a cross-case analysis of ten case studies, including seven case studies conducted with this grant and three already completed case studies, and 3) Translate results into a series of evidence-based successful practices to support the implementation of HiAP and other ISA globally. 

Our Advisory Group of Canadian and international policymakers will be consulted to facilitate an Integrated Knowledge Translation approach to improve the quality and relevance of research, and the impact of end-of-grant dissemination.

This past LWIFF season, one of the films shown was Paris is Burning. This documentary follows the lives of drag queens living in New York City and their ""house"" culture. For this film night, LWIFF partnered with the Aids Committee of Cambridge, Kitchener, Waterloo, and area (ACCKWA). ACCKWA helped facilitate a discussion that surfaced the realities of harm for 2SLGBTQ+ people, the stigma and discrimination the community faces, and the need for safe spaces to support resilience, social inclusion and prestige for 2SLGBTQ+ folks. 

Another month, LWIFF showed two local films. The first film was called ""Recollections and Imaginings,"" the other, ""Stories from Land Back Camp."" For this film night LWIFF partnered with Land Back Camp, a Kitchener based Land Back movement fuelled by the IndigiQueer, Two Spirit, and LGBTQ+ community. Land Back Camp was co-founded by Bangishimo Johnston and Amy Smoke who co-created this LWIFF event and facilitated the discussion after the films. With Amy and Bangishimo's guidance, the audience engaged in discussions on the lack of safe space for the urban Indigenous community in the region, and the ongoing work of Land Back Camp in creating a more equitable Waterloo region. 

These are two examples of how LWIFF works towards bettering local communities' health and wellbeing by using films as a catalyst for conversation, collaboration, while strengthening public engagement, and awareness. The film nights are held at the local Princess Twin Cinema where they are screened for free and are physically accessible to the public."
Sampling methods for health surveys in difficult settings: a simulation study,"['Shannon, Harry S']","['Bolker, Benjamin M', 'Viveros-Aguilera, Roman']","['Global Health', 'Statistical Simulations', 'Survey Research']",193098.0,253524,"There is often a need for health surveys in Low Income Countries, war zones or areas suffering from disasters. The surveys may measure the health status of the population, such as the proportion of children who have been immunized for infectious diseases. Yet it can be difficult to conduct the surveys because often there is very limited information to allow a proper sample to be selected. Researchers have developed several ways around this problem, but none of these methods is ideal; they all have some flaws, so the final results may be at least somewhat incorrect or have a large margin of error. This project aims to find out which sampling method produces the best results in different situations.

It will do so by using a computer to create virtual populations. The criteria programmed into the computer will try to make the populations as realistic as possible, while varying characteristics such as the proportion of children immunized. The computer will take samples from the virtual populations using the different sampling methods.

Towards a community-based research agenda on the experiences and HIV risk environment of men in the sex industry: The CHAPS Project,"['Shannon, Kate']","['Jollimore, Jody', 'Robert, Wayne A', 'Taylor, Matthew R', 'Chettiar, Jill M', 'Deering, Kathleen N', 'Goldenberg, Shira', 'Kerr, Thomas H', 'Shoveller, Jeannie A']","['Aids', 'Men', 'Men Who Have Sex With Men', ""Men'S Health"", 'Serial Cross-Sectional Studies', 'Sex Buyers', 'Sex Work', 'Sexually Transmitted Infections']",32880.0,289306,"HIV incidence and prevalence in Canada continues to rise, with nearly half of existing and new infections occurring among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM).  Commercial sex sexual networks can play a key role in the risk for HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), due to heightened exposure and high-risk sexual activities within networks, and social and structural vulnerabilities of individuals involved in sex work. There is little known in the Canadian context about how gender and sexual orientation can influence HIV risk to male sex workers (MSWs) and sex buyers. Male sex workers who have sex with men may experience additional and unique forms of stigma and marginalization, including homophobia and transphobia. To date, research on sex work in Canada and globally has focused on female sex workers. This critical gap in existing knowledge MSWs (transgender inclusive) and sex buyers, has resulted in only a partial understanding of the lives and realities of men involved in the sex industry.
We therefore propose to initiate the Community Health Assessment of Men Purchase and Sell Sex (CHAPS) Project, a community-based partnership between the Gender and Sexual Health Initiative (GSHI) and the HUSTLE Program of the Health Initiative for Men (HIM). The purpose of this catalyst grant is to develop the GSHI-HIM CBR partnership, conduct exploratory ethnographic mapping and pilot qualitative interviews to examine themes such as initiation into sex work/buying, sexual services provided/purchased, negotiation of condom use, gender and sexuality, and drug/alcohol use or abuse. In addition, community consultations as well as participatory analysis and knowledge translation activities will ensure that the voices of the men themselves are integrated into this qualitative work as well as the future research agenda. This research will be guided by the expertise and experience of HIM's peer-driven HUSTLE outreach program for male and trans sex workers."

Among women living with HIV (WLWH), most HIV infections are due to heterosexual transmission, with women of Aboriginal ancestry disproportionately affected. Moreover, the sexual and reproductive health needs of WLWH have been largely overlooked, despite that many WLWH, including in Canada, are living with or intending to have children. To date, while there is a large body of research on the individual behavioural, biological, and clinical factors that shape HIV care outcomes, we know far less about the role that laws, policies, gender, stigma, and geography play in shaping access and uptake of HIV care and sexual and reproductive health for WLWH. This is of particular concern, given calls for women-centered sexual health and HIV care and growing concerns of the role of criminalization of HIV non-disclosure and its potential negative effects on women's experiences with HIV care. 

This grant brings together an interdisciplinary and intersectoral team, including social scientists, epidemiologists and clinical researchers, together with knowledge users and collaborators representing community and legal/policy experts to examine the social and policy factors shaping WLWH's access to HIV care and sexual and reproductive health. The project will hire WLWH as peer researchers to help guide the research and dissemination. Given limited studies conducted over time, the proposed project (Sexual Health, HIV/AIDS Care & Women's Longitudinal Needs Assessment, or SHAWNA) will enrol and follow 500 WLWH in Metro Vancouver, Canada over the next five years. This study will create an evidence base to inform improved women-centred sexual health and HIV care. Knowledge translation and exchange will be conducted throughout the study, which will play a key role in informing policy and programs that best promote women-centred sexual health and HIV care in BC, and can be replicated across Canada."

The persistently high rates of health-related harms, violence and mortality among sex workers both in Canada and globally highlight a desperate need for renewed public health interventions targeting the reduction of harms in the sex industry. Building on international guidelines and the CIHR priorities for sex and gender-based analyses, we will aim to evaluate longitudinally the broader risk environment that shapes gendered negotiation of partner-level risk and HIV/STI acquisition among youth and adult women in sex industry work.  To meet these objectives, the proposed research will be based upon the assembly and follow-up of a real cohort consisting of: 1) 500 existing and new adult women working in both the street and indoor sex industry in the AESHA (An Evaluation of Sex Workers' Health Access) I cohort; and 2) 500 female youth aged 14-20 years who have exchanged sex for money, drugs, gifts, shelter or other commodities in the previous 30days in the AESHA II cohort (youth arm).   The novel integration of individual mapping data and neighborhood environment data from publicly- available data sources (such as, housing, violence) will increase the potential for directly informing interventions to reduce harm. To our knowledge this study is among the first prospective studies of sex work in North America. The team I have assembled brings a wealth of expertise in observational and intervention research, policy and sex work, and as such, is uniquely positioned to conduct this study, which aims to directly improve the health of some of the most marginalized youth and women in Canadian society."

Specifically, this research demonstrates how specific social, legal and policy barriers deny sex industry workers and their commercial clients' access to health and safety. For example, key qualitative and mixed methods have demonstrated that sex industry workers in safer indoor spaces experience greater control over their health and that the lack of industry regulatory standards and legitimate avenues for dispute resolution place both sex workers and their commercial clients at greater physical, health and social risk. This work parallels recent public health analyses that female sex workers forced to solicit and servicing clients in outdoor public spaces as compared to indoor settings were 4-times as likely to experience violence or sexual coercion by clients. While this work identifies critical public health and policy gaps, there remains a major lack of dialogue across disciplines for bridging research, policy and practice. Through the initiation of critical sex industry networks in BC and across Canada, in partnership with academic investigators, policy makers and members of the commercial sex community, the proposed project will serve as a catalyst towards an evidence-based response addressing the ethical human rights gaps of sex industry workers and their commercial clientele, to health and safety in Canada."

Of particular concern, increasing evidence suggests this population is at elevated risk for acquiring HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), with preliminary findings in Vancouver suggesting an HIV prevalence of 25% among female sex workers (FSWs). Importantly, emerging theoretical paradigms and global environmental-structural HIV/STI prevention research highlight the need to re-conceptualize women's HIV/STI risk as negotiated interactions, embedded in gendered power dynamics and access to resources, and the broader social, physical, and policy environment. While previous research has identified the individual risk factors for STI/HIV acquisition among FSWs, data has been largely drawn from studies among injection drug users and street involved youth, and there remains a dearth of longitudinal research evaluating the impact of the broader risk environment on HIV/STI transmission among street involved women who exchange sex. The proposed study aims to prospectively investigate how structural inequities (eg. housing insecurity, enforcement), gender-based violence, and power may shape the negotiation of risk reduction with clients and STI/HIV incidence among FSWS in public place-based sex work settings (e.g. bars, streets). As the first prospective study of FSWs and HIV/STI incidence in Canada, this research has a strong potential to contribute to innovative public health and HIV prevention strategies for some of the most vulnerable women in Canadian society. This research is also particularly timely and has the potential to inform ongoing legal proceedings and public policy discussions, as well as serve to help monitor the health and social impacts of major international events (e.g., 2010 Olympics)."

Research suggests that criminalization of HIV non-disclosure can have particularly devastating effects on Women Living with HIV (WLWH), by fostering a fear of police arrest, violence, abuse and engendering concerns regarding breach of confidentiality,1exacerbating HIV-related stigmatization,2,3and reducing trust in health care providers and counselors.4In many cases, the public release of personal information about HIV+ status has resulted in their increased social marginalization and exclusion, detainment and criminalization, as well as deportation for migrants.5-7Criminalization of HIV and associated HIV-related stigma are highly gendered8and intersect with other forms of stigma and oppression, including racism, homophobia and transphobia, as well as stigma against key affected populations (e.g. sex workers, people who use drugs).In an effort to address critical gaps between public health evidence and public policy, and address key issues brought forward by knowledge users (e.g. affected community, service providers, and human rights and legal experts), the proposed grant aims to systematically review and synthesize the evidence onwomen, HIV and the lawboth in Canada and globally. The proposed knowledge synthesis efforts herein will aim to document and unpack how sex- and gender- dimensions (e.g. social ascribed aspects of gender) shape womenâs experiences of the law and HIV, and how this subsequently affect their physical, sexual and emotional health outcomes and access to HIV care. Specifically, over the course of the year, the team will systematically review two key topics on women, HIV and the law:1. The impact of criminalization of HIV non-disclosure onWLWHâs condom negotiation and associated risks(e.g. sexual violence) among WLWH2. The impact of criminalization of HIV non-disclosure onWLWHâs access and experiences with HIV care(e.g. delayed HIV testing or HAART initiation; lack of trust with HIV providers; stigma and discrimination)Over the course of the one-year study, the knowledge synthesis grant will include a comprehensive suite ofintegrated knowledge translation (iKT)efforts to evaluate the strengths, limitations, and gaps in the scientific literature and inform policy and practice pertaining to women, HIV and the law.

Despite bearing a disproportionate burden of the epidemic, these key populations continue to experience dismal access to HIV prevention, testing and treatment, highlighting an urgent need to close the gap in the HIV care cascade for these key populations.

Treatment-as Prevention (TasP) strategies targeting key populations is increasingly being adopted globally to address existing inequities in the HIV care cascade, as evidenced by the UNAIDS' 90-90-90 targets. Although TasP is based on well-established scientific evidence demonstrating the capacity of HAART to reduce morbidity, mortality and onward HIV transmission at the population level, the rapid roll out of TasP has been met with significant caution and concern by the community, policy makers and human rights experts, given the wide range of potential ethical concerns.  As such, community groups and academics alike have highlighted an urgent need to identify and evaluate ethical concerns regarding TasP and document the lived experiences of affected communities.

Aligned with increasing calls by community groups globally for Community-Based Research (CBR) on the ethics of TasP, the proposed CBR project is designed to evaluate the ethical implications of targeted TasP strategies from the standpoint of affected communities. The proposed project builds on a number of successful networks with Community-Based Organizations, AIDS Service Organizations and university-based academics to guarantee true and successful collaborations, develop CBR capacity and leadership, and ensure effective KT and social action.  The CBR approach proposed embraces the Greater Involvement of People living with HIV/AIDS principles and will contribute greatly to improving TasP policy and programming globally and result in a CBR agenda on ethics and TasP for future research applications."

This study is the first to concurrently evaluate HPV vaccine knowledge, attitudes, and the decision-making stage of Canadian parents for their school-aged daughters and sons. Data were collected through an online survey from a nationally representative sample of Canadian parents of 9-16 year old children from August to September 2016. Measures included socio-demographics, validated scales to assess HPV vaccine knowledge and attitudes (using the Health Belief Model), and parents' HPV vaccination adoption stage using the Precaution Adoption Process Model (PAPM; six stages: unaware, unengaged, undecided, decided not, decided to, or vaccinated). 3,779 parents' survey responses were analyzed (1,826 parents of sons and 1,953 parents of daughters). There was a significant association between child's gender and PAPM stage of decision-making, with parents of boys more likely to report being in earlier PAPM stages. In multinomial logistic regression analyses parents of daughters (compared to sons), parents of older children, and parents with a health care provider recommendation had decreased odds of being in any earlier PAPM stage as compared to the last PAPM stage (i.e. vaccinated). Parents who were in the 'decided not to vaccinate' stage had significantly greater odds of reporting perceived vaccine harms, lack of confidence, risks, and vaccine conspiracy beliefs. Future research could use these findings to investigate theoretically informed interventions to specifically target subsets of the population with particular attention towards addressing knowledge gaps, perceived barriers, and concerns of parents."

These drivers are potentially modifiable by immunization programmes but are often not measured systematically, and available measures vary in their quality regarding validity, conceptual clarity, and comparability within and across countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) is leading the development of tools to measure the modifiable behavioural and social drivers of vaccination and provide high-quality and actionable data. To date, the BeSD Childhood and BeSD COVID-19 Vaccination tools have been developed. Building on the BeSD work to date, and in collaboration with partners at the WHO, this project will evaluate the global BeSD tools to comprehensively assess the drivers of HPV vaccination in the Canadian context. The BeSD HPV tool will include a population survey (i.e., quantitative tool) and in-depth interview guides (i.e., qualitative tool). This longitudinal mixed methods research project will evaluate the psychometric properties of the BeSD HPV tools in the Canadian population and then comprehensively assess the drivers of HPV vaccination in diverse Canadians. The outcomes of this research will enable global, national, and local partners to systematically gather and use this data to inform the design, implementation, and evaluation of HPV vaccination interventions. Data generated will identify actionable reasons for HPV vaccination in Canada, with particular attention to program recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic in diverse groups.

We are still unsure of how the neighbourhood environment influences health behaviours. Robust evidence from the evaluation of interventions that modify the built environment is needed. This project aims to better understand if interventions that make recreational facilities and healthy food options available in low-income neighbourhoods improve residents' perceived and real access to health-promoting resources. This research project uses quantitative (survey) data as well as qualitative (interview) data collected from adults living in two low-income Toronto suburbs before and after built environment interventions were implemented. Perceived access to, and actual use of, recreational and healthy food resources will be compared before and after the interventions. We will also explore if the interventions have led to increases in physical activity and improvements in eating habits. This research will contribute to population health and health equity by providing much needed evidence on the mechanisms linking the built environment to people's access to health promoting resources. Findings can inform the expansion of built environment interventions from small projects to wider-reaching ones."
"""Why is it they're fixing the outside?"": Rethinking the Role of the Built Environment in Promoting Health Among Marginalized Communities","['Shareck, Martine']",['N/A'],['Na'],1500.0,418143,"Neighbourhood built environment resources, such as green spaces and recreational facilities, have been associated with residents' health. Objective presence of such resources, however, does not equate to access, use, and a subsequent health improvement. In this  study we explored (1) how individuals experienced their neighbourhood environment, and (2) how social factors interacted with the built environment to shape different groups' use of resources. 

Eight ""go-along"" focus groups were conducted with children, youth, adults, and seniors living in two marginalized neighbourhoods in Toronto, Canada. Participants led the interviewer on a walk through their neighbourhood. At each pre-identified stop, they discussed experiences they had with the place, what they (dis)liked about it, and facilitators and barriers to using the resources available. Informed by a relational approach to place, a content analysis of focus group transcripts, notes, and maps allowed for viewing resource use as emerging from the interaction between individuals and the environment.

Go-along focus groups allow us to harness people's lived experiences of their neighbourhood. Aspects of the social environment, such as perceived safety considerations driven by the presence of people loitering or selling drugs on the property, emerged as a key barrier to using neighbourhood resources. Specific groups, such as working-age women, also identified broader social circumstances, such as having a low income, living in precarious housing, and having to care for relatives, as more important for their health than the built environment itself.

Social factors interact with the built environment to complexify the relationship between the environment, resource use, and health. When designing built environment interventions to foster social inclusion and health equity, we should move beyond an exclusive focus on objective characteristics to also attend to the lived experiences people have of urban spaces."

The city of Sherbrooke (QC) is planning to improve its downtown neighbourhood in the coming years. Because the area has a high poverty rate and a large number of young people live there, local organizations are concerned about negative impacts on young residents through an influx of richer residents, disruption of social networks and social exclusion.  

The goal of our research is to examine how changes to the Sherbrooke downtown neighbourhood impact the way young people feel about their neighbourhood, their social connections and their well-being. We will also assess if impacts vary by gender, educational level, and employment status. 

Young adults aged 16 to 30 years-old will complete a survey before the changes are made and three times after that. We will compare their answers before, during and after to examine impacts. We will also conduct ""go-along interviews"" with participants.

We know active transportation like walking, wheeling, and cycling and public transit can improve mobility and health, but we do not know whether those improvements are felt by everyone in the same way. Cities are focusing on equity more explicitly in their decisions, but researchers like us are looking to produce equity-enhancing research. To do this, researchers and cities need to make specific efforts to connect with a wide range of people, so their experiences and views can be reflected in evidence and policy.  

The INTerventions, Equity, Research, and Action in Cities Team (INTERACT) is a pan-Canadian collaboration of researchers, urban planners, and citizens discovering the impact of built environment interventions on health and equity. As we deliver evidence to our partners, we are looking to learn from community advocates around us on how best to engage equity-deserving populations in our work.  

We propose a Solutions Summit to connect with urban researchers, practitioners and advocacy organizations. The one-day hybrid event held in Montreal will be a mix of panel discussions, workshops, and trainee-led presentations. To discover solutions for reaching, engaging, and recruiting equity-deserving populations, we will learn from inspiring practices from community advocates, identify solutions for equitable reach and recruitment, and build trainee capacity for community-engaged research. Summit learnings will be shared widely through public-facing guidelines and a published commentary. Trainees will be a key part of the organization and delivery of the event.

In this project we will formalize an interdisciplinary team committed to better understanding and supporting intersectoral partnership and collaboration for health promoting neighbourhoods. Through a literature scan and a one-day symposium with researchers and partners from a diversity of sectors, we will (1) identify potential enablers and barriers to intersectoral partnership development and action plan implementation in the context of the Marie-Reine neighbourhood (Sherbrooke, QC), our case example, and (2) develop clear research and intervention priorities to create health promoting neighbourhoods more widely. The intersectoral partnership we build, and research agenda we establish with this planning grant can support other mid-size cities in their quest to (re)design healthy and equitable neighbourhoods, and ultimately, healthy, equitable and resilient cities."

The Amin research group has developed and fostered an excellent rapport with many ethnic communities (e.g., African and South Asian) in the Edmonton region. Their studies found that young children from recent newcomer families suffer needlessly from poor oral health. They have since identified barriers and challenges regarding the beliefs and behaviors of these parents regarding oral health in young children. In turn, the parents do not access existing government and health care system programs and support services. This disconnect between the unmet needs of the young children in spite of the presence of an oral health care infrastructure is an ongoing problem within Edmonton, other Canadian cities, and in other westernized countries.  
The timing is ideal to identify a strategy which will improve both policy and programming to evoke the changes needed to effectively connect with and engage the recent newcomer parents. We have developed strong ties with several ethnic communities and their community-based organizations who are enthusiastic for change but are limited by what they can accomplish. As such, this workshop represents a collaboration between recognized researchers, who have identified barriers faced by newcomer parents and possible strategies to overcome them, and both government and health care system stakeholders who have the ability to modify policies and programs to improve reach and uptake by newcomer parents. By bringing together all stakeholders involved, the proposed workshop has real potential to generate substantial advances in improving the oral health of young children from recent immigrant and refugee families. This information will be valuable to other Canadian centres."

Over the past 6 years, we have worked closely with these organizations to access the newcomers and learn about the oral health needs of these children (birth to 6 yrs). We have also identified barriers to the uptake of existing oral health services specific for these families. These two organizations have invited us to share our research findings to their workers. The proposed event will increase the workers awareness of extensive oral health care needs of the young children.

Objectives: 1) To monitor the incidence and predictors of sex work initiation among young Aboriginal people who use drugs and participate in the Cedar project; 2) To explore the role of poverty, family and intimate relationships, involvement with the foster care system and intergenerational trauma in transitioning into sex work through life history, focus groups and interviews; and 3) To explore sources of resiliency and strength among young Aboriginal people involved in sex work for the purpose of developing culturally safe, resiliency based programming. 
Hypothesis: 1) Sex work involvement is highly associated with transition to injection drug use; and 2) Family systems and cultural resources are sources of strength and resiliency for young Aboriginal people transitioning into sex work. 
Methods: The Cedar Project is an ongoing CIHR funded prospective cohort study since 2003, that monitors HIV and HCV infection among 600 Aboriginal people aged 14-30 using illicit drugs in Vancouver, Prince George and Chase, BC. The Cedar Project Partnership governs the research and knowledge translation throughout the project. A combination of ethnographic and epidemiological approaches will inform this project.  Quantitative analysis will provide prevalence and incidence of Cedar participants involved in/transitioning into sex work and qualitative data will address resiliency and vulnerability to transitioning into sex work. 
Dissemination: Findings related to each of the objectives will be written in manuscripts and submitted to peer-reviewed journals. Adhering to the OCAP principles and the CIHR Guidelines for Research Involving Aboriginal People, two separate reports will serve as knowledge translation for Aboriginal leadership, communities and service organizations."

The Promise of Law for Public Health,"['Shelley, Jacob J']",['N/A'],"['Health Law', 'Law', 'Legal Theory', 'Obesity', 'Private Law Theory', 'Public Health', 'Public Health Law', 'Public Health Theory']",150000.0,247852,"Almost one in four Canadian adults are obese; another 35% are overweight. Overweight and obesity are concerning in terms of associated increased morbidity and mortality, decreased quality of life, and cost to society, with $4.3 billion spent on direct and indirect costs associated with obesity in 2001. This important public health problem is being examined by many disciplines, including law. Many public health law scholars, however, consider legal solutions to the obesity epidemic solely under the paradigm of government intervention through legislation or regulation, and ignore potentially important private law interventions (for example, those falling within the scope of contract law, property law, and tort law, which considers private wrongs and negligence).

This legal study will identify private law remedies that can be used as public health interventions (e.g., limiting use of restrictive covenants on commercial leases for grocery stores; personal injury lawsuits for obesity-related health problems; litigation around misrepresentations and fraudulent claims). The study will further identify opportunities for public health researchers to conduct natural experiments (e.g., examining outcomes of interest before and after a policy change, ideally using a suitable comparison group) which are an important method for understanding and improving public health, since randomized controlled trials of policy implementation or legislation are often impossible. Therefore, this project serves as a legal foundation for future, rigorous explorations into the effects of policy or legislative changes on population obesity. In addition to the practical applications, public health law scholarship will benefit from an articulated vision of the relationship between private law and public health."

This is especially relevant now, with decreasing revenues from drugs and increasing revenues from front-of-store sales. In Phase 1, we will undertake comprehensive ethical and legal analysis to examine the responsibilities of pharmacists as health care providers and as retailers, with a focus on front-of-store products. In Phase 2, we will conduct up to 40 pan-Canadian interviews with pharmacists to explore factors driving front-of-store sales and how pharmacists see themselves as health promoters, and to explore whether any tension exists between their roles. In Phase 3, working with a multi-sector advisory group, we will conduct a policy analysis to synthesize findings from Phases 1 and 2 and provide policy options for facilitating healthy retail environments in pharmacies.
In addition to papers and conference presentations, we will create fact sheets based on our findings that we will share with three key audiences: community pharmacists, provincial regulatory authorities and the pharmacy industry. This research will help to determine ways community pharmacies can support health promotion efforts in Canada."
Arterial Compliance is Improved Following a Community-led 12-week Indigenous Wholistic Health and Wellness Program,"['Shellington, Erin M']",['N/A'],"['Applanation Tonometey', 'Community-Led', 'Health And Wellness', 'Indigenous', 'Lifestyle', 'Vascular Health']",1300.0,400166,"PURPOSE: Indigenous peoples are at a higher risk for many chronic diseases compared to the general population. Colonization and forced assimilation have led to marked changes in traditional roles and healthy lifestyle behaviors. The purpose of this study was to examine vascular health (arterial compliance) prior to and following an Indigenous-led, and community-based 12-week lifestyle program representing Indigenous views of wholistic health and wellness.
METHODS: Indigenous adults were recruited to participate in a healthy lifestyle program through a community walk on National Indigenous Peoples Day (21/06/2018) in an Indigenous community. The program was a once weekly education session on healthy lifestyle behaviours (e.g., traditional diet), including sharing circles and a physical activity component (e.g., walk). Vascular health was measured before and following the program.
RESULTS: A total of 11 participants (1 male; Age = 47.3Â±10.7 yr, Height = 161.1Â±6.4 cm, and Weight = 82.3Â±18.3 kg) completed vascular health assessments. Vascular health (artery stiffness) was improved over the program duration. There were no significant changes in blood pressure or vascular resistance following the program.
CONCLUSIONS: Artery stiffness, an important predictor of vascular health, is improved in Indigenous adults living in rural British Columbia following a 12-week program based on Indigenous worldviews. This data demonstrates health-related benefit of culturally appropriate programs."

The Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohorts (CanCHECs) are large population-based cohorts that link long-form census respondents to several health outcomes and inequalities by socio-economic characteristics and population groups. The 1991 CanCHEC dataset has demonstrated 'proof of concept' for estimating cancer incidence and survival in First Nations and MÃ©tis adults through CIHR funding of collaborative research between Dr. Loraine Marrett at Cancer Care Ontario and Mr. Michael Tjepkema at Statistics Canada (collaborators/co-applicants on this grant). The study showed that First Nations people had significantly poorer survival from most cancer types, and higher incidence of many cancers compared to non-Aboriginal adults in Canada. MÃ©tis also had higher incidence of many cancer types, particularly lung cancer, and poorer survival from prostate cancer compared to non-Aboriginal adults.  While this study provided valuable information on cancer incidence and survival, it had limited ability to measure trends over time (closed cohort) and only used ancestry as opposed to identity (this has been changed in the census after 1991). The evolving CanCHEC dataset presents an unprecedented opportunity to use improved methods of defining Aboriginal populations. The aim of this study is to estimate cancer incidence, mortality, survival, age- and stage at diagnosis, and childhood cancers among First Nations, Inuit and MÃ©tis people using the 2006 CanCHEC dataset. As well, to build on the innovative work underway among FNIM and cancer control partners and effect sustainable and meaningful improvements in cancer outcomes among these communities."

Liquor Policy Review,"" a comprehensive review of alcohol policy in B.C. This report puts forth 73 recommendations with two main themes: (1) increasing the accessibility of alcohol (e.g. permitting the sale of wine in grocery stores) and (2) raising minimum prices per standard unit of alcohol. These recommendations are currently being phased in and will be completed by 2016. Previous studies have shown that accessibility and pricing have significant impacts on public health.
This program of research, completed in partnership with the Centre for Addictions Research of B.C. (CARBC), will evaluate these policy changes by quantifying the effect on per capita alcohol consumption, alcohol-related hospitalizations and alcohol-related deaths. Will implementing policies to increase alcohol accessibility result in higher per capita alcohol consumption? Will this higher consumption lead to an increase in the number and severity of adverse public health effects such as hospitalizations and deaths? Or will an increase in pricing levels counteract this change in accessibility?
The effect on sales and consumption will be analyzed using detailed sales data, acquired annually by CARBC, reported by type of alcohol and type of selling establishment. Time series methods will be employed to detect trends in per capita consumption with respect to the implementation of these policies. Further, the effect of policy change on healthcare utilization and disease burden will be quantified. Hospitalization and mortality data will be acquired from the B.C. Centre for Disease Control and will be used to analyze trends in alcohol-related morbidity and mortality.
This proposed research will provide answers to important questions regarding recent alcohol policy changes in B.C. The results will be both relevant and timely, providing critical information to policy makers on the effectiveness and consequences of these changes."

Research studying recent events in the United States has shown that cannabis legalization has led to increased cannabis use and cannabis use disorders; however, the simultaneous effect on alcohol use and alcohol use disorders is not clear. It is important to study these two now-legal substances in parallel as alcohol is used more widely and is responsible for greater health harms than cannabis in Canada.

This program of research, completed as a collaboration between the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research and the National Drug Research Institute (Australia), will evaluate the effect of cannabis legalization on alcohol and cannabis use and associated mental health disorders. Will cannabis legalization lead to an increase in the prevalence of use of cannabis and alcohol among Canadians? Will Canadians experience higher rates of alcohol use disorders and cannabis use disorders after legalization? Or may Canadians substitute cannabis use for alcohol use and therefore experience fewer negative health consequences overall?

Changes in prevalence and patterns of cannabis and alcohol use resulting from legalization will be studied using Canadian survey sources. Health records will be analyzed to estimate the rate of cannabis use and alcohol use disorders, for a period before and after legalization. Time series methods will then be employed to study the unique effect of legalization, using Australian states as control groups where legalization did not take place.

This proposed research will provide answers to important questions regarding recent substance use policy change in Canada. The results will be both relevant and timely, providing critical information to policymakers in Canada, Australia and around the world regarding the health impacts of cannabis legalization."
"Your Personality and Your Mood: Can Your Personality Make You Anxious, Manic, or Depressed?","['Sherry, Simon B']","['Duffy, Anne C', 'Stewart, Sherry H']","['Anxiety Disorders', 'Anxiety Sensitivity', 'Bipolar Disorder', 'Mood Disorders', 'Neuroticism', 'Perfectionism', 'Personality']",3000.0,236166,"Mood and anxiety disorders are major health problems. In fact, mood and anxiety disorders are among the most common, impairing, and expensive health problems facing Canadians today. An estimated 1 in 4 Canadians will experience a mood or anxiety disorder at some point in their life (Patten, 2008). Mood and anxiety disorders cost the Canadian economy more than $20 billion per year in treatment expenses, premature death, and lowered productivity (Harkness, 2010). The human suffering accompanying mood and anxiety disorders is even higher, with these disorders tied to unemployment, divorce, and suicide (Satyanarayana et al., 2009). Despite their common and their destructive nature, mood and anxiety disorders are often misunderstood and untreated. Increasing the general public's understanding of mood and anxiety disorders is therefore critical.

Research consistently suggests an important role for personality traits in both the onset and the maintenance of mood and anxiety disorders (Bagby et al., 2008). Speakers in the proposed Cafe Scientifique will share current scientific information on three widely studied personality traits: namely, anxiety sensitivity, neuroticism, and perfectionism. Using a relaxed and an interactive style, speakers will discuss the association between anxiety sensitivity and anxiety (Stewart et al. 2008), neuroticism and bipolar disorder (Duffy et al., 2006), and perfectionism and depression (S. Sherry et al., 2008). The objectives of the proposed Cafe Scientifique are to raise awareness of and to foster dialogue on the definition, prevalence, and costs of mood and anxiety disorders; to discuss scientific research linking personality traits (i.e., anxiety sensitivity, neuroticism, and perfectionism) to mood and anxiety disorders; and to demystify and to destigmatize mood and anxiety disorders by engaging in a dialogue on these topics with members of the general public."

Alcohol use disorders and associated diseases and injuries - a national retrospective cohort study from France,"['Shield, Kevin D']",['N/A'],"['Addiction', 'Alcohol Use Disorders', 'Disease Course', 'France', 'Mortality', 'Treatment']",90000.0,361523,"Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) are some of the most severe disease outcomes of alcohol consumption, causing disability and reductions in functioning, as well as leading to an increased risk of death from diseases and injuries causally related to alcohol consumption. Furthermore, the impact of AUDs at the population level is important, due, in part, to the resulting health burdens and the high prevalence of AUDs among the general adult population. Indeed, the global prevalence of AUDs in 2012 was 4.1%.

Despite the prevalence of AUDs and their resulting health burdens, there is little research on the impact of AUDs on cause-specific mortality. As such, the need exists for systematic population-level studies that evaluate the cause-specific risk of mortality for individuals with AUDs. Thus, I propose a study that utilizes the French National Hospital Discharge database for the years 2008 to 2014 (which contains more than 30 million unique cases) to:

1) characterize the French population with AUDs by socio-demographic variables and co-morbidities;

2) assess the effects of treatment of AUDs on the course of AUDs and co-morbidities; and

3) assess the disease course and cause-specific mortality risk for people with AUDs by age and sex.

This project will be the largest study to date of the effects of AUDs on co-morbidities and mortality, and will help to establish the characteristics of people who receive treatment for AUDs. Furthermore, the results from this project will help future studies to evaluate the cost effectiveness of interventions aimed at treating and reducing the prevalence of AUDs, and will inform public health policy decisions regarding how to allocate resources for the treatment of AUDs."

The proposed project will result in the rapid (within one month of project commencement) production of evidence-informed guidelines for alcohol control policy recommendations. Guidelines will be updated monthly as more information is synthesized by the research team. The guidelines will be based on the following three unique research projects:

1. A systematic scoping review which will a) assess the current state of knowledge regarding how similar crises (e.g., economic crises and natural disasters) affect alcohol consumption and resulting health harms, and b) assess the applicability and/or transferability of these data to the current pandemic context.

2. An analysis of existing data sources, including general population survey data and alcohol sales data, to examine changes in alcohol consumption in Canada since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.

3. Individual and group interviews with a diverse set of experts to synthesize knowledge from multiple disciplines and to reach consensus on a) the expected short- and long-term impact of the current pandemic on alcohol consumption and related health harms, and b) policy actions required to minimize the negative health effects from increased alcohol consumption during the current pandemic and future crises.

The results will inform and assist policy makers in determining which alcohol policies should be implemented during the current pandemic and future crises to mitigate alcohol-related harms."

Specifically, a meeting of key stakeholders from Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, and Peru will be convened:

1) To discuss current reporting barriers, monitoring efforts, policies, and strategies regarding violence against women, and whether these monitoring efforts, policies, and strategies take into consideration alcohol and drug use.

2) To discuss potentially acceptable and feasible interventions to improve and address the reporting and monitoring of violent incidents against women, and to determine the fraction of these incidents which involve alcohol and drug use.

3) To discuss potentially acceptable and feasible societal strategies, community/organizational strategies, interpersonal strategies, and individual strategies to reduce violence against women.

4) To create a report of synthesized findings for dissemination to key stakeholders.

The outcomes of this project are multifold. Firstly, this project will increase awareness of violence against women through the knowledge exchange between key researchers and policy makers. Secondly, a full-scale grant application will be developed with the aim of (i) improving the reporting and monitoring of alcohol- and drug-related violence against women, and (ii) identifying, implementing, and evaluating policies which can reduce the occurrence of violence against women."

Skin-breaking procedures during NICU stays have been shown to alter brain structure and functioning, contributing to negative physical and psychological outcomes in both the short- and long-term. It is critical to identify the factors that shape, and mitigate, neonatal acute pain. A recent collaborative observational study by our lab showed that caregiver holding in skin-to skin (bare chested caregiver holding diaper clad infant) during a heel lance was associated with lower brain responses in hospitalized infants. It was shown that holding a baby clothed during heel lance resulted in the highest pain response. The proposed experimental randomized controlled trial attempts to better understand the impact of caregiver holding on infant brain, heart rate, and facial responses to pain. Importantly, the study also seeks to understand why skin-to-skin holding may protect against the effect of pain on the brain by examining whether parent heart rate before and during the heel lance and infant heart rate before plays a role. I believe that parental physiological arousal (heart rate) may be impacting the efficacy of skin to skin holding, as infants are right on the chest and lower parental arousal will result in infant having lower heart rate before and during heel lance. By further understanding the differential impact of various caregiver holding styles on infant pain responding as well as the mechanisms, this study has the potential to shape standard practice for involving parents in their infants' NICU care to optimize outcomes."

Often, financial restraints or immigration law restrictions result in parents leaving their infant children behind to be raised by relatives while the parents financially establish themselves in the new country.  The children are reunited several years later with their parents in the adopted country to attend school.  This new phenomenon of ""satellite babies"" and the extended parent-infant separation is predicted to have a detrimental impact on family relationships.  However, in a culture where having multiple caregivers, such as grandparents, is typical, leaving an infant in a family relative's care may not result in such negative outcomes.  Grandparents may promote parent-child bonding by acting as a secure base from which the child can explore and form a new relationship with the parent.  On the other hand, grandparents may interfere with the parent-child relationship formation if the child's view of the grandparents as the primary caregivers persists.  The proposed study will explore how grandparents affect the attachment relationship when ""satellite babies"" from China are reunited with their parents in their new Canadian home.  Chinese-Canadian ""satellite baby"" families will participate in play interactions and other factors including caregiver stress, sensitivity, responsiveness and depression will be assessed.  This study will offer insight into the qualities of parent-infant relationships within in a Chinese cultural framework and how multi-generational families develop and maintain relationships with their children.  As well, this research will inform clinicians on how best to culturally tailor their therapies to address extended parent-child separations and grandparents as caregivers."

Cerebral Palsy (CP) is the most common cause of physical disabilities in Children, affecting 2-2.5 in every child born in Canada. Research in the past decade has shown consistently that children with cerebral palsy participate less than children without disabilities in different areas such as community life, leisure, and school. Participation restrictions are associated with several factors related to the child and to their environment. Interventions aiming at promoting participation often focus on the child, providing physical rehabilitation to promote mobility,   or adaptations to activities of daily living. Interestingly, it is known that such type of interventions do not readily translate to increase in participation in real life contexts in most of key areas. Moreover, children and youth with disabilities and their families describe that participation in different life situations is fundamental for their perception of a good quality of life, and report that challenges in harnessing the adequate resources to be able to participate in these activities has an impact on their health and well-being. Environmental factors, especially those related to provision of services, information and policies, may contribute more to participation restrictions than factors intrinsically related to the child. Interventions targeting changes in the environment, with an objective of promoting participation, are only recently being investigated.  The objective of this project is to bring together stakeholders to identify factors associated with participation of children with disabilities in the community, and to develop an intervention that promotes participation through changes in environmental factors, specially policies, programs and community access, promoting health living and social justice."

To do so, we will identify all the approaches that countries around the world are using to understand the well-being of children with disabilities and see how we can apply those here in Canada. Then, we will look at all the information Canada is already collecting about the condition of Canadians, through the records of Statistics Canada. We will then ask Canadian experts: families, youth, and policymakers how we can make these relevant for Canadian children with disabilities.  Finally, we will disseminate the results to Canadian children with disabilities of varying abilities, genders and locations to see what they think about what we found and whether anything needs to be added or removed from the data collection processes to make sure they adequately represent their experiences. We hope this framework will inform current policy strategies being developed in Canada so we can work  together to work together for the wellbeing of Canadian children with disabilities, using data."

The proposed PhD project is part of a larger multi-sport, national cohort study (SHRed Concussions - Surveillance in High Schools to Reduce the Risk of Concussions and its Consequences [Primary Investigator: C Emery]). During the 2021-2023 high school and youth club rugby seasons, female rugby participants will be recruited to the study. Baseline testing occurs for all participants at the start of each season. Injuries and concussions will be tracked and details surrounding the injury event will be recorded. When an injury occurs, athletes can visit a study therapist for an assessment. If a suspected concussion occurs, participants are referred to a study sport medicine physician at the University of Calgary or a partner community clinic. Prior to and during the 2022 and 2023 seasons, high school and youth club coaches will be invited to a coach workshop delivered by master trainers to learn the injury prevention warm-up program. The rugby-specific injury prevention warm-up was developed by the Sport Injury Prevention Research Centre (SIPRC) team in collaboration with Rugby Canada, England Rugby, World Rugby, and the University of Bath. Following workshop participation, coaches will teach the warm-up to their team and use the warm-up for the duration of their playing season and research study. The timepoint at which coaches attend a workshop will be recorded. Injury and concussion rates will be compared before and after workshop administration to evaluate the effectiveness of the warm-up program nationally."
Economic Inequalities and Associated Health Impacts Among LGBTQ2S+ People in Canada,"['Shokoohi, Mostafa']",['N/A'],"['Inequality And Inequity', 'Intersectionality', 'Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Two-Spirit, And Queer', 'Population-Based Data', 'Poverty', 'Secondary Data Analysis', 'Sexual And Gender Minorities', 'Social Determinants Of Health']",135000.0,396194,"Lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans, queer, two-spirit and other sexual and gender minority (LGBTQ2S+) people are at elevated risk of poor health outcomes. Limited research indicates that these individuals are also at heightened risk for poverty. To date, there are no studies assessing the extent to which poverty may contribute to health problems among LGBTQ2S+ individuals. This research aims to compare poverty and health outcomes between sexual and gender minority and non-minority Canadians. We will also study how other social positions (e.g., race) can affect the extent of poverty and health inequalities in these populations. Finally, we will assess how poverty may contribute to health inequalities; alone and combined with other social positions. We will address these objectives by examining Statistics Canada surveys (e.g., Canadian Community Health Survey) through the lens of intersectionality. This approach allows exploration of inequalities across groups of individuals who experience multiple forms of oppression (e.g., among bisexual women of color). The outcomes of this research will provide evidence for development of promising interventions to reduce poverty and health inequalities that continue to affect sexual and gender minority Canadians."
Chronic conditions and executive function decline in aging adults,"['Shorey, Carrie L']",['N/A'],['Non-Communicable Diseases'],1045.0,418315,"Executive function is a set of cognitive skills, such as attention and reasoning, that allow persons to control and direct their abilities and behaviours. Having more chronic conditions has been linked to poorer executive function. People with poorer executive function, compared to others, are also at greater risk of dementia. However, few studies have looked at whether the amount of chronic conditions a person gains in a period of time is related to executive function. Therefore, this study explored the relationships between the number of and accumulation of chronic conditions on executive function overtime in aging adults.

This study used data collected over a nine year period from the Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS). Participants (2,532), aged 33-84 (mean age 55), completed telephone interviews, including a cognitive test, and questionnaires providing personal and health information. Twelve chronic conditions were included in the study: diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, heart disease, cancer (excluding skin), arthritis, asthma, obesity, neurological problems, stroke, depression and autoimmune disorders.

Having a certain number of chronic conditions was not associated with executive function decline over time. However, people who had accumulated more chronic conditions in a ~9 year period were more likely to see executive function declines. This was also seen in those who were older, Black, and unemployed or retired. This research highlights high-risk groups that preventative efforts may want to focus on, as accumulation of chronic conditions may contribute to poorer cognitive health."
Regulatory Policy and the Availability of Psychopharmacologic Agents,"['Shorter, Edward']",['N/A'],"['Drug Regulation - History', 'Psychiatric Disorders - Drug Treatment', 'Psychopharmacology - History']",75000.0,176786,"According to its official mission statement, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is responsible for protecting and advancing the public health by ensuring the availability of safe and effective products.  Yet our previous research indicates that in the area of psychiatric drug regulation, the agency's policies have instead resulted in outcomes detrimental to the public health, specifically:

1. The approval of new drugs that are less effective than the best medications already available.
2. Drugs released much later in the United States than in other countries, or not licensed at all.

The proposed research sets out to answer the question, How did these both of these problems arise?  The study will use historical research methods to trace the evolution of regulatory policy and decision-making at the FDA, based largely on primary records either still in the agency's custody or transferred to the National Archives and Records Administration.  Details concerning drugs licensed in the United States and other jurisdictions will be assembled from a wide variety of sources, including regulators' lists, national formularies, comparative studies, and medical/pharmacologic literature."

The current application describes a plan to launch a program of research to better address the complex set of health and social issues pertaining to young men's health (e.g., <30 years), with particular attention to young men's sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and HIV-related health experiences and outcomes. The objectives of our Team are to:

1.     Investigate and identify the mechanisms through which social and structural influences affect men's health in relation to STI/HIV in two broad domains: (a) young men's experiences with prevention, treatment and care utilization; and (b) young men's interactions with interventions in sectors other than health (e.g., education; housing; employment; social services);
2.     Identify the relative impacts of interventions within and beyond the health sector on young men's STI/HIV status and analyze how these impacts might vary across subgroups of young men.
3.     Develop capacity to support intervention research and use this new knowledge to inform more ethically just and socially robust ways of intervening to promote young men's health, particularly in relation to STI/HIV.

Our Team and trainees will combine quantitative and qualitative data with mixed-methods expertise to inform the development of novel targeted and tailored interventions, aimed at improving young men's STI/HIV experiences and outcomes. Furthermore, our work in partnerships with YouthCO and the BC Ministry of Health will inform government actions to reduce the rate of new infections among this population as well as community-based strategies and programs pertaining to young men (e.g., Mpowerment). Thus, our work has excellent potential to move beyond the descriptive to achieve improvements in the intervention-relevance of the ""science"" in this field."

The STI/HIV Division at BC Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC) has recently developed GetCheckedBC (GCBC), a new online STI/HIV testing intervention. Youth are important target clients for the GCBC. Targeting interventions towards population sub-groups (e.g., young people) is not a new strategy. However, the population health ethical implications of targeting population subgroups are only beginning to be examined. Little is known about how this approach to intervention may operate differentially within and across targeted groups and there is concern that these approaches may exacerbate health inequity (particularly among the most vulnerable population subgroups). Furthermore, targeted approaches tend to be heavily focused on agentic practices (that is, on changing the individual behaviour), rather than structural interventions (on changing the conditions in which the behaviour occurs).  
This proposal brings together an interdisciplinary team of researchers and trainees who are new to the field of ethics. The proposed pilot study nested within the current application will examine how the GCBC experience attempts to ameliorate individual risk, as well as the ways in which it deploys an institutionalized discourse that attempts to deconstruct social structures that (re)produce social injustices (e.g., heteronormativity; misogyny) that have important implications for young people's sexual health. The pilot study also will form the basis of two PhD dissertations. Overall, this provides a first step towards strengthening new proposals related to population health ethics to be submitted in other CIHR funding opportunities"

This proposed project will study population health information interventions aimed at young parents, including but not limited to the new British Columbia Nurse Family Partnership (NFP). Taking an in-depth, qualitative approach, this study will explore how and why information interventions impact health behaviour and equity and take into nuanced account the multiple, concurrent influences of context and social determinants. The proposed study will: 
1) Describe the perspectives of childbearing and parenting youth, as well as service providers, on existing and unfolding population health information interventions, including the NFP and other interventions directed at young parents both within and outside the health sector.
2) Examine the extent to which community, academic and government stakeholders dialogue to generate policy-relevant information in this substantive area.
3) Use the data generated in the proposed study to inform the development of a set of knowledge exchange activities to enhance the likelihood that population health information interventions will positively affect health equity in this area.

Partnering with community organizations that serve young parents (ages 15-24), we will conduct interviews over a period of 2 years with 30 young parents, and conduct participant observation at young parent program service sites. We also will examine perspectives of service providers and policy/program decision makers in order to gain further insights into the potential complexities and nuances of engaging in population health information interventions."

We acknowledge that many aspects of a young person's social position interact to determine their use of testing (furthermore, service providers also are influenced by social context). In BC, at least three sub-groups of youth may be considered priority populations (youth who identify as LGBT; racialized youth; street-involved youth).

Seeking STI testing remains a deeply stigmatized behaviour, a reality that is unlikely to be fully remedied by online services (e.g., face-to-face enactments of gendered stereotypes can also be represented online through a text-based medium). Unfortunately, we do not yet fully appreciate how important social factors (e.g., social norms; stereotypes about men's and women's responsibilities for sexual health) affect experiences with online STI testing (particularly within vulnerable subgroups of youth). Thus, the proposed study will seek to better understand youth's perspectives on the ways in which important aspects of their social contexts (e.g., stigma; gendered stereotypes) affect their engagement in this and other sexual health promotion activities. Multiple data collection and analysis techniques will be used (e.g., focus groups and individual in-depth interviews; a Youth Roundtable to refine analysis from focus groups and individual interviews and a Youth Working Group will be formed to provide insights into the development and design of the look, feel and content of website). Throughout the project, a series of ""Reality Checks"" with youth also will be used to obtain feedback on emerging versions of the website, with a particular emphasis on checking in with vulnerable subgroups of youth.

Across Canada, many young people experience serious health and social problems related to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unwanted pregnancies. Despite public health efforts, STI rates among youth are high and rising; and, while teen pregnancy rates are leveling off within the population in general, the health and social impacts of these problems manifest disproportionately among vulnerable populations. Moreover, as sexual health inequities grow, conventional interventions appear to be increasingly disconnected from youth's primary prevention needs, especially the needs of vulnerable sub-groups of youth.

Our research program is integrated within a set of established and growing partnerships amongst researchers (UBC; BC Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS) and our collaborative linkages with: (a) the public health system (e.g., BC Centre for Disease Control; Regional Health Authorities); (b) decision-makers in sectors other than health (e.g., education; social services; employment; housing); and (c) relevant NGOs and youth-led organizations (e.g., OPTions for Sexual Health BC; YouthCO AIDS Society; Native Youth Sexual Health Network). Together, we will launch multiple studies that are conceptually linked and will be implemented over the next 5 years, with the components of our proposed studies necessarily (and beneficially) informing one another to:

1.Identify the mechanisms through which population-level interventions enhance or detract from youth sexual health.  
2.Describe how population-level interventions can be scaled-up effectively to avoid exacerbating existing sexual health inequities, particularly amongst vulnerable sub-groups of youth.  
3.Assess the relative impacts on youth sexual health of population-level interventions within and beyond the health sector."

1.To identify and track the dominant narratives appearing in policy and programming documents pertaining to STI/HIV testing of young men in three types of places (e.g., low-, middle-, and high-income settings) and to examine whether particular values and ethical principles are privileged in the discourse presented across these documents and over time;
2.To analyze interview accounts from men, service providers and policy makers regarding their experiences with STI/HIV testing interventions in order to assess the ways in which equity issues (e.g., population-level benefits as compared to individually-oriented benefits; more immediate impacts juxtaposed to longer term effects) are perceived and experienced in a variety of settings; 
3.To assess the ways in which dominant institutional discourses regarding STI/HIV testing for young men are taken up (or rejected) and how that might vary across settings over time."

For example, for today's young men, the availability of effective treatment for HIV infection is a potential ""game changer"" and the socio-cultural contexts in which they launch their sexual careers are profoundly different from those experienced by previous generations. Today's young men are exposed to evolving gender stereotypes, a proliferation of online dating or 'hook-up' platforms, and other factors that shape their sexual lives. Providing more ""knowledge"" to young men might help them engage in risk-reduction practices and bio-technical interventions (e.g., antiretroviral-based prevention strategies, such as PrEP) may provide added technical capacities to reduce risk, but successful and sustainable interventions need to account for evolving implementation contexts. Thus, the proposed study is timely and important because it can help intervention planners to understand today's socio-cultural contexts and their influence on STI/HIV-related risks experienced by today's young men. In the BC context, we are studying three intervention programs designed to reduce young men's STI/HIV risks: (i) the BC Centre for Disease Control's GetCheckedOnline; (ii) YouthCO's Mpowerment YVR; and (iii) the BC Ministry of Health's Provincial Strategy for STI Prevention, Testing and Treatment. The data generated from the proposed study will inform the effective and ethical adaptation and scaling up of these interventions in ways that enhance their capacity to positively affect the sexual health of young men at risk for STI/HIV."

Addiction treatment is a cornerstone of addressing the overdose crisis, and Vancouver is in the process of rapidly expanding its efforts to create a comprehensive addiction treatment system for adolescents and young adults. In 2015, the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority (VCH) issued new clinical guidelines that make Suboxone a recommended first line treatment for opioid use disorders among young people. VCH anticipates the addition of 17 youth dedicated residential addiction treatment beds over the next year. Vancouver is also in the midst of scaling up efforts to coordinate healthcare service delivery for vulnerable, drug using populations through the Downtown Eastside Second Generation Strategy. With these changes, street-involved young people's access to Suboxone, residential treatment beds, and continuity of addiction care promises to reach unprecedented levels. However, many urgent questions remain regarding how to most effectively deliver these interventions, in ways that are congruent with the complex, everyday lived experiences of these young people, as well as those who provide addiction treatment and care to this population. The proposed study will address this knowledge gap by describing street-involved youth's addiction treatment trajectories and outcomes in the context of Vancouver's expanding efforts to address the overdose crisis. Through interviews and ethnographic fieldwork, we will document the evolving experiences of these young people and their service providers, in relation to a transforming system of services in this setting. Our goal is to create new knowledge that will directly inform ongoing efforts to deliver innovative youth addiction treatment services in Vancouver."

Designing and Implementing Cardiovascular Health Promotion Interventions of Natural Resource Industry Occupations in Northern British Columbia,"['Shubair, Mamdouh M']","['Kerr, Julie', 'Patrick, David M', 'Spence, John C']","['Gender Differences', ""Men'S Health"", 'Natural Resource Occupations', 'Nutritional Health', 'Type 2 Diabetes', 'Workplace Health Promotion']",15000.0,257910,"Throughout the life course, men tend to access health care services less frequently than women. Often by the time they do seek medical care, their type 2 diabetes (T2D) or the metabolic syndrome (MetS) conditions would have progressed and are advanced with associated comorbidities (such as hypertension, hyperglycemia, high blood lipids). Furthermore, the life expectancy for northern BC men is shorter than their male counterparts in other urban/suburban regions of Canada (Men's Health Report, 2010). Specifically, workers in the mining, forestry, and commercial transport sectors were responsible for 65% of the total deaths (BC Coroners Service, 2010).
Rationale: Gender as a construct represents the complex interaction of social relations and practices attached to biological sex. It is one of the most important sociocultural factors affecting behavioural lifestyle factors and overall health (Evans, Frank, Oliffe, & Gregory, 2011). While there have been multiple reports and programs focused on Women's health in Canada, there has been no consideration of the equally significant health issues faced by men or the striking differences in morbidity, mortality, and life expectancy, and the underlying determinants of health which give rise to these differences. Men's health is rarely analyzed through the lens of gender despite the fact that a large body of health research indicates that men with comparable social disadvantages as women experience worse health outcomes with respect to injury rates, disability, chronic diseases, and mortality. The purpose of this planning meeting will be to bring together a number of experts (Shubair, Spence, Patrick, Raine) and strategic partners from a variety of stakeholder organizations (NHA, ImpactBC) in order to develop a conceptual framework within which partnerships can operate with relevance to Men's Health in northern BC. We will build upon a series of ongoing research projects and meetings conducted over the past year (2011/2012)."
The Causal Role of Acute Alcohol Consumption in Unprotected Sex among MSM at Risk for Acquiring HIV,"['Shuper, Paul A']",['N/A'],"['Aids', 'Alcohol', 'Condoms', 'Gay And Bisexual Men', 'Hiv', 'Men Who Have Sex With Men (Msm)', 'Prevention', 'Risk', 'Sex', 'Substance Use']",,241812,"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a significant public health concern in Canada, and sexual behaviour remains the primary method through which HIV is transmitted among Canadians. Within this context, the consumption of alcohol is frequently seen as a key driver of unprotected sex. However, the evidence for a direct association between alcohol and unprotected sex tends to be mixed, which not only limits our understanding of alcohol's potential causal role in condom use decisions and subsequent HIV acquisition/transmission, but it also adds complexity to the development of effective behavioural interventions aimed at reducing unprotected sex among at-risk populations. The primary stream of the proposed research program will therefore employ a multi-method approach to investigate alcohol's direct causal and/or indirect interactive impact on high-risk sexual behaviour among gay and bisexual men, who continue to be overrepresented in the Canadian HIV epidemic. Study 1 and Study 2 will employ a unique, alcohol-focused experimental paradigm to assess alcohol's causal role in risky sex intentions among HIV-negative and HIV-positive gay and bisexual men, respectively. Study 3 will consist of a field investigation to identify ""real-world"" linkages between alcohol/substance use and risky sex. Study 4 will build on the findings from these initial studies, and will involve collaborating with clinic- and community-based partners to develop and evaluate an alcohol-focused HIV prevention initiative. A smaller set of complementary initiatives will form the basis of the secondary stream of research, focusing on broader aspects of alcohol, substance use, and HIV prevention. Overall, the proposed program of research could prove to play a key role in future public health initiatives that target the Canadian HIV epidemic on a wide-scale level."

Hazardous alcohol consumption is prevalent in South Africa and has been identified as a key driver of these epidemics. Within South Africa, mineworkers are disproportionately impacted by HIV and TB, and their exceptionally high rates of alcohol use may be hindering HIV and TB prevention and treatment efforts targeted toward this group. While this suggests the need to incorporate alcohol-focused initiatives into HIV and TB programs for mineworkers, sensitivities exist regarding the identification and treatment of alcohol concerns within mining company-administered healthcare settings. As such, meaningful consultation with stakeholders representing diverse factions from the industry would be required prior to developing and evaluating combined alcohol/HIV/TB programs for mineworkers. Our proposed activities will therefore entail a series of meetings with mineworker organizations, mining corporations, and relevant government departments, with the goal of achieving the following objectives: 1) to explore methods of addressing hazardous alcohol consumption among mineworkers that would potentially be acceptable, feasible, and effective; 2) to discuss means through which alcohol reduction initiatives could be incorporated into HIV and TB prevention and treatment efforts for mineworkers; 3) to discuss ways to address the associated negative health impacts of mineworkers' hazardous alcohol consumption, HIV, and TB on partners, family members, and communities; and 4) to disseminate a report of key findings to stakeholders, and to develop a grant application involving a full-scale alcohol, HIV, and TB initiative for mineworkers in South Africa. Overall, this work will raise awareness of alcohol's role in the persistent HIV and TB epidemics among mineworkers, and it will catalyze a future collaborative effort aimed at reducing the burden of HIV and TB among this population."

Although the proportion of HIV cases among MSM 30-39 years old has been decreasing since 1994, the proportion of HIV infections among MSM aged 40 years and older have been increasing since the start of the epidemic. PHAC reports that most research on HIV/AIDS among MSM focuses on their vulnerability and that research on the resilience of MSM against HIV/AIDS is wanting. It also reports that although there are available studies on young MSM and resilience, there is a lack of research done on older MSM. This suggests that resilience of older MSM against HIV/AIDS represents an area that is under-researched.
Scientific literature and historical accounts provide evidence of resilience among MSM, and there has been research undertaken that highlights the challenges and coping strategies of HIV+ older MSM. However, to date, there has been no research done to examine the resilience of both HIV+ and HIV- MSM aged 40 and older against HIV/AIDS. This is the aim of our project; specifically, to examine resources, strengths and protective factors they possess that prevent further HIV transmission and allow them to thrive in a society not ready to meet the needs of a growing number of older MSM and HIV long-term survivors.
We plan to recruit and include MSM aged 40 and older from the community as peer researchers and members of our advisory board so that they can provide us input and feedback during all stages of the research process. After providing them appropriate training, our peer researchers will interview HIV+ and HIV- MSM 40 and older from Ontario to achieve our project's aim. Together, we will analyze our data and share the knowledge and lessons we learn to relevant research and MSM communities through public presentations and accessible print/online materials."

Despite some recent HIV treatment-related successes across the country, Zimbabwean youth who are living with HIV continue to lag far behind their HIV+ adult counterparts with respect to key HIV treatment-related metrics; particularly the attainment of HIV viral suppression. Alcohol, substance use, and mental health concerns such as depression and anxiety may be hindering HIV treatment-related outcomes among Zimbabwean youth living with HIV. While this indicates the need to develop and integrate addictions and mental health interventions into the youth-focused HIV care continuum, the marked economic challenges currently faced by Zimbabwe suggest that such interventions will only be successful if they are designed to be delivered with minimal resources and with sustainability in mind. Recognizing this situation, consultation with stakeholders relevant to the HIV epidemic among Zimbabwean youth, including community members, HIV care providers, and health policy makers, will be imperative for guiding the development of these interventions. This planning grant therefore entails a series of stakeholder meetings to achieve the following objectives: 1) to discuss potentially acceptable and feasible interventions to address alcohol, substance use, and mental health concerns among HIV+ youth in three high HIV prevalence regions of Zimbabwe; 2) to discuss means through which addictions and mental health interventions could be integrated into youth-focused HIV care; and 3) to disseminate a report of key findings to stakeholders, and to develop a grant application involving an alcohol-, substance use-, and/or mental health-focused intervention tailored for HIV+ Zimbabwean youth. This work will bring to the forefront addictions and mental health concerns in relation to the HIV care cascade among Zimbabwean youth, and it will catalyze a collaboration aimed at improving HIV treatment outcomes among this group."

Methamphetamine use is elevated among gbMSM compared to the general population, and it is associated with poor HIV prevention and treatment outcomes. Although interventions have been developed for gbMSM who are actively using methamphetamine, to our knowledge there have been no initiatives aimed at empowering gbMSM in their decisions around INITIATING methamphetamine use. The aims of our community-based initiative are 1) to solicit gbMSM's perceptions regarding social, behavioural, and environmental factors that contribute to the initiation of methamphetamine use, as well as strengths, resiliencies, and supports that potentially empower decisions around initiation; 2) to gain insight from service providers regarding challenges, strengths, resiliencies, and supports that underlie their gbMSM clients' initiation decisions; and 3) using a theoretical framework, to quantitatively assess challenges, strengths, resiliencies, and supports related to gbMSM's decisions to initiate, or refrain from initiating, methamphetamine use. Corresponding activities include 1) qualitative interviews with 20-30 gbMSM who recently initiated methamphetamine use, or who contemplated initiating but chose not to; 2) qualitative interviews with 10-15 providers who deliver services to gbMSM; and 3) a theory-based, quantitative survey with 120 gbMSM who recently initiated, or chose not to initiate, methamphetamine use. Findings will provide key insight regarding social, behavioural and environmental challenges that precipitate methamphetamine initiation; as well as strengths, resiliencies, and supports that facilitate gbMSM in their choices. The knowledge gained will help guide community-based, strengths-focused approaches aimed at empowering gbMSM in their decisions about methamphetamine initiation, which in turn could enhance HIV prevention and treatment outcomes among this community."

Beyond the biological difference between men and women, it is essential to know the sources of gender disparities in HIV/AIDS infection in order to address the HIV epidemic in each country. In an initial study, we found that gender inequalities in HIV infection were attributable to the unequal distribution of risk factors among men and women in Tanzania and to the differential effect of these factors between groups in Kenya and Lesotho. These different patterns may have important implications for policies to reduce gender inequalities in HIV/AIDS across the three countries. This study will identify and understand sources of HIV infection inequality between men and women in 20 sub-Saharan African countries. With this information, additional work will be done to analyze general social and HIV specific policies' impact on gender disparities in HIV/AIDS infections. This knowledge should help understand how policies may be used to reduce HIV/AIDS gender disparities across sub-Saharan African countries.
In Canada, women who come from HIV endemic countries continue to be over-represented and disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS; they represent more than half (54.2%) of the positive HIV test reports attributed to women. Knowing the causes of gender disparity in HIV infection and the effectiveness of public policies for ameliorating those differences in countries where HIV is endemic could provide important, cost-effective public health benefits for recipient countries such as Canada. Reducing the extent of HIV/AIDS in low-resource, HIV endemic countries, in addition to contributing to global good, could reduce the stress on resources and Canada's health care system due to HIV/AIDS"
Exploring the Support Networks of Caregivers of Persons Living with Stroke (PLWS),"['Sibalija, Jovana']",['N/A'],['Summer Program In Aging'],455.0,476348,"Stroke is the main cause of adult disability in Canada with approximately 75% of persons living with stroke (PLWS) in Canada having some type of disability or impairment. Family caregivers play an important role in stroke recovery as they provide most of the assistance a PLWS receives at home. However, research demonstrates that caring for a PLWS can impact caregivers' lives and wellbeing. The social consequences of stroke caregiving (e.g. marital strain, loneliness) are especially concerning because social relationships can affect well-being. Social support is an important resource for managing caregiving stressors. Social networks play a crucial role in the provision of social support because the connections within a network represent access to social support. However, examinations into the role of support networks during stroke caregiving are limited. The purpose of this study is to examine how caregivers of PLWS access and navigate their social networks and engage in exchanges of social support. Ethnographic methods consisting of interviews, a contact diary, and social network mapping will be used. The study findings will provide insight into how stroke caregivers' social networks were affected by caregiving, how caregivers access support within their networks and how social support influences the stroke caregiving experience. Information on my interest in aging and the SPA theme and my proposed career path is also included."
Towards a More Inclusive Framework for Public and Patient Involvement in Health Research: A Trauma-Informed Intersectional Approach,"['Sibley, Kathryn M', 'Shimmin, Carolyn A']","['Wittmeier, Kristy D']","['Consensus Methodology', 'First Nations', 'Focus Groups', 'Immigrant And Refugee', 'Intersectionality', 'Inuit', 'Mental Health', 'Metis', 'Patient Engagement', 'Theoretical Framework', 'Under-Served Populations']",15000.0,340508,"Current guidelines for involving the public in health research provide a basis for engagement. However, our ongoing work with Manitoba patients, families, and community members has identified a concerning gap in the involvement of patients in health research - the voices of those who are traditionally less heard in health research, such as Indigenous peoples, those living with mental illness and new Canadians. We have developed the Valuing all Voices Framework that builds on the current guidelines by adding specific principles for engaging all Canadians in health research. This framework is based on theories of intersectionality (the complex interactions of social categories like race, class, and gender, to name only a few), experiences of trauma (such as violence or loss), and reflexivity (self-awareness) and comprises four key principles: trust, self-awareness, empathy; and relationship building. The purpose of this project is to review and finalize the framework with people who represent under-represented, hard-to-reach communities. We will hold consultation sessions with people who represent diverse perspective from five communities which include the mental health community; immigrant and refugee community; and First Nations; MÃ©tis; and Inuit communities. In these sessions stakeholders will discuss and vote on the importance of each part of the framework and provide suggestions for additional issues that should be considered. A structured process will be used for compiling the votes and feedback and deciding which components should be included in the final version. Key elements of this proposal include an integrated approach that involves stakeholders at all stages of the project, including a patient co-researcher who brings lived experience to the role. This project will result in a new set of guidelines that will then be used by health researchers in developing tools and strategies for authentic and meaningful public engagement."

While most adolescents recover within 4 weeks, approximately 15-30% can remain symptomatic for months. The most consistent predictor of delayed recovery is severity of an individual's acute symptoms following injury. Headache, dizziness, and neck pain are common symptoms reported following concussion and may be related to changes in cervical spine, vestibular, oculomotor, and balance function. Recently, there has been a greater research focus on cervical, vestibular, oculomotor, and balance systems acutely post-concussion as predictors of recovery. However, limitations exist as most studies evaluate these systems on their own and do not consider established risk factors for delayed recovery. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of cervical spine, vestibular-ocular, oculomotor, and balance dysfunction as predictors of delayed recovery. This is a sub-study in a national cohort study (SHRed Concussions - Surveillance in High Schools to Reduce the Risk of Concussions and its Consequences [Primary Investigator: C Emery]). Adolescents, aged 10-18, participating in high school or community sport, were invited to participate. When a participant sustains a suspected concussion, they are assessed by a sport medicine physician within 72 hours and a multifaceted standardized assessment evaluating cervical spine, vestibular, oculomotor, and balance function is completed. Participants will continue to follow up with the physician until medically cleared to return to play (RTP) following concussion Establishing modifiable clinical factors that elevate the risk for persistent post-concussion symptoms will have important health implications, providing support for clinicians in determining appropriate treatment plans, as well as counseling and education for parents and youth athletes."

Individuals hospitalized for a suicide attempt are generally going through a severe crisis and are more likely to eventually die by suicide. Those who have experienced emotional and behavioural problems (e.g., anxiety, depression, social withdrawal, opposition, and aggression) as a child are more susceptible to attempt suicide later in life. However, hospitalizations for suicide attempts by people who had emotional and behavioural problems during childhood are currently undocumented. Yet, this information could help to better support children with these emotional and behavioural problems, better plan healthcare services to respond to their needs, and improve their lifelong development. We have two main objectives. First, to identify lifetime hospitalizations for suicide attempts among individuals with childhood emotional and behavioural problems and compare differences between males and females with and without childhood emotional and behavioural problems. Second, with a subgroup of the 250 most disruptive boys, we will test whether an early intervention offered in grades 1 and 2 in the 1980s reduced the use of healthcare services for psychiatric reasons when these boys reached their forties. To achieve these goals, we will use government healthcare data from 6438 adults who were followed since kindergarten in 1984 (1037 boys) and in 1987 (5401 boys and girls). The emotional and behavioural problems of these same individuals were assessed by their teachers from ages 6 to 12. This study will allow us to recommend tangible interventions for children with emotional and behavioural problems to improve their life course, decrease their risk of serious suicidal behaviours leading to hospitalizations, and contribute to reducing the strain on the healthcare system."

Unemployment Benefits Policies and Their Consequences for Health Equity,"['Siddiqi, Arjumand']",['N/A'],"['Canada', 'Health Equity', 'Oecd', 'Policy Interventions', 'Social Policy', 'Unemployment']",,297813,"We live in economically uncertain times.  Large numbers of people in Canada and in countries to which Canada is strongly tied face employment insecurity, experiencing either unemployment, underemployment, or unstable employment. Many of those insecurely attached to jobs also fall into otherwise economically vulnerable groups, those with low levels of education, immigrants, and visible minorities, while other groups at higher risk for job insecurity have also begun to be identified, such as young adults, especially young and visible minority men, for whom unemployment is now a major stated problem.  High levels of such employment insecurity create a major source of health inequities in Canada and its peer nations.  At the same time that employment insecurity has been rising, policies to buffer its adverse economic and social consequences, which are the main reasons for its health equity consequences, have been changing. What unemployment policy interventions of federal and provincial governments reduce the level of employment-based inequities in health? Are the effects of unemployment policy interventions on employment-based health inequities different for various subgroups?
At the same time that more evidence is needed on the effects of unemployment policies on population level health inequities, local public health institutions, who are closer to the on-the-ground, everyday lived experiences of citizens are working in various ways to develop their own real-time strategies for achieving health equity.  How have local public health institutions experienced and developed responses for health equity in the context of unemployment policies enacted at broader levels of society? The overall objective of the proposed program of research is to engage and work with major policy-oriented decision makers to produce evidence on how employment benefit policies affect health equity and how localities respond to these challenges."

These forms of social status are commonly referred to as social determinants, and they play a role in many pathways that influence the risk of a broad range of health outcomes  - those involving behaviors, culture, biology, and the use of health services.  Race/ethnicity is a particularly strong and pervasive social determinant of health.  The association between race/ethnicity and health outcomes is thought to be the results of inequities (i.e., unjustly uneven distribution) across race/ethnic groups of the basic health resources (income, education, and health care) required for a healthy life.  On the other hand, recent studies are starting to suggest that, among economically advanced countries, the extent of race/ethnic inequalities in health differs.  However, evidence on race/ethnic health inequalities in Canada is still quite sparse.  Moreover, the potential reasons for cross-national differences have also not been explored in any depth. 

In the present study we contribute to the literature in several ways.  We use nationally representative survey data to inequalities in health between specific race/ethnic groups in Canada, including First Nations groups. We also investigate for the Canadian context whether race/ethnic inequalities in health are associated with race/ethnic inequalities in basic health resources.  Finally, we will compare our findings with a nationally representative sample from the United States and will conduct a comparative case study to assess whether differences in the macro-environment of these two countries - economic, policy, and social - can help to explain cross-national differences in race/ethnic inequalities of health and race/ethnic inequities in health resources."

We are starting to learn that people with lower incomes are experiencing more opioid issues than people with higher incomes.  This means that not only is there an opioid crisis, but that disadvantaged Canadians are unfairly bearing the largest burden of it.  At the same time, we are also learning that new technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), can help us to do a better job of understanding why this is happening.  It can provide high-quality answers to the following types of questions. Who are the Canadians most likely to be affected by the crisis? Where in Canada is the crisis the worst? Why are some people and places experiencing more of the crisis than others? It is important to get good quality answers to these questions so that we can develop the best possible solutions to the opioid crisis.  But, in order to do this research well, we have to be systematic about it. We have to understand what 'data' (information) is available to help us answer these questions. We have to understand what the logistical considerations are for applying AI to this data.  This proposal provides these understandings.  It includes reviewing the scientific literature, to see how other health researchers have applied AI.  It also includes an assessment of the data we have in Canada, and the possibilities and constraints of applying AI techniques to this data.  Finally, it involves locating the best scientific collaborators and other partners with whom we can enter into long-term relationships to accomplish this research and to make sure it is communicated to people who can use the information to help Canadians overcome this tremendous problem."

Research suggests that it isn't enough to only study how income and other forms of 'socioeconomic status' are related to health.  Similarly, studying the health of immigrants as one big group, or even lumping all non-white immigrants together, as is done when we examine 'visible minorities' versus whites, is also inadequate for understanding inequities in the health of Canadians.  We need to treat race/ethnicity and its relationship to health in far more nuanced ways.  Currently, we have very little Canadian evidence on race/ethnic health inequities, and the Federal Government of Canada is clamouring for this evidence.  This proposal will use Statistics Canada data to produce this evidence.  We aim to: (a) determine the extent of inequities (differences) in chances of dying across race/ethnic groups in Canada; (b) determine whether inequities in chances of dying are further influenced by other social and economic characteristics, such as gender and income.  We are a team that is diverse in terms of gender, race/ethnicity, and the intersections thereof.  We bring a lot of scientific expertise and experience in engaging government and civil society organizations on matters of race/ethnicity and health.  Public Health Agency of Canada and the National Collaborating Center on Determinants of Health has endorsed our project, and we will work with them and other organizations to communicate our findings to a wide audience.

The COVID-19 pandemic has compounded this issue, as poor IAQ can result in increased transmission. In addition, public health authorities in Ontario have not provided congregate settings with evidence-based COVID-19 IAQ guidance. The current situation has further exacerbated existing disparities and forced users, workers, and operators to make difficult decisions between receiving/providing essential services and increased risk of infection. The proposed effort addresses the lack of guidance by bringing together a multidisciplinary team of researchers and knowledge translators in partnership with a variety of agencies and individuals that operate and work in community congregate settings. Together, we will build pandemic preparedness and response capacity in the community setting in Toronto through the provision of accessible and practical IAQ guidance to reduce exposure and mitigate transmission. This guidance will address the diversity of buildings and services in the community setting, while taking into account the diversity of perspectives and power dynamics that occur across sectors and in facilities. Specific activities include developing a series of webinars; preparing evidence-based plain language IAQ guidance; authoring high-impact interdisciplinary opinion/editorial articles; training of highly qualified personnel to develop and share IAQ COVID-19 mitigation measures, and the development of a research proposal to address gaps in the evaluation, impact, and implementation of mitigation strategies. Through the process of bringing multidisciplinary researchers, community organizations and workers together, we will build a robust interdisciplinary community of research and practice to address IAQ pandemic preparedness and response in these essential spaces."

Prevention of lung cancer depends on the discovery and elimination of its causes. Each cancer case results from the conjuncture of a complex of circumstances (e.g., genetic predisposition, environmental exposures, lifestyle habits) which combine over a lifetime to initiate cancers. Cigarette smoking is the single most important cause of lung cancer. Since it has proven so hard to eliminate smoking, it is very important to identify other modifiable causes. Apart from smoking, there are several recognized or suspected lung carcinogens in the occupational milieu and there are several suspected non-occupational risk factors as well, such as alcohol intake, domestic radon, and urban air pollution. In 1996 we undertook a large study of lung cancer whose aim was to elucidate environmental causes of lung cancer. All lung cancer cases occurring in Montreal from 1996 to 1998 were approached, as well as a representative sample of people in the general population.  Interviews were carried out with 1211 cases and 1539 controls. The questionnaire focused on lifetime occupational history, but also included detailed info on many other factors.  The occupational history was subsequently evaluated to infer a list of occupational exposures. The statistical challenge is to compare the cases with the controls to determine which factors, if any, occurred more often among cases than among controls, and that might be causally related to lung cancer. This is a lengthy and painstaking process. We have started working our way through the long list of about 600 different variables at our disposal, and this has resulted in a number of results and publications. The purpose of the present application is to extend the comprehensive program of statistical analysis and reporting of this study.

These plans generally focus on what steps to take to prevent the spread of an influenza virus, and what to do when the influenza reaches epidemic and pandemic levels.  The moral questions and values that guide PIPP focus on issues such as the just allocation of scarce resources, the duties of healthcare practitioners, and the restriction of persons' liberties.  However, to date, minimal attention has been given regarding the responsibilities of healthcare systems and organizations toward vulnerable populations, especially the mentally ill and homeless, during a pandemic.  The mentally ill and homeless, who are normally marginalized within healthcare systems due to socio-economic factors and stigmatization, will face further hardships during a pandemic unless their needs are specifically addressed in PPP.

However, there are significant limitations in our knowledge of hate/bias-related violence and discrimination among youth in Canada, impacts on mental health, and how youth cope and build resilience. Centering youth voices through meaningful engagement in research and knowledge mobilization is critical to understanding youth experiences of and resilience to hate/bias-related violence and discrimination, and to developing prevention and intervention strategies that meet the needs of diverse youth in Canada. The overall goal of the study is to use a youth-led participatory action research approach and an intersectional lens to examine how youth experiences of violence and discrimination in Hamilton, Ontario contribute to and perpetuate health inequities, so as to inform development of youth-centred policies and programs. Specific objectives are to:
1.Examine the nature and characteristics of hate/bias-related violence and discrimination involving youth, including types of hate/bias (e.g. racism, heterosexism, xenophobia), manifestations of hate/bias (e.g. structural and interpersonal), and settings where youth experience hate/bias (e.g. school, public spaces, online).
2.Understand the pathways through which hate/bias-related violence and discrimination influences youth mental health, including how youth cope and build resilience. 
3.Identify strategies for preventing and mitigating impacts of youth exposure to hate/bias-related violence and discrimination on mental health.
Through our partnership with the HamOnt Youth Steering Committee at the City of Hamilton and community agencies, our project will contribute to evidence on youth experiences and mental health impacts of hate/bias-related violence and discrimination as well as build youth capacity in research and knowledge mobilization."

Stomach Cancer Trends in the North American Arctic,"['Simkin, Jonathan']",['N/A'],"['Cancer Epidemiology', 'Cancer Incidence', 'Cancer Mortality', 'Cancer Survival', 'Circumpolar Health', 'Health Equity', 'Indigenous Health', 'Population Health', 'Prevention & Cancer Control', 'Stomach Cancer']",105000.0,387261,"Problem: Stomach cancer is the fifth most commonly diagnosed cancer world-wide and the third most common causing death. While declining in Canada and the United States, the burden is not shared equally. Arctic and Indigenous populations have been shown to have elevated rates of stomach cancer but up-to-date rates across the Arctic and among Indigenous People in Canada are incompletely described and differences with national and non-Indigenous counterparts have not been thoroughly examined. This gap is a significant barrier to evidence-based decision making. 

Vision: There is an urgent need to examine stomach cancer trends in Canada's Arctic and among Indigenous Peoples in Canada to understand geographic patterns, identify potential causes and inform cancer control priorities. Using this data, we can reverse the evidence-deficit, eliminate disparities, and create a more inclusive and forward-looking evidence-based system for all Canadians. 

Aims: I plan to calculate and compare rates of new cases, mortality, and survival for stomach cancer among Arctic populations to southern provincial and national comparators, and Indigenous rates to non-Indigenous counterparts using data from population-based cancer registries.

Significance: Despite a universal healthcare system in Canada, Arctic populations and Indigenous Peoples are at a disadvantage. Cancer-specific information is limited for Arctic and Indigenous populations and this gap is a significant barrier to evidence-based decision making. This is the first Pan-Arctic cancer-focused analysis. This project is supported by a network of Arctic Territorial and State, Provincial and Indigenous health authorities enabling a statistically and culturally meaningful examination of trends to address regional cancer control priorities and eliminate disparities. Further, this project has the potential to be applied to Arctic regions globally."

In addition to the potentially elevated contaminant exposure, Northern Indigenous groups face higher rates of food insecurity and inadequate nutrient intakes. The aim of the proposed project is to assess food security and to increase resilience to climate change in the region. To do so, the project will be divided in two components. First, nutrients will be measured in blood samples already collected from participants and then compared to deficiency thresholds. These results will be used to identify the most vulnerable groups in the region and investigate the role of country foods in preventing food insecurity. Each participant will receive his or her individual results. In parallel, the knowledge users will document the food security issue in the community using a semi-quantitative survey. Secondly, the conclusions will be shared with the community delegates during a five-day workshop at University of Waterloo with the involvement of community and academic researchers and knowledge users in food security, food systems and nutrition. A two-way knowledge exchange will be conducted to strengthen academic and indigenous capacity building for the benefit of all. The community researchers/knowledge users will then have the resources to share these findings with the communities and engage community members in brainstorming on food security challenges and opportunities. An approach of de-stigmatisation and openness will be adopted, while collecting key ideas on potential local and regional mitigation strategies related to climate change. This project will support discussions within the community about the challenges to food security, climate change, and possibilities to increase resilience in the region."
The Value of the Community Readiness Model Tool for First Nations Diabetes Prevention and Care Planning,"['Simmons, Rachel A']",['N/A'],"['Community Readiness', 'Diabetes Type 2', 'First Nations Health', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Mobilization']",1500.0,331192,"Context: Chronic disease, such as type 2 diabetes, is a large concern for public health within developed nations, especially in First Nations communities, where rates are much higher than in non-Native populations. Successful interventions are always well tailored to their context, and participatory rural appraisal methods aid in this process of adaptation. Community readiness is one example of how knowledge about the community landscape and context is created.  Despite the accessibility of this knowledge, there has been a large hurdle in implementing successful and sustainable programs and activities at the community level. Knowledge mobilization and knowledge translation strategies have the potential to increase mobilization within communities for prevention activities. 
Objective:Â To better understand the role of a research-developed tool for knowledge mobilization processes in First Nations communities. Of special interest is how the adapted CRM creates knowledge that can then be translated to action from the perspective of lay First Nations community members.
Human Subjects Review: This study was approved by the IRB of McGill University and the University of Western Ontario.
Design: Qualitative descriptive study based of focus group discussion.
Setting: 6 First Nations communities recruited within Wave 1 of the FORGE-AHEAD research  program. 
Participants: All community members who attended an 'Action Planning' workshop as part of the FORGE-AHEAD project were asked to participate. 
Results: Participants discussed the usefulness of the CRM tool around the following themes: key informants, community context, structure and organization of the tool, and mobilization using the Knowledge to Action framework (Graham et. al.). 
Conclusions: With a few adaptations to better suit the way First Nations communities are organized, the community readiness tool has the potential to encourage mobilization around diabetes prevention and care."
Community Mobilization and the Community Readiness Model Tool for Diabetes Prevention: a case study within selected First Nations Communities in Canada,"['Simmons, Rachel A']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Award'],1500.0,311437,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a large burden on the healthcare system, as it uses many resources and affects all major organ systems of an individual. In First Nations communities in Canada, rates of diabetes are much higher than in non-native populations, and though interventions have been proposed and been in place for years, incidence keeps rising. Community mobilization is necessary for interventions to succeed in the long-term; currently many mobilization processes are poorly understood and conducted. In order to better understand why community mobilization succeeds or fails, we will examine the use of the Community Readiness Model tool within the Transformation of Indigenous Primary Healthcare Delivery (FORGE-AHEAD) project (PI: SB Harris, UWO). 

Objectives: 1) To understand what a community needs to mobilize around diabetes prevention. 2) To determine what the Community Readiness Model tool contributes to the process of community mobilization.

This will be a case-study comprised of qualitative interviews and observations, examined through content analysis. Data collection will occur in a First Nations community recruited within the FORGE-AHEAD project. All community members who responded to the CRM tool survey will be invited to participate. 

We will learn whether a formal tool is helpful to advance community mobilization, and what helps and impedes mobilization processes for improved health interventions. Though this project focuses on diabetes in indigenous communities, it has further application for health interventions in any community setting. It will provide practical information about future intervention planning and implementation, to increase the likelihood of success."

Low breastfeeding rates are of concern in Nova Scotia, particularly among mothers from nutritionally vulnerable (food insecure) households. High poverty may partially account for Nova Scotia's
low breastfeeding rates but maternal obesity (a possible issue among food insecure mothers) is on the rise in Nova Scotia and being obese can also affect one's ability to successfully breastfeed. We know little about the experience of breastfeeding from the perspectives of obese women and more specifically, obese women who are also low income
and food insecure. By exploring breastfeeding practice among women sharing these multiple realities, this research will fill a critical void in our understanding of how we might improve breastfeeding in this demographic. This research aligns with both national and regional research priorities on obesity and the social determinants of health, as well as
supporting Canada's recent reaffirmation of improving maternal and child health across the globe - of which improving (exclusive) breastfeeding behaviour among all mothers is a priority."

Video is one strategy to effectively communicate the complexity of mobility issues confronting older adults as they grow old in their communities. Through knowledge sharing and multi-sector collaborations we seek to develop an innovative documentary style video that demonstrates, through the 'eyes' of an older adult, features of the built environment that facilitate or impede mobility and physical activity.  For this planning grant, we bring together two teams ('Walk the Talk' and 'Active Streets, Active People') whose collective goal is to promote and enable the health and mobility of older adults. Planning grant funds would be dedicated to developing a video (our final KT product) which includes finalizing its content, production and supporting its widespread presentation and dissemination to key stakeholders.

Despite this, only 11% of Canadian older adults are active enough to enjoy health benefits. To positively affect the health of populations, physical activity programs that demonstrate effectiveness on a small scale must be scaled-up to reach diverse populations across a variety of settings. With BC Ministry of Health, we designed and implemented a community-, choice-based, 6-month health promoting intervention for older adults called Choose to Move (CTM). We called upon the science of implementation as a guide to effectively implement CTM at larger scale-- in 26 communities across BC. CTM improved physical activity, mobility, social connectedness and decreased loneliness in community-dwelling older adults (n=458). As a next step, we aim to scale-up CTM to target older adults at greater risk - those in receipt of home and community care services. Home and community care services are a lifeline for older adults in BC (and across Canada), many of whom are unable to perform activities of daily living. Thus, we propose to 'reimagine' home and community care services to integrate strategies that support the physical and social well-being of older adults who wish to stay at home. To do so we will convene established and new partners to adapt CTM and co-create an action plan to reach older adults in receipt of home and community care services.

Our objectives for this operating grant are threefold. First, we will adapt the CTM intervention and implementation strategies to 'fit' the home and community care context. Second, we will adapt the current CTM implementation/scale-up action and evaluation plans for the home and community care context. Third, we will describe the CTM adaptation process. What we learn in BC can be applied to scale-up of health promoting interventions across Canada and the world."

Physical activity (PA) enhances mental and physical health and decreases prevalence of chronic disease in older adults. Still, older adults are among the most sedentary Canadians - 85% fail to meet PA guidelines. This reality is a call to action. 

To answer this call we partnered with the British Columbia (BC) Ministry of Health and community partners to co-create a novel physical activity intervention (Choose to Move (CTM)) and to assess the most effective way to implement CTM in the community. For CTM, activity coaches provide older adults one-on-one assistance to develop action plans for PA, opportunities to connect with other participants and motivation and support to sustain their PA program. After our pilot testing, we are now ready to begin the MOH-funded implementation of CTM across BC. This provides a unique opportunity to conduct research into program effectiveness and factors that influence implementation. 

Therefore our overall research goals are to assess: 1) whether CTM increases PA and increases social connectedness of older adults (Part 1 - Impact evaluation), and 2) factors that help or hinder implementation of CTM across BC (Part 2 - Implementation evaluation). To achieve these goals we will implement CTM in BC Recreation and Parks Association (BCRPA) facilities (rec centres) and YMCA locations across BC (1620 participants).  

We build upon a history of collaboration among a core team of junior and more senior health researchers who have expertise working with older adults, physical activity and translating research findings into action. Our team is also strengthened by established partnerships with BCRPA, YMCA and United Way of the Lower Mainland who have capacity to sustain and extend the reach of this project and our findings across BC and Canada."
Availability of Healthy Food Options in the Surrounding School Environment and Diet Quality of School-Aged Children: Findings from a Provincially Representative Study of Grade 5 Students from Alberta,"['Sim, Shannon M']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,400520,"In Canada, childhood overweight and obesity is a major public health challenge. Approximately 1.6 million or one-third of Canadian children and youth are overweight or obese. There is an opportunity to prevent obesity and reduce the future chronic disease burden by fostering healthy eating habits from an early age. Yet, the overwhelming majority of Canadian children do not have healthy eating habits. Researchers have suggested that children's eating habits are influenced by the food environments that surround them. Recent studies have found that being exposed to unhealthy food environments, such as convenience stores and fast-food outlets in a neighbourhood, is linked to poor eating habits and a higher likelihood of being obese. However, little is known about the relationship between unhealthy food environments, healthy eating habits and body weights in school-aged children. This study used data from Raising healthy Eating and Active Living Kids Alberta (REAL Kids Alberta), population-based study of grade 5 students in Alberta, Canada, to examine how unhealthy food environments impact children's diet and body weights. Of the 989 school-aged students who participated in the study, 40% were classified as overweight or obese. On average, participants reported consuming foods from a variety of food groups, but overall had relatively low diet quality. Further analysis if currently under investigation. This research will provide important evidence to guide future obesity prevention efforts to support school-aged Canadian children in having healthy eating habits and body weights."

Our objective was to analyze relationships between psychosocial stress and distress with sedentary behavior among pregnant women in Canada. MÃ©thode: We analyzed objectively-measured sedentary behavior at 16-18, 24-26 and 32-24 weeks gestation in a sociodemographically diverse cohort of 70 women in Montreal Canada. Participants completed the Perceived Stress Questionnaire, and wore an accelerometer for 3 days that quantified sitting time. We used univariate general linear models to analyze relationships between perceived stress and sedentary behavior at each evaluation period. To assess generalizability, we analyzed relationships between psychological distress with self-reported leisure-time sedentary behavior among a sample representative of 166,095 women in the Canadian Community Health Survey.  RÃ©sultats et analyse: We observed positive association between perceived stress and sitting time in the Montreal cohort, with small to moderate effect sizes (partial n2=0.08-0.16).

The spiritual way of life includes speaking the language, connection to land and water and participating in ceremonies that support wellness across the lifespan. 
The long history of colonial practices in this country has disrupted the traditional lifeways of nations, including the transmission of birth knowledge and practices. The project will seek to answer the question, How do cultural, spiritual, land-based and community connections from the time of birth impact the health and wellness of our children as defined by our nations?

     The purpose of this pilot study is to better understand how an older person's formal and informal supports (family, friends, home care etc) help or hinder their recovery following a fall. We will recruit approximately 20 people aged 65 and over living in the City of Hamilton who have fallen and visited an emergency department. At one month and three months following the fall we will interview them about their experiences of formal and informal support as it relates to their abilities and autonomy in home and community activities.

Cultural humility means that health providers recognize and reflect on power differences in interactions with their clients. Cultural safety is created by health providers recognizing their personal biases and assumptions. Adopting cultural humility and cultural safety means health providers can reduce power differences with clients and give better care. However, what these concepts look like in practice is unclear. We have built this first-ever scoping review with health providers, educators and researchers to explain cultural humility and cultural safety and what they 'look like' in communication between providers and clients. We will look at published literature to understand how they describe these concepts. After this, we will hold group meetings with 30 health providers to get their feedback on our findings. We will also ask them to share their thoughts on how health providers could apply cultural humility and cultural safety in their practice. Finally, we will share these results in different ways with key people, such as health researchers, organizations and providers so that they can use them."
Risk of Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer among individuals with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: A population-based study,"['Singh, Harminder', 'Bernstein, Charles N', 'Demers, Alain']",['N/A'],"['Inflammatory Bowel Disease', 'Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer', 'Population-Based Study']",37372.0,207383,"As compared to the rest of the world, the burden of inflammatory bowel disease is among the highest in Canada. Non-melanoma skin cancer is the commonest cancer in Canada. People with suppression of their immune system, such as those with organ transplants have an increased risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancer. Therefore individuals with organ transplants are recommended to have their skin examined regularly for skin cancers. The immune system is also altered in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease, especially among those treated with drugs which suppress the immune system. While the immune system suppression in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease is generally less than that in those with organ transplants, inflammatory bowel disease patients may still be at risk for skin cancers. The true risk of non-melanoma skin cancer in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease remains unknown.

In this study, we will determine the risk of non-melanoma skin cancer in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease as compared to that in similar age and gender individuals in the general population. We will also determine the impact of treatment with immune system suppressing drugs in individuals with inflammatory bowel disease,on the risk of non-melanoma skins cancers. 

Our results will help develop recommendations for follow-up of individuals with inflammatory bowel disease to reduce their risk of having undiagnosed non-melanoma skin cancer."

A particular dimension that is under-explored and researched is the impact that infectious outbreaks have on the risk perception of cancer patients, including those who are at increased risk of developing infections due to their treatments and immunocompromised state. Furthermore, in the era of continuous and rapid news reporting, social media, and messaging platforms, the proliferation and distribution of COVID-2019 content is unprecedented and further driving distress among this group of patients and caregivers who need to visit medical instituions at regular intervals. At Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center Odette Cancer Center in Toronto, Ontario, we have seen an unprecedented number of clinic appointment cancellations due to fears of being exposed to COVID-2019 given we were the first Canadian institution to confirm a patient infected with COVID-2019. Therefore, to better understand this phenomenon, we have designed a research proposal to address this under explored area in order to develop educational tools to help patients and their families/caregivers make informed decisions based on the true risks during this outbreak with appropriate levels of concern and mitigation. We expect these education interventions to empower patients and families/caregivers on the true risks of COVID-2019 infection and in turn prevent inappropriate clinic cancellations and sub-optimal care for patients undergoing treatment for cancer."

In this study, we would like to understand whether suicide risks among different age groups and sex are higher in more disadvantaged areas in Ontario, and what types of community-level disadvantages are related to suicide. We will also identify suicide clusters in Ontario and examine whether the location of suicide clusters changes over time. Lastly, we will examine the differences in area-level characteristics (unemployment, poverty, social segregation, etc.) between suicide clusters and other areas in Ontario, and whether the profile of suicide cases within and outside the clusters are similar or not.

The results will help us identify high-risk areas and understand the needs of these communities. The findings will help different stakeholders such as policymakers to design specific intervention strategies accordingly."

The industry appears to describe companies' efforts as justified if: (i) they are producing or communicating sound science; (ii) they are acting according to established protocols; (iii) they are engaging in strategically important or unavoidable practices within their business contexts; or (iv) they are promoting health or meeting patient desires. The first goal of the project is to describe these justifications systematically. This research will draw much of its data from conferences and workshops catering to different parts of the pharmaceutical industry, and trade publications.

It is not hard to argue that the manipulation of research and publication, as well as the promotion of preferred industry messages via other routes, presents serious ethical problems. Thus a second goal of the project is to provide analysis of the relations between the above justifications and broader ethical considerations. Considerations from normative ethics will likely show deep problems with the pharmaceutical industry's self-justifications."

Men and Women's Faulty Perceptions of New Sex Partner Safety: Trusting What is Superficially Familiar.,"['Skakoon-Sparling, Shayna P']",['N/A'],"['Gender Differences', 'Partner Familiarity', 'Sexual Risk Taking']",1321.0,331774,"It is essential that we gain a clearer understanding of why young Canadians fail to appropriately protect themselves from STI/HIV transmission. Partner familiarity plays an important role in judgements of partner safety; however, much research has focused on retrospective analyses and/or conflates new/casual partners with unfamiliar partners.  It is essential that a clear distinction be made between familiar and unfamiliar new partners when examining sexual risk-taking. The current study examined the impact of new partner familiarity on perceptions of partner appeal and STI transmission risk. Participants (N= 83, female= 53) were presented with eight different vignettes and judged the hypothetical partners presented in each (e.g. appeal as a sexual partner, trustworthiness, STI transmission risk, etc.). Participants reported a significantly greater interest in forming a long-term relationship with familiar partners (t(82) = 14.18, p < .01), rated them as more appealing sexual partners (t(80) = 11.74, p < .01), and were more interested in having unprotected sex with them (t(79) = 9.97, p < .01). Unfamiliar partners were perceived as posing a significantly greater risk for STI transmission (t(81) = 8.71, p < .01). Compared to women, men were less sensitive to the risks posed by the unfamiliar new partners, while women rated these as posing significantly a greater threat (e.g., less trustworthy, less appeal as a sex partner, greater STI transmission risk). The results of this analysis offer insight into how men and women may differ in their judgements of the risks associated with unprotected sex with familiar and unfamiliar new partners, as well as how these gender differences may impact sexual risk-taking behaviour. The practical implications of these findings for sexual education as well as future research of sexual risk taking will be discussed."

"""Not the condom police"": Challenges and strategies for Ontario outreach workers talking about HIV transmission risk.","['Skakoon-Sparling, Shayna P']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1369.0,368268,"Communication of risk is essential to end HIV transmission. Outreach workers are instrumental to directly inform those most at risk. Communication can be made less effective due to low health literacy levels, and stigma can increase the challenge of effective HIV risk communication. In order to surmount these obstacles, it is essential to understand the most effective means to communicate HIV risk and to explore the challenges outreach workers face.

Literature reviews of HIV risk communication articles were conducted examining effective interventions for communicating effectively about HIV. Focus groups were conducted with outreach workers (N = 20) who work with at-risk populations in Ontario, including: gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM); street involved people; people who inject drugs (PWID); African, Caribbean, and Black (ACB) communities; indigenous groups, and women. Audio recordings from focus groups were transcribed and a thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo. 
 
The literature review highlighted the importance of providing information that contextualizes HIV risk. For instance, information about the causes and consequences of HIV creates a sense of personal relevance which makes risk information easier for clients to remember and understand. Analysis of focus group data revealed that one of the more effective strategies outreach workers employ is using their language and tone to create judgement-free spaces that work to build trust and comfort in their clients. However, outreach workers may need training to assess the needs of their clients, including diverse strategies to communicate effectively with clients who do not understand the outreach workers' initial approach.
 
The results provide unique insights into the communication of HIV risk conducted by outreach workers in Ontario: the challenges, the successes, and the opportunities for improvements. These findings will help inform policy and future program planning."
The impact of loneliness on sexual behaviour among sexual minority men in Canada.,"['Skakoon-Sparling, Shayna P']",['N/A'],"['Determinants Of Health', 'Hiv', ""Men'S Health"", 'Sexual Health', 'Sexual Minority Men', 'Sexual Risk Behaviour', 'Sexually Transmitted Infections']",135000.0,417552,"Members of sexual minority groups, which include gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBM), experience homophobic stigma. This can lead to internalized homophobia and identity related stress, which are closely linked with difficulty forming social connections and fewer social supports. This leads, in turn, to increased loneliness. Among GBM, loneliness is associated with behaviours that increase risk for STIs/HIV (e.g., substance use and compulsive partner seeking). This likely contributes to the fact that GBM remain at more than 71 times greater risk for HIV compared to other men. Maladaptive coping strategies for loneliness, like substance use and hypersexual behaviour, not only increase an individual's risk for STI/HIV infection, but can impair and interfere with the development and maintenance of positive social relationships, leading to only fleeting relief from the symptoms of loneliness and isolation.
There are two types of loneliness: emotional loneliness (longing for a partner or a close confidant) and social loneliness (longing for a larger social network). However, the distinct impact of these two types is loneliness among GBM is not yet understood. It is also unknown whether GBM who experience loneliness may be using other means to protect themselves when engaging in ostensibly risky sex (i.e., condomless anal sex with multiple partners). Understanding more specifically how loneliness may be associated with risky sex, as well as with the uptake and adherence of biomedical HIV prevention (i.e., using HIV medications to prevent transmission) is another key component to developing effective STI/HIV prevention. Thus, the aims of my proposed project are to (1) understand which types of loneliness (emotional vs. social) are more important for STI/HIV risk and prevention behaviours among GBM. (2) Investigate whether biomedical HIV prevention plays a mitigating role in GBM's loneliness-related sexual risk taking."

Historically, the entire way of life for Aboriginal people revolved around their food source, self-sustenance, and a subsistence livelihood. However, in recent decades, Aboriginal populations living in northern communities have been increasingly vulnerable to the transformation of local culture and society, including a significant shift from a primarily subsistence way of life. Local food production in remote and northern communities is a potential avenue for improving food security, yet little information is known about how to support sustainable local food systems. 

The main purpose of this project is to gain a better understanding of the factors that help a community collectively move towards greater food security by their improvement of local food systems from the perspectives of community members in three remote First Nations communities in northern Ontario. The study uses a survey questionnaire  and interviews that have been approved by community advisory committees in each community. Findings from the questionnaires and interviews will be used to create a conceptual model for each community that depicts key demographic, social and personal (belief and values) variables at the individual level as well as barriers to and supports for food security and local food systems at the community level.  This proposed research can improve the health of First Nations populations living in northerly locations by identifying factors that can support local northern food systems and policies to strengthen community food security initiatives."

Retail food quality concerns raised by FMF members included issues with the quality of meat, produce, processed and canned foods available in retail outlets in the North.  FMF members also had concerns with, and sought advice about, preparation, storage and consumption of foods that were of questionable quality. This raises concerns about the public health implications of Northerners getting advice about food quality from an online peer forum. Food quality concerns intersected with food choice, cost and household level food security in complex ways. Based on the discussions on FMF, the authors identified the need for further research into how food quality intersects with household food security in the North. There is also a need for research into how retailers are making decisions on pricing and product choice in light of the food quality limitations of in Northern contexts."

Through supporting and evaluating community-led initiatives, this research will promote community action and self-determination of local food systems in communities in the NWT and ultimately improve health outcomes. The knowledge gathered, and shared across multiples levels (locally, regionally, territorially, government decision-makers/ knowledge users) will facilitate development of more effective programs and policies, including communication and knowledge sharing strategies, to address food security and climate change in the NWT, other northern regions in Canada, and globally, the circumpolar north, and remote communities in other countries."

Addressing these issues requires the development and evaluation of accessible, non-stigmatizing and affordable interventions that facilitate social inclusion in the home, communities and institutional settings across urban and rural Canada. A growing body of research suggests that arts-based health interventions can improve the lives of people with dementia and their carers; however, little is known about how these programs might address social inclusion specifically. The proposed research focuses on the potential of an innovative arts-based intervention, the National Ballet School of Canada's Sharing Dance for Seniors Program, to improve the social inclusion of people living with dementia and their carers. What is unique about the Sharing Dance Program is its emphasis on making dance accessible through in-person (live), on-line (live-streamed) and blended (in-person and live-streamed) dance outreach engagement sessions. The research will examine the experiences of people living with dementia and their carers participating in the program as well as assess the effectiveness of the multi-modal delivery of the program and the challenges of expanding and sustaining the program. The study will involve pilot studies of Sharing Dance for Seniors in Peterborough, Ontario and Brandon, Manitoba featuring in-depth observations and weekly diaries with program participants as well as focus groups and interviews with program participants, coordinators, instructors and volunteers. Ultimately, the research seeks to improve social inclusion for people with dementia and their carers where they live."

The planning grant will support a meeting to bring together key Canadian stakeholders working on issues around rural HIV engagement and retention in care.  
The purpose of the planning grant is to bring together a specific Working Group for Rural Engagement and Retention in Care to identify the barriers, challenges and successes in HIV testing strategies, linking HIV infected patients to expert care in rural communities in Canada, with a focus on the unique issues faced by specific populations, for example Aboriginal Peoples, and the role of the health care system and other structural factors in facilitating of impeding engagement in care.  The ultimate goal of the Working Group is to develop a team to begin meaningful discussions on the logistics of planning and submitting a targeted research intervention.  The research team aims to reflect a mix of stakeholders from rural doctors, community members and academics. Together we will discuss the possibility of preparing a CIHR operating grant application to support a specific research intervention. At the meeting, the details of an acceptable trial design will be reviewed and a rural engagement and retention to care intervention will be discussed."

They report to public health and, in this way, public health gets an idea of the timing and severity of influenza in the community.  But since many people in the community with influenza do not see a doctor, or are delayed in seeking care, the sentinel physician network may not give a complete picture and may miss the earliest cases.  During a pandemic, earliest possible detection of influenza activity could be critical to prevention and control.   With internet access, households and families could report directly and easily to public health as soon as influenza-like illness starts, without having to go through a physician to be counted.   Some households could become watchtowers and contribute to public health monitoring.  To make this manageable, we would like to assess whether a sentinel household system, with web-based reporting of ILI (influenza-like illness) directly by a defined network of households, is possible.  If it is, a sentinel household system could also become an important platform for other evaluation and information exchange during a pandemic when we will have much to rapidly learn about the new virus - such as public attitudes and concerns, which groups are affected first and worst and how well vaccine or other response measures can protect.  Our goal is to first see if a sentinel household system can be established and if so, what that would take."

Nutrition insecurity occurs when diets are not adequate in terms of variety, diversity, nutrient content, and safety to meet needs for a healthy life. Although food and nutrition insecurity have been identified as public health issues in Manitoba, there is a lack of current, detailed data for program planning and policy development to address these issues among Manitoba youth. This is especially concerning for Indigenous and newcomer youth, who are more vulnerable because of lower socio-economic status. Food and nutrition insecurity exacerbate inequities and increase risk of poorer future health and education outcomes. Working with over 15 partners, this integrated knowledge-translation study will assess food and nutrition insecurity in Manitoba youth, and how the intersection of these conditions impacts health and education outcomes. Aims: 1) describe patterns of food and nutrition insecurity, and associated dietary intakes and behaviours, in youth; 2) examine whether food bank usage and income can be used as a proxy measures for food and nutrition insecurity in youth; 3) examine the relationship between determinants of health, food/nutrition security status, and health/educational outcomes; 4) develop empirical evidence to inform food and nutrition security programs and policies. These aims will be achieved by: surveying the food/nutrition security status, and dietary/food behaviour patterns of grade 9 students; analyzing food bank use data; linking results with administrative data; and sharing results with stakeholders and decision-makers. The research will contribute to reducing disparities by generating important information which can be used by education, government and community experts to design and implement programs/policies (e.g. income security; housing support; school food and nutrition programs; surveillance)."

We will conduct a mixed-method study of the risk mitigation efforts introduced to reduce COVID-19 infection among PWUS including prescription of pharmaceutical alternatives (PALS) for opioids, stimulants, benzodiazepines, and other drugs or referral to a managed alcohol program (structured dispensing/delivery of alcohol). Linked administrative health data in combination with survey and interview data collected from PWUS and health care providers will be used to:
1) Determine the impact of PALS on COVID-19 infection; non-fatal/fatal overdose; and continuity of care for SUD and concurrent health conditions among PWUS.
2) Articulate how PALS has affected the uptake of physical distancing and other public health measures introduced to reduce the spread of COVID-19 (e.g., mask wearing, hand washing, self-isolation).
3) Identify barriers and facilitators to PALS implementation based on program uptake and the perspectives of PWUS, outreach workers, prescribers and other stakeholders.

This project will focus on assessing the effects of risk mitigation efforts on PWUS with an emphasis on First Nations peoples, persons with criminal justice system involvement and pregnant women. PWUS are more likely to have risk factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome and experience homelessness and income insecurity. This project will provide critical evidence to inform pandemic planning and emergency response activities at federal, provincial and local levels in advance of the Health Canada exemption expiring, expansion of PALS in other Canadian provinces, and upcoming 2020 flu season."

Overdose in BC is the leading cause of death of people under 30 years of age. Geography (where we live) and the physical environment of our communities (e.g. access to public transit) have been found to have an impact on mental health, substance use and physical health. However, there is very little known about how geography and the built environment affect the risk of surviving an overdose. This lack of knowledge has prevented the development of place-based interventions to reduce overdose in geographically diverse communities outside of urban centers. We will address this knowledge gap by carrying out a mixed method study to obtain a complete picture of the connections between geography, the built environment, and overdose survival. We will use linked administrative health data contained in the BC Provincial Overdose Cohort, qualitative data from interviews of people with lived/living experience, and observational data collected by the research team to better understand how the built environment influences overdose mortality risk. Mixed methods findings will be continually triangulated by the research team, including people with lived/living experience who will be appointed Research Assistants, to identify nuances and contradictions based on geography (i.e. rurality) and region.

In SR training, a client is asked to recall a piece of information (e.g., what time lunch is) over successively longer intervals by associating that information with an action (e.g., looking at a calendar). The proposed phase 2 study will build upon findings from a recent CIHR-funded phase 1 pilot study in which we demonstrated the potential benefits of SR training in helping eight individuals with AD or related disorder recall information from recent events (e.g., an activity with a grandchild; a holiday party). In the proposed study, we will measure the effectiveness of SR training with a larger sample of persons with AD who have different degrees of cognitive impairment, and we will provide longer periods of training and follow-up assessment of training outcomes. The results are expected to provide new understandings of how SR memory training can be used effectively with persons who have AD to increase their recall of recently occurring events, and with the potential of enhancing their ability to communicate and function in everyday activities."

The proposed pilot study explores new possibilities in providing SR memory training to individuals with AD. To date, SR has been found to be effective in helping persons with AD relearn object-word associations (e.g., a person's name) and recall future events (e.g., remembering to take medication). However, SR has not yet been applied to the retention of information from recent past events (e.g., yesterday's family gathering; a doctor's visit). We hypothesize that SR training will improve the memory of meaningful recent events by persons with AD. We will provide 12 persons with AD SR training on different kinds of information (e.g., recent events, face-name associations, future events) and analyze the effectiveness of training in each area. The findings are expected to provide new understandings of how memory training can be used for persons with AD to support their independence in daily life."

Innovative approaches to examining how participation in particular social contexts and environments fosters vulnerability to HIV are crucial to the development of effective interventions designed to reduce HIV transmission among this highly vulnerable population. The proposed research project will employ ethnographic methods to develop empirical information regarding how transitions into particular social contexts influence HIV risks and individual ability to engage in risk reduction among injection drug users. This information will be integrated with findings from ongoing epidemiological studies in the same locales to test socially-oriented hypotheses regarding the relationship between HIV vulnerabilities and particular social contexts.

It creates a huge burden of increased morbidity and costs. Risk factors contributing to asthma development include genetic, host and environmental factors. There are controversies about the association between exposure to ambient air pollutants and the development of asthma. Nonetheless, one recent study suggests that a large proportion of the geographic variation in asthma incidence in children could be explained by exposure to on-road traffic-related pollutants. Given the importance of this observation to orient public health interventions, studies are needed to confirm or refute these results. Furthermore, few cohort studies have assessed the association between community exposure to industrial emissions of air pollutants and the development of asthma. We propose the construction of a population-based birth cohort using Quebec Health Care administrative databases to i) describe the geographic variation of asthma incidence in Quebec; ii) assess whether new cases of asthma in children are associated with long-term residential exposure to local on-road traffic, with industrial air pollutant emissions and, with secondary air pollutants such as ozone and fine particles; iii) relate geographic variations in occurrence of new cases of asthma in children through Quebec's regions to children's long-term exposure to air pollutants. This project will contribute to our understanding of the effects of air pollutants on asthma onset in children. It will provide information to calculate incident cases attributable to air pollutant exposure for environmental health and chronic disease surveillance in Quebec and in Canada; this will help target best interventions to reduce health impacts of air pollutants."

The second part will allow communities to modify the evaluation to fit the particular content of their youth programs.

Currently there is a significant health gap between Aboriginal people and the rest of the population. On almost any measure of health and well-being, Aboriginal people fare worse than other Canadians. In response, Aboriginal communities are mounting programs that aim to improve their health. In the Yukon Territory, for example, all First Nations have ""on-the-land"" programs for their youth. The content of these programs varies from one community to the next, from programs that concentrate on traditional food gathering and preparation, or traditional medicine, to wilderness safety and survival skills. What the programs share, however, is a need for evaluation - a tool that could be used by all communities, and yet also address the unique features of individual programs would support the goal of assessing Aboriginal youth wilderness programs. This tool would offer a way to communicate the efficacy of these youth programs in general and to document the specific benefits of particular programs."

There is currently no Regular Garbage Pickup (RGP). The present pickup system is inadequate, and the community is covered in refuse. The current state of affairs presents health and environmental risks. 

The objectives of the study are to (1) educate stakeholders of the risks associated with poor Waste Management (WM) practices, (2) outline three RGP options for the consideration of Chief and Council; (3) make disposal site recommendations that compliment the implementation of RGP; and (4) educate residents, through reflection, in undertaking community-based planning projects (i.e., promote community self-reliance).

Methods used include: (1) a literary search to understand the risks resulting from poor WM practices, address culturally relevant issues in a First Nations context, and identify national and international examples of WM models that are applicable to the First Nation; (2) field reconnaissance and photography to illustrate risks that are of concern to the First Nation; (3) interviews to learn about former and current WM in the First Nation, and RGP in nearby remote northern First Nations; and (4) public participation sessions to educate residents about risks, gain public input, and develop community-relevant RGP options. 

Finalized RGP options include schematics for bin construction; diagrams for pickup stations; pickup schedules, including detailed routes and timetables; budgets; and recommended policies and procedures for RGP and dumpsite operations. All household and route data are stored and displayed using Geographic Information Systems (ArcGIS). 

The research is critical because it has the potential to improve the cultural and physical health of Garden Hill First Nation and be used as a waste management model for other isolated northern First Nations."
Improving Canadian Lung Cancer Screening Efficiency with a Computed Tomography Risk Classifier,"['Smith, Benjamin M', 'Kirby, Miranda A', 'Sadatsafavi, Mohsen']","['Benedetti, Andrea', 'Ezer, Nicole', 'Johnson, Kate M']","['Airways', 'Computed Tomography', 'Lung Cancer', 'Screening']",914175.0,469495,"Goal: To improve Canadian lung cancer (LC) screening efficiency by exploiting predictive information on the screening CT scan.
Background: LC is the leading cause of cancer death in Canada. CT screening lowers LC mortality but is associated with false-positive screens, unnecessary procedure-related complications, radiation exposure and healthcare costs.
LC screening efficiency is related to the risk of LC in the population screened, and LC screening programs rely on a baseline LC risk calculator to determine eligibility. We believe LC efficiency can be improved greatly by incorporating information contained within the baseline CT scan.
The airway tree is our first line of defence against cigarette smoke and is the main site of LC. Variation in airway tree caliber is common in the general population and this variation is strongly associated with higher risk of LC death among smokers (5.31-fold higher LC death rate)! Whether this airway tree risk classifier can improve LC risk prediction in the LC screening setting is uncertain, as is the potential for the airway tree risk classifier to improve screening efficiency when applied in Canadian LC screening setting.
Aim 1: To quantify the improvement in LC risk prediction when incorporating a baseline CT airway tree risk classifier.
Aim 2: Perform a cost-effectiveness analysis to determine whether incorporating the baseline CT airway tree risk classifier improves LC screening efficiency in Canada.
Methods: We will use trial data to evaluate LC risk prediction, and supplement these data with 'real-world' Canadian screening data for cost-effectiveness analyses.
Expertise: Our team brings proven expertise in epidemiology, lung cancer, CT imaging and health economics.
Expected Outcomes: This study will provide pivotal evidence that a baseline CT airway tree risk classifier can improve LC screening efficiency in Canada, including decision modelling estimates to inform subsequent economic analyses and guide policy makers."

Emerging evidence suggests that lung growth and immune development are interconnected and, when impaired, increases risk of lung disease across the lifespan. Our proposal will investigate the intersection of inflammation and lung growth in diverse populations in hopes of identifying novel strategies to meaningfully and equitably achieve lifelong health.
Our lungs grow 1000-fold in size and develop a specialized immune system to defend against inflammatory stimuli over the entire life course. We and others have shown that impaired lung growth is associated with higher levels of inflammation well into adulthood and pre-mature death from inflammation-driven diseases (e.g., chronic obstructive lung diseases, respiratory infection, cardiovascular disease, cancer). These findings suggests that lung growth impairment is associated with sustained activation of inflammatory pathways that increase lung disease risk - a concept we term ""immune dysanapsis"" (dys=unequal; anaptixy=growth).
If funded, this grant will unite experts in respiratory epidemiology, medicine, physiology, lung immunobiology and environmental exposure assessment. We include diverse and understudied populations in terms of ages, genetic ancestry, socio-economics and urban/rural communities.
Impact: The proposed research will establish immune dysanapsis an important contributor to lung health and disease across the life course. It will facilitate identification of modifiable exposures, periods of susceptibility, clinical relevance and promising biological pathways to target in future research to achieve lifelong lung health."

Studies have shown that risk factors for heart disease, for example obesity, smoking, physical activity and diet, tend to occur more frequently, and often appear together, in individuals with low socioeconomic status. The goal of the study is to help determine which heart disease risk factors are most influential in causing the increase in heart disease among individuals of low socioeconomic status. To answer this important research question, the authors will investigate a series of what if scenarios regarding potential changes to levels of heart disease risk factors in a population of Ontarians. For example, will increasing the number of physically active Ontarians, or decreasing the number of Ontarians who smoke heavily be more effective in closing the gap in heart disease between individuals with low compared to high socioeconomic status? Additionally, the proposed research will explore whether policies and programs to reduce heart disease risk factors should focus on the whole population, or only on individuals with lower socioeconomic status. Answering these questions are essential to identifying which heart disease risk factors, and which groups of individuals, should be targeted by public health programs and policies to reduce the burden of heart disease in individuals with low socioeconomic status. This research will provide policy-makers with the evidence necessary to act, and help reduce heart disease in Ontario."
Cardiovascular disease attributable to nutrition-related causes: Estimating future burden and evaluating nutrition policy options for maximizing population health benefit in Canada,"['Smith, Brendan', 'Manuel, Douglas G']","['Anderson, Laura N', 'Arcand, JoAnne', 'Hammond, David G', 'Hobin, Erin P', 'Jessri, Mahsa', ""L'Abbe, Mary R"", 'Manson, Heather', 'Mclaren, Lindsay', 'Rosella, Laura C']","['Cardiovascular Disease Prevention', 'Health Equity', 'Population And Public Health', 'Population Health Intervention Research', 'Population-Based Risk Tools', 'Public Health Nutrition', 'Public Health Policy Evaluation', 'Sodium', 'Sugar']",325125.0,371988,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality in Canada. Studies have shown that individuals who consume excess sodium and sugar-sweetened beverages are more likely to develop CVD. Excess consumption of these dietary factors is common in Canada, leading the Canadian Government to identify sodium and sugar-sweetened beverages as high priority policy targets requiring effective interventions. To help reduce sodium and sugar-sweetened beverages consumption, three population-level dietary interventions are being considered: 1) cutting sodium in processed foods; 2) taxing sugar-sweetened beverages; and, 3) mandatory front-of-package food labels for packaged foods. 

The project goal is to determine whether three proposed population-level dietary interventions will impact sodium and sugar-sweetened beverage intakes and CVD in Canada. We will explore whether the intervention benefits are equally experienced across social groups (i.e., age, sex, socioeconomic status and food insecurity). To answer these important research questions, we will use the Cardiovascular Disease Population Risk Tool (CVDPoRT), a policy tool that predicts the likelihood of developing CVD based on individual risk factors profiles. 

This research will describe current sodium and sugar-sweetened beverage intakes using the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) 2015 (the first national nutrition survey since 2004). We will estimate the anticipated change in consumption-levels that would be achieved if the three population-level dietary interventions were implemented. Applying CVDPoRT to CCHS 2015 data, we will predict the number of CVD cases avoided, both in the population and across social groups, by implementing the three population-level dietary interventions. This research will fill a critical gap by providing policy-makers with the evidence to inform the implementation of population-level dietary interventions to reduce nutrition-related CVD in Canada."

Although the highest alcohol consumers are at the greatest risk for disease, there is a dose-response relationship between alcohol and several chronic diseases. It is also known that some of the negative health impacts of alcohol can be reversed by reducing alcohol intake. Evidence now indicates regular low levels of alcohol use also have detrimental impacts on health. In response, Canada has released updated Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines that reflect the most recent health evidence; however, the health benefits of adhering to the updated Low-Risk Drinking Guidelines in the Canadian population are unknown. A prospective cohort study will be conducted using data on 25,000 adults over 45 years of age from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) to test the impact of low- moderate-, and high-risk alcohol intake, defined by the updated Low-Risk Drinking Guidelines, on years free from major chronic diseases over a 10-year period. We will also explore these relationships according to sex, age, socioeconomic status, and obesity status. Our study will provide evidence of the impact of the updated Low-Risk Drinking Guidelines on years free from chronic disease, and potential differential effects on subgroups within the Canadian population. This research is necessary given the detrimental effects of alcohol on the health of Canadians and can inform public health messaging and policies."

The best known brain vascular disease is stroke (a blockage of blood supply to the brain, or a brain bleed), but there are also other forms of blood vessel problems that can lead to VCI. People affected by VCI often have risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol.  Research has suggested ways to reduce the risk and progression of VCI by managing risk factors, but many people do not know much about VCI, how to prevent it, or what to do if a doctor diagnoses them with it. 

In collaboration with people with lived experience with vascular dementia, we aim to co-develop a series of educational videos in both French and English, aimed at raising awareness of VCI and its risk factors, and improving quality of life for those living with VCI. The videos will be targeted towards the general public, people experiencing cognitive symptoms, their care partners, and their healthcare providers.

To develop and evaluate these videos, we are working with people with lived experience of VCI who are developing research skills through the University of Calgary's Patient and Community Engagement Research (PaCER) program. Our learners will design and carry out a research project to evaluate the videos. Based on the research results, we will modify the videos to improve their effectiveness and relatability. Finally, we will share the videos online through partnerships with community organizations and medical schools. Our goal is to improve knowledge related to VCI and raise awareness of ways to reduce the risk of and progression of the disease. This will enable us to better support persons with lived experience of VCI and their healthcare providers."

Exercise Interventions to Mitigate Side Effects of Myeloid Leukemia: A Systematic Review of the Literature,"['Smith, Jenna']",['N/A'],"['Exercise', 'Hematology', 'Myeloid Leukemia', 'Physical Activity', 'Physical Therapy']",1000.0,331756,"Research Objectives: To explore the current literature examining the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of exercise interventions for individuals with myeloid leukemia.

Data Sources: A literature search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, AMED, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, CENTRAL, and Web of Science using the terms ""exercise"" OR ""physical activity"" AND ""myeloid leukemia.""

Study Selection: Two reviewers performed duplicate title/abstract and full text screening of clinical trials comparing outcomes for people with myeloid leukemia participating in an exercise program. Initial searches yielded 149 articles.

Data Extraction: Two reviewers independently extracted data using piloted forms and assessed risk of bias using Cochrane's tool. Data was extracted in relation to the study population, study intervention, comparator intervention, and outcomes assessed.

Data Synthesis: Five trials were included in this review after 20 full text articles were screened. Risk of bias was determined to be high in all five studies. Adherence rates were found to be low (<30%) in all studies measuring this outcome. Positive improvements were found for fatigue, physical functioning, quality of life, and psychological distress for patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), however not all findings were significant. Leukocyte and BCR-ABL1 levels increased significantly post exercise for participants with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Only one adverse event was reported.

Conclusions: Exercise interventions appear safe and feasible for individuals with AML. Not enough evidence was presented to comment on the feasibility of exercise programs for individuals with CML. Inconclusive evidence was found on the effectiveness of exercise to minimize side effects for participants with AML."
The health and economic impact of Ontario's Grade 8 HPV vaccination program,"['Smith, Leah M']",['N/A'],"['Cohort Study', 'Cost-Effectiveness', 'Hpv Vaccine', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Population And Public Health']",105000.0,229614,"Every year, the Ontario government invests about $39 million in a program that offers the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine to all Grade 8 girls in the province. However, almost 50% of eligible girls are refusing to get vaccinated. This poor acceptance has been largely attributed to concerns among parents who feel there is not yet enough information about the real world effects of this vaccine. At the same time, such low uptake threatens public health efforts aimed making the costly initiative worthwhile. The objectives of this thesis are to assess the vaccine's effect on the incidence of genital warts and uptake of Pap screening, and to evaluate the real world cost-effectiveness of Ontario's program.

This study is based on all girls eligible for Ontario's Grade 8 HPV vaccination program between 2007 and 2011. Information on the girls' HPV vaccine use and medical history will be obtained from Ontario administrative health databases. This information will be used to determine if the risk of developing genital warts differs between girls who get the vaccine and girls who do not. In addition, it will be used to determine whether Pap screening, an established mean of preventing cervical cancer, is affected by HPV vaccination. Finally, to determine the economic value of Ontario's HPV vaccination program, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed based on the program's first five years of implementation. 

In efforts to maximize the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of Ontario's publicly funded HPV vaccination program, it is important that its effects are monitored and evaluated. The results of this study will provide information about the real world effects of the HPV vaccine that could help individuals make more educated decisions about vaccination. In addition, the results can assist public health decision-makers in making informed policy recommendations about ways to improve future HPV vaccine programming."

VGFN is a self-governing First Nation* who are progressive and innovative in relation to climate change, health and wellness, and economic sovereignty. They have taken numerous proactive approaches during COVID-19 to protect citizens by instituting controlled access to the community, and using a local risk matrix. Vaccine uptake is high with 86% fully-vaccinated citizens.
This grant would support the community and Yukon University to reveal the impacts of COVID-19 on the citizens of Old Crow. The project will be led by a member of the VGFN government (co-applicant), the Scientific Director of the Yukon SPOR unit (NPI), a VGFN Knowledge Keeper, and a Sex and Gender champion at Yukon University. A community researcher will be hired from, and reside in Old Crow. The fundamentals of OCAP, UNDRIP and TCPS-2 will be at the forefront of the research.
Research will be grounded in Indigenous Knowledge and lived experience, using culturally-appropriate, meaningful methodology. Stories and experiences of the First Nation citizens will be heard, privileging the voices of Elders, to explore the successes and challenges that arose these past two years. The community has stories of ancestral responses to previous epidemics/pandemics that remain. Indigenous Knowledge passed through generations has supported the resilience of First Nation people in Canada's north to thrive through centuries of challenges. Lessons from this community add depth and new learning to our western health systems. 
Though Old Crow faces challenges to the health and wellness of citizens, the strengths of this community and collective approach to COVID-19 may support a model for other rural/remote/northern and Indigenous communities in Canada.

Type 1 diabetes, without proper management can lead to serious complications, including limb amputation and death, and also results in significant costs to the health system. The Canadian Chronic Disease Surveillance System data tool reported that there were 265 cases of Diabetes in Yukon in 2021/2022 (Canada, 2024). This number reflects all types of diabetes. In the Yukon territory, there are no accurate data sets reflecting the number of people living with T1DM, which creates a knowledge gap.

Just what is 'Just' in Public Health? A Qualitative Study of Public Health Policy-Maker Perspectives,"['Smith, Maxwell']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,324242,"Social justice is routinely identified as a central value for public health practice. For instance, the claim that 'social justice is the foundation of public health' has a long history in both the public health and public health ethics literature. The concept of social justice is commonly invoked in practice as well; for example, 'a commitment to social justice' is included in the Public Health Agency of Canada's statement on the core competencies necessary for the practice of public health.

Yet, at the same time it is rarely acknowledged that social justice is a multifaceted concept with a rich pedigree in philosophy. As such, the concept of social justice often precludes a single (or simple) interpretation or application, which means a commitment to social justice in practice might tend to refer to diverse, if not divergent, views about the ethical goals and obligations of public health. If social justice is to play a central role in public health, then its conceptual and practical features ought to be further investigated so that it may provide robust, consistent, and practicable ethical guidance for policy and practice.

While an emerging body of philosophical literature has begun to explore the concept of social justice in public health, this work has not empirically explored how those working in public health conceptualize social justice in their practice nor the extent to which these perspectives align with philosophical accounts of social justice. This presentation reports findings from a qualitative study that involved key informant interviews with public health policy-makers in two distinct domains of public health in Canada, chronic disease prevention and public health emergency preparedness and response, which were conducted with the aim of achieving contextual understanding of how social justice is conceptualized and negotiated in public health practice and to capture whether different norms of social justice exist in different public health contexts."

For example, 'a commitment to social justice' is included in the Public Health Agency of Canada's statement on the core competencies necessary for the practice of public health. Public health's social justice motivation is central to explicitly considering which populations are being included and excluded from public health solutions, and who will benefit and who will be harmed. Yet, it is often unclear as to what a commitment to social justice requires in the context of public health and how this ought to translate into policy, practice, and research. Indeed, the concept of social justice often precludes a single (or simple) interpretation or application given the value's rich pedigree in moral and political philosophy, which means that a commitment to social justice in practice might tend to refer to diverse, if not divergent, views about the goals and obligations of public health. If social justice is to play a central role in public health, then its features ought to be examined so that it may provide robust, consistent, and practicable ethical guidance for policy and practice.

Using the validated Diabetes Population Risk Tool (DPoRT), ten-year diabetes risk was calculated for respondents to the nationally representative 2015-16 Canadian Community Health Survey (n=67,867). The number of diabetes cases prevented or delayed was estimated across low, medium, and high education categories according to two ethical criteria: 1) 'Equality' (equalizing diabetes risk); 2) 'Sufficiency' (reducing diabetes risk below the DPoRT high-risk threshold (over 16.5), beyond which remaining inequalities are not considered ethically important). Hypothetical percent weight-loss interventions in overweight and obese individuals were modeled for each ethical criterion. In total, 1,811,017 new diabetes cases were predicted for 2026. Education was inversely associated with baseline diabetes risk (risk ratio (RR)=1.68, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.63,1.73; low compared to high education). 'Equality' was achieved by implementing 20% and 15% weight-loss interventions in low and medium education groups. 'Sufficiency' was achieved by a 14% weight-loss intervention in high-risk individuals; however, large social inequalities in diabetes remained in this scenario (RR= 1.52, 95%CI: 1.48-1.56; low compared to high education). These interventions resulted in 246,923 and 267,690 diabetes cases prevented or delayed, respectively. This study is the first of its kind to illustrate how adopting different criteria of equity offered by public health ethicists could impact population health outcomes. As such, this study represents a promising program of research, the findings of which being poised to transform the ethical design of public health interventions which aim to 'reduce health inequities'."

Thus, an important priority in examining the health equity implications of the use of AI approaches in health is first mapping the novel equity questions, dimensions, and challenges posed by AI approaches in health. While an emerging body of literature has thus far begun to explore the ethical challenges posed by AI in the health care context, scant attention has hitherto been paid to the distinctive moral questions (including questions of equity) raised by the use of AI to identify, measure, or address public health challenges and solutions. As such, we plan to host a two-day planning meeting to: 1. bring together a group of research leaders, early career researchers, and trainees from public health ethics, AI, innovation policy, and responsible innovation, with representatives from industry (AI), public health and health care policy and practice, and from populations who may traditionally be considered marginalized or disadvantaged relative to innovations in health technology; 2. provide an opportunity for every participant, representing the groups identified in (1), to act as both a contributor and listener through an innovative 'fishbowl' methodology; and 3. generate a comprehensive, multi-perspective research agenda and internationally-connected cohort of scholars and practitioners that aim to explore and uncover the multitude of interests, needs, values, and perspectives in relation to the equity dimensions and questions raised by AI in public health."
Ethical Pathways for Therapeutics and Vaccine R&D in the Context of Public Health Emergencies of International Concern: An Analysis of the 2013-16 Ebola Outbreak to Rapidly Inform COVID-19 R&D,"['Smith, Maxwell', 'Upshur, Ross E']","['Ahmad, Aasim', 'Bah-SOW, Oumou Y', 'da Costa ThomÃ©, Beatriz', 'Dawson, Angus J', 'ILIYASU, Zubairu', 'Lei, Ruipeng', 'Silva, Diego S', 'Voo, Teck Chuan']","['Covid-19', 'Ebola Virus Disease', 'Ethics', 'Global Coordination', 'Governance', 'Key Informant Interview', 'Public Perspectives', 'Randomized Controlled Trials', 'Research Ethics', 'Survey']",,422556,"A cross-cutting research priority identified by the recent WHO COVID-19 Global Research and Innovation Forum is the establishment of appropriate ethical oversight and global collaboration to accelerate COVID-19 R&D, and to establish these in such a way that promotes solidarity and equity. Yet, the existing COVID-19 research roadmap and WHO R&D Blueprint are largely silent on the global ethical pathways required to guide and oversee rapid therapeutics and vaccine R&D in this context (including whether and how such pathways ought to be modified, or precisely what solidarity and equity require for these activities). 

To identify and successfully navigate these ethical and regulatory pathways for COVID-19 R&D, we can look to the unprecedented R&D response to the 2013-16 Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak for guidance. Only five months following the development of the first study protocols for EVD, the first patients were enrolled in clinical trials. Only four years later, the first vaccine was licensed in the United States. The atypical expediency of these R&D efforts was, in part, a product of significant modifications and adaptations to the usual ethical and regulatory pathways for health product development-pathways that involve ethical inputs into study protocols, independent ethics review of studies, global consultation and governance, data sharing agreements, and the approval, licensure, and dissemination of resulting products.

This project will for the first time (1) analyze and describe the ethical pathways for R&D that existed or were established for EVD in order to aid the global research community in navigating these pathways for COVID-19 R&D; (2) analyze and describe the ethical pathways as they are established and navigated for COVID-19 R&D in order to rapidly support ongoing and future COVID-19 R&D; and (3) compare and conduct an ethical analysis of the ethical pathways for EVD and COVID-19 R&D to inform future R&D during epidemics."

The achievement of this objective is contingent on two activities: (1) rigorous and systematic research on key ethical issues expected to arise in future infectious disease emergencies, with a specific focus on how such issues have been shaped by Canadians' experiences with the COVID-19 pandemic and responses to it; and (2) effective translation and integration of such research and knowledge into decision-making in infectious disease emergencies (i.e., 'ethics to policy').

Working with public health decision-makers locally, provincially, and internationally, this program of research will significantly advance both of these aims in Canada by examining three central ethical challenges identified by policymakers that require scrutiny in the post-COVID-19 landscape (that is, following the advent of COVID-19), and by doing so in a way that is oriented toward the practical realities faced by decision-makers. These challenges include: (a) the equitable allocation of scarce resources like vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; (b) balancing the rights of the individual and the interests of society when using population health interventions like isolation, quarantine, and mandates; and (c) the design and conduct of research in and for infectious disease emergencies. The principal outputs of this program of research will include a comprehensive 'Infectious Disease Ethics Playbook' that offers policy-oriented guidance in these domains, designed for use by decision-makers, as well as the establishment of best practices for generating ethical information, analyses, and advice for decision-makers in real-time when making decisions during infectious disease emergencies."

The limited data available suggest that, relative to gay men, bisexual men are at increased risk for HIV. However, research exploring HIV risk determinants in men who have sex with men has failed to explore the unique psychosocial issues of bisexual men and how those factors are related to HIV risk. Using minority stress theory and syndemics as theoretical frameworks, this project will explore the associations between various aspects of minority stress specific to bisexual men (i.e., internalized binegativity, feelings of illegitimacy, anticipated binegativity, lack of bisexual identity affirmation, and anti-bisexual prejudice), mental health (i.e., anxiety, depression, psychological distress, and self-esteem), substance use, and risk factors for HIV (i.e., multiple sexual partners and unprotected anal and/or vaginal intercourse). The results will shed important light on the unique determinants of HIV risk among bisexual men and have implications for developing HIV prevention methods targeted specially at this high-risk population."

We are now seeking funding to conduct two additional surveys to examine changes in these dimensions after the introduction of mandatory awareness training in Ontario.  Importantly, we can compare changes in our measure in Ontario to changes occurring in British Columbia, where no similar program is taking place. In addition, we will examine if changes in Ontario that occur at the population level are similar within labour market sub-groups (e.g. age, workplace size) and the implications that any differences found might have on inequalities in risk of work-injury among Ontario labour force participants."

Often subgroups of labour market participants, for example younger workers, new workers, immigrants or visible minorities are labelled as vulnerable. Yet, this categorization of workers does not identify the specific characteristics that place these workers at higher risk of experiencing a work-related injury. Using feedback from various OH&S stakeholder groups, this project will develop a measure of OH&S vulnerability among labour market participants that moves beyond demographic worker characteristics towards factors that are more proximal to risk of injury or illness at the level of the worker.  We will then develop a refine a measure of OH&S vulnerability that can be used for public health surveillance purposes.  The development and implementation of this measure will allow new knowledge to be generated about factors relevant to the occupational health and safety primary prevention, as well as the reduction in inequalities, of work injuries and illnesses in Canada."

As the number of compensation claims from older workers and female labour force participants increase across Canada there is a need to identify where differences in the return to work process occur for these two groups, and if these are shaped by biological or social factors.  Doing so will allow the development of targeted interventions to improve the health and economic outcomes of older workers and female workers, following a work-related injury."

In addition, gender differences in the return-to-work process and outcomes after injury are not well-understood. This research program will generate new research across three areas where there are significant gaps in knowledge concerning the work and health experiences of men and women. These are: (1) The psycho-social work environment, including job control, psychological demands and social support, and the development of hypertension and diabetes among men and women; (2) Gender and sex differences in work-related risk factors for occupational injury and disease; (3) Individual, workplace and health-care provider factors leading to differences in the return-to-work outcomes after work-related injury among men and women. This research program will lead to a more nuanced understanding of how sex/gender shape injury risk, the relationship between the work environment and chronic illnesses, and time off work after a work-related injury. By involving an independent advisory committee consisting of leading occupational health and safety stakeholders throughout the research process, this new research knowledge will in turn help shape the development of gender- and sex-sensitive policies and practices to improve the health of all working Canadians."

Currently, one in five labour market participants is an immigrant and new immigration is expected to account for all labour market growth within the next three years.  Past research has suggested that certain immigrant groups (e.g. South Asian) may be at higher risk for particular health problems such as diabetes and high blood pressure compared to people born in Canada.  Examining factors associated with diabetes and high blood pressure is important as both these diseases have increased rapidly over the previous two decades.  Several working conditions are associated with increased risk of diabetes and high blood pressure.  Examples of these working conditions are an individual's ability to use their skills and the authority to make decisions over the way they work (referred to as job control) and having higher qualifications than a job requires (overqualification).  Particular immigrant groups might experience these working environments more often than Canadian-born workers.  However, the impact of immigrants' labour market experiences on their risk of diabetes and high blood pressure has not been extensively examined in Canada.  This project seeks to examine the relationship between immigrant status, working conditions and the incidence of diabetes and hypertension over a five- to seven-year period.  This research will help us to understand the relative contribution that ethnicity, work conditions and health behaviours have on these two increasingly important health outcomes. Based on our results we will suggest potential prevention and policy responses to help reduce the numbers of Canadians, in particular immigrants, who suffer from these conditions."

Cannabis and Workplace Fatalities: Establishing a Baseline in Ontario,"['Smith, Peter M', 'Rajaram, Nikhil']","['Fang, Lily', 'Smith, Melissa', 'Carnide, Nancy', 'Furlan, Andrea D', 'Mustard, Cameron A']","['Cannabis', 'Coroner Data', 'Impairment', 'Workplace Fatalities']",124524.0,392309,"Cannabis use for non-medical purposes will soon be legalized in Canada. Researchers have recommended a set of indicators to monitor to understand the impact of legalization on public safety. While work injuries are part of these recommendations, there is no existing data source in Canada that can be used to estimate the current extent of cannabis involvement in workplace accidents, nor be used to measure trends over time.

From 2006 to 2016, there were 4,096 traumatic workplace fatalities across Canada, with 944 (23%) in Ontario alone. Coroners in Ontario investigate all accidental deaths occurring on the job, which can include measuring the presence of drugs in the body. Thus, coroner records may provide an important source of information that can be used to establish data on the extent of the issue and monitor changes over time.

This project aims to understand the feasibility of using coroner data as a data source for monitoring cannabis-related workplace fatalities. Using coroner records in Ontario from 2006 to 2016 as a preliminary step, we will create a comprehensive, standardized dataset to measure the nature and scope of cannabis involvement in workplace fatalities. We will measure trends in cannabis-related workplace fatalities over time and explore how fatalities with and without cannabis involvement differ by worker, workplace, and incident characteristics. We will examine whether alcohol or other drugs were also involved. We will work with stakeholders to develop a standard tool to be used to extract data.

This study will provide information to understand the extent to which cannabis may be involved in workplace fatalities in Ontario and establish a process for continued monitoring after legalization. This project will also act as a catalyst for future similar work in other provinces and territories and will help to inform the development of policies, practices, and programs related to workplace cannabis use."

Canadian researchers have recommended a number of indicators that need to be monitored in order to understand the impact of this major policy change on public health and safety. Yet absent from consideration is how legalization may impact use before and at work. Given the important role of work in the lives of Canadians, there is the potential for cannabis use to spill over to the workplace after legalization, which could have occupational health and safety consequences.

We recently conducted a survey of 2,014 workers across Canada from a wide range of industries and occupations to better understand current (pre-legalization) workplace use patterns and perceptions. Preliminary findings suggest some workers engage in potentially risky workplace use and demonstrate problematic perceptions of the risks of using cannabis in the workplace. The results justify the need to monitor these patterns following legalization.

Through this study, we will continue to collect information from this group of workers to determine whether legalization is associated with changes in workplace use and related perceptions and norms. We will also increase the study sample to ensure we accurately estimate the extent of workplace cannabis use and better understand workplace cannabis use patterns among workers in safety-sensitive occupations, who are at highest risk for safety consequences of workplace use. We will survey 4,000 workers at one, two, and three years after legalization and explore whether differences in trends exist across segments of the labour market. We will also examine how perceptions and norms may influence future cannabis use and vice versa.

This project will provide information to understand the short-term effects of legalization on the workplace and help to inform development of policies, practices, and prevention initiatives to ensure lower risk use among Canadian workers."

Employers do not feel prepared to address the challenges they will face in managing cannabis use in the workplace once it is legalized and have an appetite for information that can be used to develop effective workplace policies and approaches. However, we know virtually nothing about the extent to which Canadian workers currently consume cannabis and their perceptions around use of cannabis in the workplace.

We propose to collect information from a survey of Canadian workers to better understand the current magnitude of cannabis consumption at work, workers' intentions to use cannabis at work following legalization, reasons for use, perceptions of how cannabis affects workplace performance and safety, knowledge of cannabis effects, and norms around use in their own workplaces. We will also explore whether these views differ across segments of the labour market (e.g., workers in particular industrial or demographic groups). The survey will be conducted through a research survey firm, with additional input provided through focus groups of workers in specific industry groups. The completion of this project will provide a dataset of current cannabis consumption at work and related perceptions against which we can measure and monitor the impact of legalization in the workplace over time. More practically, this study will provide the information necessary for stakeholders, including employers, occupational health and safety associations, and provincial/territorial policy makers, to inform development of policies and regulations around cannabis use in the workplace, as well as messaging for educational campaigns to reduce harms in this potentially vulnerable population."

It is important to understand what the long-term health and employment outcomes are amongst workers who acquired COVID-19 through workplace exposures. Canadians who have acquired COVID-19 at work likely experience unique circumstances that could influence how well they recover physically, how they fare emotionally, and their process of returning to the workplace where their infection occurred. To better understand these impacts in this study we will collect survey data to estimate the prevalence of depression, anxiety, physical function, and self-rated health among these workers, as well as documenting if they are back at work, and working in the same occupation. We will conduct surveys approximately 18 months after the initial COVID-19 absence. We will compare these experiences with other workers who had a workers' compensation claim around the same time, but where the injury and illness was not related to COVID-19.  Findings from this project will provide a much needed knowledge base for workplaces and workers' compensation agencies to better understand and address the impacts of COVID-19 among workers in Canada."

Addressing this measurement gap, and providing ""how to"" examples of ways in which these measures can be incorporated into quantitative health research analyses, will facilitate greater progress in designing and conducting health research in a way that allows researchers to better understand how social and biological factors interact to affect health. To achieve this goal we will identify currently used measures of gender. Using primary data collection, we will then develop, or modify existing, measures that capture each dimension of gender, and examine the relationships among each of these dimensions of gender, and with sex at birth. These models will then be extended to examine the relationships between different dimensions of gender and health outcomes, and to also examine if discordance across gender dimensions is associated with poorer health status."

PHM is a set of processes for using health and social data to identify communities' needs, proactively plan services/policy, and act on health inequities. The purpose of this fellowship is to collaboratively lead stakeholders from three OHT organizations in implementing and evaluating the implementation of a novel PHM framework developed by Dr. Andrew Pinto and colleagues and championed by the Ontario Hospital Association (OHA). With the OHA, I will enact the impact goal of supporting PHM implementation across OHTs particularly by leveraging OHA's knowledge exchange, data collection, and novel data analytics infrastructure. The project will proceed in three phases starting with a review of scientific research on best-practices in PHM and seeking local perspectives on OHT-specific needs (e.g. financial, data, and organizational management) for sustainable PHM implementation. The implementation phase will use rapid improvement cycles to identify and apply the framework to each OHT's unique context, and develop data acquisition, management and reporting processes that can be embedded into OHA's novel data platform to measure health inequities. Six months post-implementation, we will conduct a mixed methods realist evaluation examining what factors influence to what extent the PHM framework is enacted and how PHM influences OHT data use, decision-making, and service design. Publicly-available research articles, data management and analysis manuals, and PHM implementation training materials will then be developed to help ensure PHM is safely and effectively used to assist all OHTs in realizing their vision."

This is a big problem since the majority of Indigenous peoples now live in cities and Indigenous peoples experience a high burden health and social challenges that doesn't improve with urban residence.  A new approach to gathering FNIM health information in cities is needed.

The goal of this research program is to develop, share, test and apply new models and methods to gather this information.  We will do this by working together with FNIM and allied health and health information organizations at the national, regional, and city levels.  We will also work to train more people who have advanced skills to do this work.

Working together at a national level we will develop and share new models and standards for urban FNIM health information.  At the regional level we will design and test training workshops.  At the city level we will continue to build better urban FNIM datasets using some specialized methods we have developed over the past 10 years.  These methods use social networks to find FNIM peoples living in cities who are otherwise hidden in the regular information systems.  In this research program we will test out these methods in Winnipeg, which will be the first time that we have tested them outside of Ontario.

To do this work we have gathered together a team of over 50 FNIM organizational partners and researchers from across Canada and around the world.

This research program has the potential to change the way that FNIM living in cities are counted, ensuring that in the future every FNIM person is counted in, regardless of where they live.  This new information will in turn improve health services for FNIM in cities, making them more effective and efficient."

The proposed study is a pilot randomized control trial to assess the feasibility of a randomized control trial  designed to assess efficacy. For the pilot trial we will assess recruitment, treatment fidelity, participant adherence and safety. The intervention arm will receive wraparound care initiated at the time of their visit for injury due to violence. The control arm will receive standard of care (usually a list of community contacts). We will use an adapted pre-consent randomization methodology.

Recent findings have highlighted the significant barriers to accessing health services among young Indigenous people who use drugs - including unaddressed trauma and the lack of cultural safety offered in the healthcare system. The Partnership has called for the Cedar Project to contribute to educating health services about practical ways to deliver culturally-safe and trauma-informed healthcare to young Indigenous people who use drugs. To our knowledge, there is very little information available on successful ways of integrating culturally-safe and trauma-informed models of care, however members of the Cedar Project Partnership and others in the community have been providing such services for decades. 

We are seeking support from the Institute of Aboriginal People's Health - Institute Community Support for the following three aims: 1) to disseminate quantitative and qualitative research findings regarding trauma and access to care that has been shared by Cedar Project participants; 2) to host sharing circles with Cedar participants, Indigenous Elders, and health service providers with the objective of gathering wisdom about culturally-safe and trauma-informed care; and, 3) to create a handbook of practical recommendations for delivering culturally-safe and trauma-informed healthcare."

While the former typically affects men under age 40, the latter tends to occur more frequently in older men.  It is predicted that this generation gap may play a role in the patient's self-concept, his understanding of masculinity, and how his cancer diagnosis/treatment intersects these elements.  Qualitative research is necessary to explore these issues.  Using the qualitative research method of photo elicitation, my Doctoral research builds upon my Master's thesis, which explores the lived experiences of men who have been diagnosed with testicular cancer, to include prostate cancer survivors.  As a visual methodology, photo elicitation includes the use of photographs during the interview process.  The intent behind this method is that participants take photos of scenes that depict their experiences, and then use them as focal points in the interviews, enabling them to discuss difficult subjects by referring to their photographs.  Because male participants are often reluctant to disclose personal information pertaining to their health conditions, photo elicitation is an ideal method for conducting qualitative research with men.  Through my Doctoral research, I will be able to provide a comparative analysis of the lived experiences of prostate cancer and testicular cancer survivors.  Insight into the ways these two diseases are experienced is key to understanding how men react and cope with illness, what their needs are for after-care treatment, and what measures need to be taken to ensure men seek routine medical exams."
Social interactions in relation to bilingual development of deaf children learning signed and spoken languages in an inclusive setting,"['Squires, Bonita']",['N/A'],"['Bilingual Language Development', 'Cognitive Development', 'Deafness', 'Language Acquisition', 'Sign Language', 'Social Development']",17500.0,225087,"Deaf children in the Maritimes are educated in an inclusive educational system designed for hearing students, supported through the services of interpreters. Typically, these students receive limited exposure to skilled signers due to their lack of daily contact with the Deaf community and the fact that the interpreters and parents whose signing they are exposed to on a daily basis are rarely native signers. They also receive drastically reduced exposure to the spoken language surrounding them due to their hearing loss and the severe limitations of learning English through speech reading. Consequently, these children experience delayed acquisition of both signed and spoken languages. Along with reduced levels of language input and learning comes a reduction in access to information and meaningful interactions with peers, which are crucial for appropriate social and cognitive development. In this study, I will assess the American Sign Language and English abilities of deaf children in the Maritimes and look for connections between their language abilities and their meaningful social interactions. I predict that lower language abilities will correspond with less frequent and complex social interactions of deaf students with deaf and hearing same-age peers, compared to hearing children and youth. Results from this study will inform parents of deaf children and professionals working with deaf children and youth by preparing an information pamphlet and a Youtube video in ASL with English voice-over for public distribution.

The goal of this research project is to inform quality improvement programs across Canada by conducting a systematic review of inappropriate health care in Canada. Our specific research objectives are to: 1) systematically search and critically review published and grey literature for studies of inappropriate health care in Canada; 2) estimate the nature and magnitude of inappropriate health care in Canada and in its provincial and territorial jurisdictions; and 3) inform a research and action agenda for future quality improvement activities aimed at reducing inappropriate health care in Canada. Our main output will be the first-ever evidence-based compendium of inappropriate health care in Canada. From this we will develop and distribute to provincial/territorial and national governments and leaders in health care quality detailed summary reports of inappropriate health care across Canada and in their province/territory. These reports will detail both the nature and the magnitude of inappropriate health care in the jurisdiction for three core care categories: preventive care, acute care, and chronic care. We will also bring together the key stakeholders from across the country involved in health care quality. We will share with them our findings to stimulate discussions with them to inform: i) an action agenda on how to reduce inappropriate health care in Canada, and ii) a research agenda that identifies areas where future research and/or monitoring are needed in inappropriate health care in Canada."
What is the role of online support groups as a source of supportive care for 2SLGBTQ+ people diagnosed with cancer? A mixed-method study of their use and effects,"['Squires, Lauren R']",['N/A'],"['2slgbtq+', 'Cancer', 'Online Support Groups']",105000.0,458251,"People diagnosed with cancer who are Two-Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (2SLGBTQ+) often experience cancer differently from their counterparts who are cisgender and/or heterosexual. 2SLGBTQ+ people diagnosed with cancer are often forced to navigate challenges during their care related to their sexual orientation and/or gender identity, such as deciding whether it is safe to disclose their identity to their healthcare provider and being less satisfied with their cancer care. Peer support during cancer treatment and beyond is an integral part of the cancer care system, and online support groups (OSGs) could serve to connect 2SLGBTQ+ people diagnosed with cancer with like-minded peers. However, such supports for 2SLGBTQ+ people specifically are lacking. Therefore, the main objective of my proposed research is to assess the role of OSGs in meeting the unique needs of 2SLGBTQ+ people diagnosed with cancer. To meet this objective, I will conduct a review of the literature and English-language OSGs that currently exist for 2SLGBTQ+ people diagnosed with cancer to assess their characteristics. I will then distribute an online survey to a diverse group of 2SLGBTQ+ people diagnosed with cancer to investigate their level of OSG use and whether OSGs have met their needs. I will then interview online survey participants who indicated an interest in being interviewed. These interviews will assess participants' thoughts, feelings, and opinions regarding cancer OSGs for 2SLGBTQ+ people and what can be done to optimize them in the future. An advisory committee of 2SLGBTQ+ people diagnosed with cancer will be involved at all steps of the project. Access to supports in the form of communities of like-minded individuals who understand their unique cancer needs and experiences is extremely important for 2SLGBTQ+ people diagnosed with cancer. My proposed research will provide important evidence on how to optimize OSGs for this community specifically."

The health sector contributes approximately 25% of all reported workplace-related violent incidents. The world currently faces a dire health worker crisis, in terms of staffing shortages, burnout and attrition. This crisis has major consequences for health service access and availability globally. Rising violence and a lack of protections for HCWs are potential contributors to these challenges. There is a major gap in understanding emerging forms of violence against health workers. These forms of violence are seemingly shaped by multiple, interconnected contextual factors, including growing societal polarization, mistrust of health workers, and evolving geopolitical trends, including those pertaining to conflict. These emergent and life-threatening forms of violence, occurring in both workplace and non-workplace settings, include kidnapping, murder, and physical assault by non-state actors, such as militant organizations. These types of violent events appear to be more common in certain low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs), even in non-conflict-affected settings, but often linked to broader socio-economic, political and security-related reasons.

This proposal aims to initiate planning for a program of work that explores global trends, drivers, and policy responses to violence against health care workers, and develops a case study of violence against these workers in Nigeria, a country that has experienced a wave of these types of events in recent years. The activities to be sponsored by this grant include a rapid sense-making appraisal of current literature, as well as virtual and physical meetings with Nigeria research partners and knowledge users. The activities sponsored by this grant will facilitate a CIHR Project Grant on this topic within one calendar year."

This proposed research examines the complex interrelationships of socioeconomic status, the life course, and health service delivery contexts to health.  In addition to generating evidence of the individual- and family-level contributors to inequities in health among children, we seek to investigate the role of institutions, and health care services specifically, in the widening of inequities among children as they age, whether these differ by gender and whether these relationships differ between countries.   This proposal addresses three broad research questions.  The first examines the pattern of inequities in health and health care among children over time in Canada; and the second assesses the causal pathways, and the role of health care in particular, that explain the widening of inequities as children age.  The third stage of research is to establish research linkages across Canada and the United Kingdom - two countries with a long-held interest in promoting a healthy and fair society - in order to investigate the relationship between inequitable utilization of health services (i.e. a distribution of health services toward those with socioeconomic advantage), and health inequities among children and adolescents. This research agenda is important for policymakers who are interested in pathways to improving population health equity.  This project will generate new evidence on how health inequities develop among children across time, and on the extent that the health system contributes to the widening or reducing of inequities over time."

Speech-language delays are associated with poorer mental health status, which may contribute to poor mental health outcomes in Aboriginal communities.
The ""Northern Oral Language and Writing through Play"" project is in year 2/7.  It is designed to address the literacy achievement gap between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. In conducting this research, it was noted that many children appeared to present with speech-language needs beyond what could be supported in the classroom. Aboriginal parents and leaders have voiced frustration about culturally inappropriate assessments of children's speech-language abilities, as well as over- and under-identification of needs. It is thought that Speech-Language Pathologists may be misidentifying language delay/disorder due to poor ability to distinguish between dialect and disorder.  
A Dynamic Assessment (DA) has been developed in the United Kingdom. It aims to distinguish children with speech-language needs requiring specialist intervention from those that simply need additional support from teachers and other adults.  DA looks at a child's capacity to learn language and is thus a valuable tool for distinguishing between dialect and disorder.  
The purpose of this grant application is to fund the creation of a play-based DA for use with Aboriginal children when they enter school. The assessment will be created in collaboration with First Nation community members/education staff who can provide linguistic, cultural and health information about their communities. Further grant funding will be sought to fund the piloting of this project in a larger number of First Nations communities as we recognize the diversity across communities. Additionally, funding will be sought for the development of a language-rich curriculum designed to support children who do not require specialist services."

The historical project also analyzes the role of international networks that facilitated the forced migration of this group of approximately 600 neurologists, psychiatrists and other medical researchers and clinicians, as well as their integration into North American neuroscience centers, the reciprocal changes of these research settings and the ways, how they were locally modified.  By applying a cultural view to neuroscience history, the project gives new insights into the nature of progressive and regressive factors of individual forms of research organization, the development of institutional models and their impact on modern neuroscience, thus contributing to the advancement of ELSI knowledge in medicine and providing historical information for use among respective stakeholders (researchers, administrators, organizational leaders) in the Canadian and International Neurosciences.  This project investigates some major institutional settings and patterns of migration and adaptation in North American neuroscience between 1910 (when the first interdisciplinary neuroscience centres emerged in Europe) and 1970 (when the Society of Neuroscience had its first US meeting), in order to determine its receptiveness to external impulses and its permeability for foreign researchers and physicians."

We will also observe family members' experiences of their interactions with home care nurses, as well as how patients' expectations (e.g., a desire to stay at home) impact these experiences. Some research to date indicates that not all individuals are comfortable with empowerment approaches, although this remains to be confirmed in palliative situations. For instance, the stress of coping with a family member's terminal illness may increase a desire to place trust in health care professionals; in addition, home care nurses may be less likely to download responsibilities to palliative families (who may be seen as more vulnerable). To answer our questions, we will analyze data from observations of the delivery of home-based care nursing services (150 hours in total), supplemented by interviews with 15 observed home care practitioners, 15 family members and 10 patients.  This research can help improve home care nursing practice with patients and families, enhancing its effectiveness and ensuring that it provides appropriate kinds of support tailored to individual needs.

In 2014, there were 16, 238 migrant caregivers in Canada. Although the evidence is limited, studies show that migrant caregivers face unique challenges compared to other temporary foreign migrant workers often based on the gendered nature of their care work. Further, they are at risk for mental health concerns because of their precarious migration status, often substandard working and living conditions and fear of repatriation. Recent changes to the Caregiver Program have meant that migrant caregivers no longer have access to permanent resident status after 24 months of paid employment, rendering their migration status even more uncertain. Indeed, our recent study in Ontario targeting this group found that migrant caregivers experienced mental distress, workplace abuse, lack of social support, and access barriers to care. A multi-faceted, inclusive approach is required to improve the working and living conditions of this vulnerable group and ultimately enhance their health outcomes. The overarching goal of this planning project is to build a cross provincial interdisciplinary and multi-sectorial research team with the intention to develop a team grant to better promote migrant caregivers' mental health.

Across the five years our team will provide funding, training, and mentorship opportunities to trainees who choose to use shAIRe resources. 

To show how shAIRe works, we will conduct two demonstration projects: 1) establish a National Participant Registry for Lung Health, and 2) develop and implement the CAN-LUNG score, a simple tool that will help Canadians understand their lung health. Community partners (the public, people living with lung conditions, researchers, healthcare professionals, and policy makers) will be consulted throughout all of the work we do.

There is no cure. CF is a debilitating disease affecting the whole body and impacts not only the person with CF but their entire family. To stay healthy, people with CF must take expensive medications and spend hours each day completing treatments. This is in addition to multiple doctors' visits and repeated hospitalizations, which are costly not only to the healthcare system but to people with CF and their families. 

To understand what it really costs to live with CF, we will survey people living with CF and their families to find out how much they spend on out-of-pocket costs for medications and treatments, and the time and money it costs them when they miss work or school to visit doctors, or to stay in hospital for extended periods of time. We will use name, sex, and date of birth to match survey responses on out-of-pocket costs and time to the national Registry which captures information for nearly all people living with CF in Canada, including doctor visits, procedures, hospitalizations, and medications. We will combine these sources to estimate the costs to both individuals and the healthcare system. 

There are now medicines for CF that are expected to increase the quality and length of life for people with CF by reducing hospitalizations and time spent on care. We will use survey information from people who are taking these new medicines to predict whether these medicines can lower the cost of CF for individuals and the healthcare system between now and 2035.

Quantifying the cost of CF, in terms of time and money, will help inform policies for equitable access to all CF medicines to prevent worsening gaps in health between those of higher and lower income. We will work with CF Canada, doctors, and researchers from across Canada to measure and explain the true costs of CF and to advocate for fair access of medicines in Canada."

The most common test to measure how well the lungs work requires that people forcefully empty all of the air in their lungs. As we age, this test becomes more difficult to do. We can't be sure that lower lung function in older adults means someone has lung disease, or if this is due to technical performance of the test or weaker breathing muscles (i.e., healthy aging). This makes it difficult to know who has lung disease. There are two large Canadian studies with very useful information that may help.

Motor vehicle crash risk after cardioverter-defibrillator implantation: A population-based evaluation,"['Staples, John A']","['Brubacher, Jeffrey R', 'Chakrabarti, Santabhanu', 'Chan, Wing-Ping H', 'Erdelyi, Shannon', 'Hawkins, Nathaniel M', 'Krahn, Andrew D']","['Clinical Epidemiology, Traffic Safety, Administrative Data']",180000.0,391242,"Motor vehicle crashes result in 1.5 million deaths and 78 million injuries worldwide each year. Some crashes can be prevented by restricting driving for individuals with medical conditions that might cause sudden incapacitation while diving (eg. epilepsy, sleep apnea). These driving restrictions are a major interruption to patients' lives and can only be justified if they prevent crashes.

About 4,000 Canadians will have an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) implanted this year. ICDs treat life-threatening cardiac rhythm abnormalities and prevent cardiac arrest. The leads that attach an ICD to the heart can cause cardiac rhythm problems soon after insertion. In theory, a lead-related heart rhythm problem or device malfunction in the weeks after implantation might occur while the patient is driving, resulting in a crash. Doctors thus warn patients not to drive for one or more weeks after ICD implantation.

How many crashes are prevented by restricting driving after ICD implantation? Is the duration of driving restriction too short, too long, or about right? Would driving restrictions be more effective if they were modified? The answers to these questions aren't known since current driving restrictions are based on small, poorly-designed studies that focus on outdated cardiac device technologies.

British Columbia's health and driving databases provide a unique opportunity to examine crash risk after ICD implantation. The MVC-ICD study will use health and driving records to compare crash risk among 7,500 ICD patients to crash risk among control patients. The data will be used to develop a score to identify patients at the highest risk of crash. Results will provide an immediate opportunity to improve clinical practice, licensing policy and road safety in Canada and abroad."

Antipsychotic medications are prescribed by doctors to improve many symptoms of schizophrenia. People with schizophrenia might also drive more safely when they are taking their antipsychotics as prescribed. Unfortunately, many people with schizophrenia do not take their medications as prescribed.

We want to know if people with schizophrenia drive more safely when they are taking their antipsychotics as prescribed. British Columbia's (BC's) unique health and driving databases can be used to study this issue.

We will complete a research study using health and driving records from BC residents who were involved in a serious car crash between 2000 and 2016. Names, birth dates and other identifying information will be removed before we look at the data. We will focus on car crashes that were bad enough to be reported to the police, including crashes in which someone was seriously injured or killed. We will assess whether people with schizophrenia are less likely to be responsible for a car crash if they are taking their antipsychotic medications as prescribed.

The results of our study will be used by doctors to give the best possible advice about driving for people with schizophrenia. Our results will also be used by experts to create rules that can prevent traffic injuries among people with schizophrenia and improve safety for everyone on the road."

The AMC have always recognized that health information, knowledge and research is critical when it comes to accessing funding, influencing government policy or assessing the effectiveness of policies, services, programs, or public health interventions that effect Manitoba First Nations (MFNs). In pursuing governance of health information and research we recognize the need to build the infrastructure of a statistical institute to collect, analyze, translate and disseminate the information as absolutely necessary if we are to make any improvements in our state of health. The AMC research team has worked towards this vision through the following journey: 

1.In 1996 AMC received mandate through Chiefs in Assembly to carry out the Regional Health Survey (RHS), the only national survey across Canada that is First Nations designed, developed and delivered on-reserve.

Female veterans make up a relatively small proportion of all CAF veterans and, until very recently, we have been limited in our ability to assess the mental health status of female CAF veterans independently from male veterans. We also do not know whether female veterans access mental health services through their provincial health care system differently than male veterans. I will use routinely-collected, provincial administrative health care data from 25,000 validated CAF veterans who released from the CAF after 1995 to develop sex-specific prevalence estimates of mental health disorders and comorbid conditions amongst CAF veterans in Ontario. I will also identify and compare patterns of mental health service utilization amongst cohorts of male and female CAF veterans. This project will generate new information about sex-specific differences in the mental health status of CAF veterans, which is needed to determine the types of services that will improve the mental well-being of male and female CAF veterans. I will also describe how male and female CAF veterans access mental health services through the provincial health care system, which will influence policies and improve pathways to care."

Sexual health includes having control over one's sexual and reproductive choices, as well as having access to enjoyable and safe sexual relationships free of shame, coercion and violence. The ongoing impact of colonization on Indigenous peoples has resulted in the loss of traditional teachings and knowledge around intimacy, rites of passage ceremonies, and individual/collective roles and responsibilities which contributed to the development of healthy relationships, the backbone of community resilience. This project acknowledges that cultural and sexual identities are complex processes of identity development, and particularly complex for urban Indigenous youth who may have already experienced life challenges stemming from colonial violence and historical trauma. It is within this context that the project seeks to engage youth across the gender-identity spectrum, which is inclusive of all gender expressions. Through Indigenous storytelling and Youth Participatory Action Research with Indigenous youth across the gender-identity spectrum, Elders, knowledge holders, and front-line workers this project aims to create a wholistic framework for culturally safe and relevant programming that supports sexual health, identity and belonging among urban Indigenous youth in Calgary, addressing a critical gap in the services for urban Indigenous youth across the gender-identity spectrum."

The good news is that Haiti's food landscape is changing. In 2019, the Haitian government set a food security agenda that includes food sovereignty, a vision that prioritizes democratic control over food, healthy populations alongside healthy ecosystems, and gender inclusive food systems. With this new wave of agro-food planning in Haiti, we want to be sure that food security is gender-inclusive. Our research is guided by two questions: How can we integrate context-specific community knowledges with gender inequity and food security assessment tools to identify contextually, and gender-specific food and health needs? How can we utilize a new gender-inclusive food security and health assessment tools to mobilize gender-inclusive programming in food security and health?
Our researchers have extensive experience in food security, and community health, in Haiti, and the UniversitÃ© d'Ãtat d'Haiti, Limonade (UEH-L) offers a local partner already supporting agrarian development and food security. In June 2019, a team of Canadian researchers met with over 25 Haitian community-based organizations to identify prospects of gender-inclusive food security, and health planning in Haiti. That group articulated a need for a gendered Integrated Knowledge Translation (iKT) approach to understand how food security and health challenges in Haiti are gendered. In response, this project will develop and pilot a gender-inclusive food security and health (GFSH) assessment tool."

The burden of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) like chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis are exceedingly high among Inuit with rates higher than ten times the national average. The rates of STIs, along with limited access to healthcare (such as anonymous HIV testing), isolation, harsh climate among other issues like addictions, poverty, domestic violence and mental health are considerable risk factors for HIV infections in Inuit populations. The purpose of this grant is to bring together a renewed research team involving members of Pauktuutit Inuit Women Association of Canada, Dalhousie University School of Nursing, Canadian Aboriginal Aids Networks and key stakeholders from Inuit communities in Nunavut for a three day grant writing retreat and partnership building gathering. The aim of this retreat is to address an important Federal Initiative on Aboriginal health, which would involve developing a program of research to address the complex issues related to HIV and AIDs among Inuit people, with a specific focus on education, prevention and treatment. As a team, we are concerned about the continual threat of a HIV epidemic in Inuit communities. Recognizing that mass screening and testing for HIV in Inuit communities is not presently an option we feel that it is important to turn our attention to education and prevention activities in an effort to reach Inuit populations."

In British Columbia (BC), there are over 300 Indigenous communities, collectives and organizations (ICCOs) and 27 Research Ethics Boards (REBs). Our goal is to improve Indigenous health research ethics processes in BC to be more culturally safe and aligned with Indigenous knowledges and distinctions-based guidelines. Our aims are to: 1) Conduct a scoping review to identify wise practices and ethical guidelines used by ICCOs and REBs in Indigenous health research; 2) Explore the perspectives of research ethics partners on gaps, barriers, and experiences in Indigenous health research ethics; and 3) Facilitate a convening space for ethics partners to co-create solutions and resources to improve Indigenous health research ethics. Data collection includes interviews, sharing circles, and graphic recording. This Indigenous-led project leverages partnerships with BC Network Environment for Indigenous Health Research, First Nations Health Authority, Research Ethics BC, BC Provincial Health Officer, ICCOs, and universities. Outcomes include: 1) A digital repository of ICCO and REB ethical guidelines and wise practices; 2) Co-developed resources to improve Indigenous research ethics; 3) Calls to Action for Indigenizing health research ethics; 4) A BC Indigenous health research ethics network of scholars, ethics partners, and ICCOs; and 5) New evidence for the ethical review of Indigenous health ethics applications.

A gendered perspective on healthy equity: Protective health practices and equitable access to local built environments,"['Stenberg, Keely A']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,400479,"The prevalence of chronic disease in Canada is a growing concern. Individual engagement in healthy behaviours (e.g., physical activity, healthy eating, medical screenings, etc.) can help to prevent the onset of chronic diseases. Adult engagement in healthy behaviours, however, is relatively low in Canada and may be moderated by factors outside of individuals' control, such as the built environment. Further, normalized behaviour patterns have created environments that disproportionately limit women's opportunities to fully participate in a range of healthy behaviours. Women, particularly, can experience avoidable and unfair barriers to engaging in healthy behaviours due to socialized gender norms such as household and care-taking responsibilities. From a critical feminist perspective, this proposed doctoral research aims to understand gendered experiences in the built environment related to health behaviours. A multi-method approach will be utilized to gather data on the perceptions and lived experience of adult women, as well as an assessment of the economic, physical, political, and social aspects of their local environment. This presentation will provide an outline of the proposed research including a hypothesis, timeline, and budget. This research intends to contribute to the limited literature that focuses on gendered experiences that impact health behaviours in the built environment. Specifically, it is anticipated that the findings will be used to draw attention to women's opportunities to engage in health behaviours that protect against chronic diseases and highlight aspects of the built environment that dictate these experiences. Recommendations will be made to both research and practice communities to assist in remediating barriers women face due to the features or characteristics of the built environments in which they live."

The absence of a specific solid tumour site and the typically chronic disease course set the stage for critical interpersonal interactions within a highly complicated and rapidly changing health care environment. Haematological patients may face intense diagnostic and treatment regimens, increased risk for secondary disease, palliation, and end-of-life care decision-making. Although clinical experience and a small body of available research indicate these differences will influence the care communication environment, there is little research into the critical role that health care communication can play in shaping patient care and outcomes. 

Beginning with secondary analysis, this study will examine data collected from over 260 mixed oncology patients over the past decade by the UBC Cancer Care Communication Program to explore similarities and differences in communication experience between general oncology and haematology patients. Interview data has been coded in both NVivoâ¢ and MS Excelâ¢ and the secondary analysis will be approached using Interpretive Description. This applied qualitative methodology seeks to generate an analytical framework within which emerging themes such as decision making, information interpretation, sense-making, and sustainment of emotional support systems within a shifting world can be explored and interpreted. Rigorous analysis will illuminate the complex challenges associated with effective interactions. Thematic secondary analysis will inform additional data collection through focused interviews with a new haematological patient cohort.

Men who work in high risk industries such as construction, mining, fish harvesting, forestry and who work with electricity may experience the greatest risk of workplace injuries (both physical and psychological). Men's behaviour at the workplace may be influenced by cultural expectations to be tough and fearless in the face of risk and danger, as well as economic incentives to complete work quickly, which can lead to less of a focus on occupational health and safety. 

Despite the human, health and economic costs associated with men's occupational injuries, there is currently very little understanding of the best methods and strategies for improving health and safety practices at workplaces which employ men in high risk work. To develop best practice strategies, our cross Canada team of researchers, health and safety partners and organizations will study high risk occupations such as construction, forestry, fish harvesting and electrical work. This will include: 1) reviewing accident reports to understand what risks are most significant to men; 2) examining workplace health and safety policies and practices in high risk work environments and 3) interviewing workers, employers, unions and health and safety personnel to understand how each group learns about, understands and manages workplace risks. We will use what we learn from our studies to develop practical health and safety tools and educational programs to enhance men's health and safety at the workplace."

These outcomes are sometimes referred to as posttraumatic growth and are associated with a number of personal and social characteristics as well as coping and cognitive processing or appraisal strategies. Research studies have shown that the use of a cognitive processing approach identified as rumination, may be related to experiencing both posttraumatic distress and posttraumatic growth. Our study is designed to explore the role of rumination in mediating the overall relationship between posttraumatic stress and posttraumatic growth in sexual assault survivors as well as to examine some of the cognitive processing strategies associated with reducing post-assault distress. Specifically we focus on two forms of rumination, i.e., intrusive and negative rumination and deliberate and positive rumination and explore their association with posttraumatic mental health outcomes in sexual assault. Our previous clinical work demonstrates that deliberate and positive rumination, clearly differentiated from intrusive and negative rumination, is associated with posttraumatic growth following sexual assault. We aim to demonstrate that skills to implement this form of rumination can be acquired through cognitive behavioural intervention strategies. 
     This research addresses the critically important area of posttraumatic mental health in sexual assault survivors. The high rates and negative personal, social and economic costs of sexual assault are well known.

Of those individuals that are HIV-positive, children account for a high percentage of existing cases, with most of these children living in resource-poor countries.  To date, there has been little to no research focused on disability and rehabilitation in this vulnerable population in any region of the world.  Thus, this research is novel, and proposes to exam the experiences of children who are living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa and Canada, to ascertain their experiences, functional, and participatory limitations from a disability and rehabilitation point of view.  Various research methods will be employed to answer the research questions, and may include review of the existing literature, interviews with children and their families, focus groups and participant observation.  The resulting data will be analyzed using a critical approach, and the results will be shared with the research participants and their families.  In addition, the results will be presented at various international health and disability conferences, and will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals for publication.  By gaining a better understanding of the issues related to disability and rehabilitation in children living with HIV, both in Canada and sub-Saharan Africa, this research serves to provide new information to further advance the global efforts to combat HIV."

FASD, a complex and lifelong disability, requires attention and interventions from a range of sectors including health, social services, education and justice. Without effective community supports, individuals can experience crisis and negative contact with sectors across the lifespan. FASD is understood to be a highly stigmatized disability that follows a racialized script. While FASD is not isolated to specific ethnic groups, misconceptions about prevalence and compounding factors of racism requires research and practices that are culturally safe. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Calls to Action note FASD in Call #33 and #34 and the need for intersectoral collaboration and Indigenous consultation. A nuanced investigation of FASD must account for race, class and gender but also the ongoing impacts of colonialism. Research on FASD must be attentive to the needs of Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities alike. Accordingly, the proposed project will focus on hosting regional meetings to develop a consultative and collaborative framework to launch a community-driven Social Determinants of Heath (SDOH) project on FASD. An SDOH framework investigates root causes of health inequity which can link health-based research to social justice issues-and by extension result in more suitable interventions.

Specifically, children, families, clinicians and decision makers will be interviewed to find out what factors are most important to measure the quality of mental health care children, youth and their families receive.  In addition to engaging key stakeholders to determine the most important indicators to capture outcomes known to be relevant to domains of quality in children's mental health, we will ensure that these indicators are feasible to improve practice by testing them with a large, existing comprehensive database within Canada. We will also examine the impact of sex and gender on recovery rates with these specific QIs. To make sure the indicators can provide a fair comparison of quality across organizations, statistical approaches will be developed to account for differences in important clinical issues that exist across regional jurisdictions and between service providers. This innovative approach will be instrumental to foster improvements in service prioritization and triaging, policy, care planning and allocation of resources. This approach will also enable mental health care professionals to target areas for improvement and implement interventions to facilitate improved quality of care to optimize the mental health and well-being of our most vulnerable young Canadians."

Four speakers with research expertise in antisocial behavior in girls and women (i.e., conduct disorder, aggression, substance abuse) will speak on the factors motivating these behaviors in females.  Does the high co-morbidity of conduct disorder and substance use disorders with psychiatric disorders such as depression in adolescent girls suggest that these apparently externalizing behaviours are motivated by internalizing problems such as sadness?  Or is there more evidence for antisocial behaviours in girls being motivated by similar processes as in boys (e.g., aggression motivated by anger)?  Alternatively, are antisocial girls and women a heterogeneous group with distinct motivations for their antisocial behaviour (e.g., school truancy motivated by anxiety in some, and by defiance in others)?  The objectives of the CafÃ© are to (1) increase awareness of the prevalence and costs associated with ""bad"" behaviours in girls such as aggression, conduct disorder, and substance abuse; (2) share and discuss recent scientific information regarding the potential causes of these externalizing behaviours in girls, with a focus on whether or not the motivational underpinnings are distinct in girls vs. boys; and (3) examine the issue from a developmental perspective through additional consideration of what factors motivate criminal and antisocial behaviours in adult women.

Worldwide, shocking numbers of individuals are not adhering to such public health measures [11]. And some who are adhering appropriately appear very psychologically distressed in response to these viral containment measures [4]. Emerging adults are particularly likely to engage in risky behaviors [15] and to fail to comply with public health recommendations [11]. Little is known about factors that contribute to non-adherence or distress in response to such public health measures; research from prior pandemics suggests that personality factors may be involved [4]. Knowledge about who is least likely to adhere to public health recommendations, thereby increasing societal risk, would be particularly beneficial in knowing where to target limited university student services resources. Similarly, knowledge about who is most likely to experience distress can be useful in planning who to target for distress management services. The proposed study will examine links of four established personality risk factors for substance misuse [16] to degree of adherence/distress to COVID-19 public health containment measures; and determine whether personality-targeted motivational and skills-building interventions already established as effective for substance misuse [6] might also be effective for improving adherence/distress to public health measures. The study will take place at 5 university sites across Canada in collaboration with Student Services at each site.  First, a survey will be sent out to undergrads at each site. Next, interventions will be delivered to high-risk students either in person or online, with each compared to a control group receiving access to usual student support services only. Results could have important implications for service delivery on campus to help with the public health response to COVID-19."

We recently showed that problem gamblers show worse work performance than others in part because they engage in more gambling-specific cyberloafing. We will follow up this finding in several ways. First, our prior work may underestimate the extent of cyberloafing since it is based on self-report. In our proposed study with 120 gamblers employed half-time or more, we will use mobile sensing technology on people's smartphones to track what they are doing on their cell phones (e.g., gambling, social media, blogging) both while they are at work and outside of work. We will also look on a day-to-day basis to see if days that a person does more gambling-specific cyberloafing are associated with poorer work performance and engagement, and whether such day-to-day associations are stronger in certain people (e.g., men or more impulsive people). We will also go beyond work outcomes to look at impacts on mental health (e.g., depression, anxiety, and stress). We also intend to look at the reasons underlying cyberloafing to see if outcomes are worse if an employee is engaging in gambling-specific cyberloafing to cope with stress. Finally, we hope to determine to what degree ""absorption"" (becoming fully immersed in an activity) might explain how gambling-specific cyberloafing has such damaging effects on work and mental health. We are a multidisciplinary team of researchers consisting of clinical and forensic psychologists, industrial/organizational psychologists, and psychiatric researchers with expertise in problem gambling, mental health, remote sensing, personality, motives, and work engagement/performance, who will tackle these crucial and timely questions. Answers will have important implications for employers, the public, and therapists for establishing helpful workplace policies, preventative education, and novel clinical interventions."

Toronto has Canada's largest Indigenous population, with thousands of Indigenous youth and families searching for jobs, education, and homes, often ending up stuck in cycles of couch surfing, staying in emergency shelters, or sleeping on the streets. Current homeless services focus on crisis mental health programs; this project will move the focus to interventions that prevent homelessness and strengthen individuals' chances of successfully exiting the streets. There is a lack of evaluation data in homeless services generally and specifically in Indigenous mental health programs. In partnership with Toronto's Indigenous providers of mental health to the Indigenous homeless, Dr. Stewart and her team will develop and evaluate culturally based evidence-based programs to improve the mental health by preventing homelessness and at the same time creating better outcomes for those trying to exit the cycle. The project will document the use and experiences of cultural mental health care for the Indigenous homeless through research that uses surveys and individual interviews with mental health providers and their patients; focus groups with Indigenous Elders and Healers will also be conducted to identify culturally based solutions. An Indigenous knowledges evaluation framework will be developed. Based on findings, toolkits for policymakers, texts on evidence-based Indigenous mental health models, and curriculum for training health care workers will be published."

Indigenous Elders and older adults are integral to cultural revitalization, building intergenerational connections, and sharing knowledges. They are living longer lives than ever before, yet still do not have equitable access to healthcare that promotes wellbeing, especially into later life. Indigenous older adults are more likely to have chronic health conditions compared to non-Indigenous Canadians, and when intensive health services are needed, moving to a long term care (LTC) facility may be necessary. These relocations separate Indigenous older adults from family, friends, community, and culture. Research on Indigenous older adults residing in LTC homes in Canada is sparse. This program of research comprises of three separate but related studies which will contribute to a foundation of knowledge on the topic and answer the following research questions: 1) What culturally appropriate supports and services do Indigenous older adults identify to be important for aging well in LTC? 2) What are the current demographics of the Indigenous older adult population living in LTC in Canada? 3) What are the experiences of Indigenous older adults who move from their communities to a LTC home? The studies use a range of research methods: Question 1 conducts a comprehensive systematic review; Question 2 performs a secondary data analysis on Indigenous LTC resident data from a Canadian LTC database; and Question 3 applies narrative and Storywork methods to explore Indigenous older adult residents' experiences of living in LTC and their perceptions on the necessities for aging well. Findings from these studies have a wide range of applications and can be used to inform healthcare providers, policymakers, and LTC facilities about supporting and promoting the health and wellbeing of Indigenous older adult residents."

Older HIV-positive adults deserve equitable health and social environments in order to optimize their physical and mental health, creating the conditions that would permit full participation in society.  The proposed project seeks to lay the groundwork to examine the intersections of HIV, stigma, and aging in Canada to better understand the aging experience of this population. This work will seek to coordinate Canadian research activities in this field and inform policies related to aging and health and population health interventions focused on older adults. These planning activities will involve collaboration among research, advocacy, and policy spheres, leading to a research program that advances the existing literature and informs evidence-based responses. Guided by the research literature and stakeholder input, this project will yield a set of prioritized research questions pertaining to psychosocial impacts and support needs of HIV-positive older adults in Canada.

The intersection of age and gender identity/sexual orientation is an important consideration given the potential for layering of ageism with discrimination. Multiple layers of stigma can act as barriers to participating in society, employment and volunteer opportunities, accessing services, and receiving appropriate healthcare. Research from outside of Canada has reported disparities in health between older LGBT individuals and their non-LGBT peers, including less access to healthcare and the negative effects of stigmatization on physical and mental health. Evidence points to a critical role of social networks and, more specifically, support and care networks, among LGBT older adults. Among majority populations, a relationship has been shown between these networks and health outcomes. This project will generate a portrait of health inequalities of lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) older adults in Canada as well as describe the care and support networks of this group.  It will examine the role of support and care networks in reducing health inequalities among LGB individuals in view of developing inclusive policy and practice approaches that address the needs of LGB older adults and their networks.  The study will draw upon Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) baseline data from Comprehensive and Tracking cohorts.  It is hypothesized that 1) older LGB individuals will exhibit poor self-rated health and poor mental health relative to non-LGB peers; 2) care relationships among LGB individuals will be composed of non-biological family members; and 3) indicators of social support will moderate the effect of LGB identity on health outcomes such that participants with greater social capital will exhibit fewer health inequalities."

The Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) is a national population health study that will follow approximately 50,000 adults aged 45-85 over the next 20 years. At baseline, 1,057 community-dwelling participants (i.e., 2%) within the CLSA self-identified as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB). The purpose of this presentation is to examine differences in mental health between LGB and heterosexual participants in the CLSA. Depressive symptoms were evaluated through the short form of the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression (CES-D10) scale. Results indicated that LGB participants had greater odds of being categorized as depressed. In addition, gay and bisexual males were found to have lower levels of perceived social support relative to heterosexual males. Results highlight the importance of mental health services for aging sexual minorities in order to support a diverse aging population. Following the mental health trajectories of minority participants in the CLSA as they reach older ages will be essential to better understanding the relationship between the social determinants of health and aging in Canada. These data are important to promoting healthy aging in the community for diverse segments of the older adult population in Canada. Participation at this international conference will foster collaborations which may lead to larger, cross-national initiatives to promote healthy aging for LGB older adults."
Healthy 2SLGBTQI+ older adults and communities: Addressing inequalities and promoting health equity,"['Stinchcombe, Arne']",['N/A'],"['2slgbtqi+', 'Aging', 'Cognition', 'Gender Identity', 'Health Equity', 'Mental Health', 'Sexual Orientation']",650000.0,498994,"While 2-spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (2SLGBTQI+) older adults share some of the experiences and concerns of all aging Canadians, theirs are also informed by a unique context of social exclusions linked to their minority sexual orientations and/or gender identities. Sexual and gender diversity are important determinants of health that have been largely overlooked in previous research on aging. The proposed research focuses on three intersecting themes: 1) Promoting mental health and reducing social isolation for 2SLGBTQI+ older adults; 2) Beyond safety: Affirming and celebratory environments to grow old; and 3) Aging bodies, aging brains. The project will adopt a community-based approach by involving 2SLGBTQI+ older adults and community organizations throughout the research process, ensuring that the research is responsive, relevant, and useful to the needs and concerns of these communities. The research aims to identify and address the health disparities that affect 2SLGBTQI+ older adults, including higher rates of depression and anxiety as well as greater risk of chronic diseases and cognitive decline. The research will also explore the unique challenges that 2SLGBTQI+ older adults face as they age, including discrimination, social isolation, and lack of access to appropriate healthcare. The research findings will have significant implications for improving the health and well-being of 2SLGBTQI+ older adults in Canada. By addressing the unique social determinants of health that affect this population, this work will help reduce health disparities and promote health equity. It will also help to raise awareness of the health needs and concerns of 2SLGBTQI+ older adults, which is an important step towards ensuring that these needs are addressed in research, policy, programs, and services. Overall, this research will contribute to creating a more inclusive and equitable society for all Canadians."

Our Partnering For Pain team recently asked hundreds of youth, families, and healthcare providers across Canada to identify their top priorities for treating chronic pain during childhood. We learned that preventing chronic pain was their #1 concern. About 1 in 5 children and teens will develop chronic pain after surgery, and many will continue to use opioids months later. This means that improving how we treat pain from surgery is an ideal and critical time to stop chronic pain before it starts. The goal of this project is to design a new hospital care team that helps to prevent the development of chronic pain in children and teens after surgery. We know that children's hospitals in Canada want a hospital care team like this, but they don't yet know how to do it well. We will talk to and partner with all groups of people who would be impacted by this new hospital care team, including youth with pain, family members, healthcare providers, and hospital leaders. We will engage them through interviews, surveys, and in-person planning meetings. This group of people will work together to decide when, where, and how the new hospital care team should be available. The group will also decide what healthcare providers are needed for the new care team, and what questions we should ask to know whether the new care team is helpful, acceptable, and ready to be adopted by other children's hospitals. What we learn will help us to plan future projects to keep improving care for youth with pain. We will also evaluate whether our partnership was successful, and share how we worked together as an example for others who want to address top priorities identified by children, teens, and their families."

Preliminary Results Examining the Inter-generational Effects of the Indian Residential School Experience Using Grounded Theory.,"['Stirbys, Cynthia D']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal Women', 'Gender-Based Analysis', 'Healing', 'Ics Travel Awards', 'Indian Residential Schools', 'Trauma']",988.0,288367,"ICS Travel Awards: 

Past research into Canada's history of the Indian residential school (IRS) assimilation policy (1879-1998) revealed that Aboriginal children were often traumatized.  Many were diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and this trauma was found to be passed onto later generations.  Research findings showed that medical professionals often viewed survivors' response to trauma from a clinical lens only and rarely considered how culture and the Indigenous holistic understanding of health would view it differently.  As a result, professionals overlook the varied experiences and the possibility that while trauma existed, many survivors were able to reframe their experiences to not only strengthen themselves but next generations as well (Denham 2008). 
My doctoral research aims to find the broader spectrum of experiences and outcomes of the IRS experience by determining: a) What is the main concern of female IRS survivors and their daughters as it relates to the IRS experience? and b) How do they continually work to resolve this concern?  I start with the assumption that variation exists in how individuals responded to the IRS experience and in the outcome and transmission of these experiences to next generations. 
Instead of using structured interviews that ask leading questions (e.g. about either psychiatric outcomes or resilience), I listen to female participants' own stories and words and then ask them more detailed questions based on their experiences.  The goal of this research is to develop a theory that comes from the experiences of IRS female survivors and their daughters that accounts for the variation in responses and outcomes.  Understanding this process by means of a theoretical framework will foster the development of culture-based tools to address family disruption and promote life opportunities. Coming from a gendered perspective, preliminary findings of this research study will be presented."

Migrants, many of whom are women of reproductive age, are held in prisons or carceral centres while awaiting processing or deportation. Healthcare provided to migrants in Canadian and international detention centres has been deemed 'sub-standard' and 'dangerous.' Reports have detailed problematic outcomes including high rates of suicidality and depression, along with stillbirths, lack of prenatal care, and reduced access to abortion services. There is a paucity of empirical evidence documenting the health outcomes and lived experiences of migrant women who have encountered detention. This study will utilize Reproductive Justice and structural violence frameworks to examine the underlying systemic drivers of health-related harm and inequity among migrant women exposed to immigrant detention, with a particular focus on sexual and reproductive and mental and health. Based out of the Centre for Gender and Sexual Health Equity, this research will leverage two ongoing mixed-methods studies involving migrant women in Vancouver and at the U.S.-Mexico border. I will analyse data collected on migration, detention, socio-structural factors, and sexual and reproductive and mental health outcomes among migrant women in Vancouver (n=250) and at the U.S.-Mexico border (n=150) using logistic GEE regression. I will also conduct qualitative interviews with women in Vancouver (n=20) and at the U.S-Mexico border (n=20) using grounded theory methodology. This research will generate urgently needed evidence on the health consequences of immigrant detention. Findings will be shared with the global community through intensive KT including publications, plain language reports, policy briefs, and media targeting health, immigration, and human rights policymakers."

Women and Extractive Industries in British Columbia: Capturing vulnerability using open data and GIS,"['Stockwell, Alison M']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2466.0,324462,"Aboriginal and rural women are among the most vulnerable members of Canadian society and are particularly vulnerable to health impacts associated with the extractive industry (EI) such as increased substance abuse, prostitution, and domestic and community violence - impacts that are often linked to the influx of a transient workforce. Yet, these impacts remain largely unidentified and unmitigated in Canadian federal and provincial EIAs. In British Columbia (BC), EI project proponents, impact assessors, reviewers, and communities themselves have open access to robust digital health and spatial datasets. These datasets can be used to identify areas and populations vulnerable to EI impacts during the EIA process, as well as track conditions over time to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures. 

This presentation details the results of a systematic narrative review of provincial EIAs that reveals how impacts related to community violence, violence against women, and associated drug and alcohol abuse are captured in EIAs in BC; and what follow-up measures are prescribed to address them. Further, it will discuss opportunities for integrating existing health and spatial datasets and web-based GIS tools to enhance the current EIA processes and applied mitigations measures through a case study in Northern BC.

This relationship varies according to where drinking takes place (e.g. a bar, public place, private home) and type of activity engaged in (e.g. driving, eating a meal). The present study will explore how injury risk changes when a person is also using some kind of stimulant, such as an ""energy drink"", cocaine or amphetamine-type drugs. Increasingly, risky substance use involves a pattern of combined alcohol and other drug use and there is evidence that this further increases the risk of injury. Canada has regulations to limit the caffeine content of alcoholic beverages. Unfortunately, most combined alcohol and energy drinks consumed in Canada are not pre-mixed and, instead, drinkers combine separate alcoholic and energy drinks. There may be a need for further regulation of energy drink in places where alcohol is sold. We propose the first controlled study of how combined alcohol and energy drink consumption increases injury risk. The team has considerable experience with emergency room studies investigating substance use and other activities immediately before their injury. One member of the team invented the ""case-crossover"" study design, which has been increasingly used in epidemiological research worldwide. We will apply this method so that individuals presenting to the ER will provide information not only on their substance use and other activities immediately before their injury or acute illness, but also, (i) at the same time the previous week, (ii) the last time they were in the particular setting in which they experienced their injury or illness. We will then estimate how risk of injury increases with increasing doses of alcohol, energy drinks and other illegal stimulants separately and in combination. We will also investigate how these estimates vary by gender, age and context of substance use. The results will be shared with policymakers and other researchers."
Does minimum pricing reduce the burden of disease and injury attributable to alcohol?,"['Stockwell, Timothy R']","['Auld, Matthew C', 'Brennan, Alan', 'Buxton, Jane', 'Giesbrecht, Norman A', 'Macdonald, Scott A', 'Meier, Petra', 'Thomas, Gerald B']","['Alcohol Related Diseases', 'Alcohol Related Trauma', 'Economics', 'Policy', 'Prevention', 'Public Health']",394686.0,190643,"Canada is one of few countries where minimum prices of alcoholic drinks are regulated by government, ostensibly to limit negative health and safety consequences of drinking. While it is well-documented that alcohol use and related problems are each strongly influenced by price, that high-risk drinkers often select the cheapest alcohol, the effectiveness of minimum pricing policies for reducing alcohol related harms remains untested. This is despite growing international interest in this public health measure and its widespread use in Canada. An international team of investigators from Canada, USA and UK will examine the effectiveness of minimum pricing regulations currently in place in British Columbia, Ontario, Alberta and Nova Scotia and appraise selected options for future modifications. A recently developed UK model which predicts the health and societal impact of minimum pricing on different population groups (e.g. young adults, heavy drinkers, teenagers) will be adapted to the Canadian context, and applied in this project as a tool for alcohol policy appraisal in Canada. The model will be refined so that it can predict the costs and benefits of minimum pricing as a public health measure in policy decision making in other jurisdictions. The basic approach will both draw upon and add to experience with modifying other risk factors for poor health, such as transfats, tobacco use and excessive salt intake with the use of price incentives."
"The potential impact of alcohol minimum unit pricing and alcoholic beverage labelling as a cancer prevention intervention in Canada, by socioeconomic status, at the national, provincial and territorial levels","['Stockwell, Timothy R', 'Cukier, Samantha']","['De Groh, Margaret', 'Halligan, Michelle', 'McEachern, Julie', 'Thomas, Gerald B', 'Hobin, Erin P', 'Naimi, Timothy', 'Sherk, Adam N', 'Shield, Kevin D']","['Alcohol And Cancer', 'Alcohol Minimum Unit Pricing', 'Alcohol Policy In Canada', 'Alcohol Policy Modelling', 'Alcohol-Caused Cancer Incidence', 'Alcohol-Caused Cancer Mortality', 'Burden Of Disease Studies', 'Estimating The Impact Of Alcohol Policy Change On Cancer', 'Labelling Alcohol Products With Cancer Warnings', 'Provincial And Territorial Alcohol Policy']",,460176,"Cancer is the leading cause of death among Canadians and alcohol plays an important causal role in incidence and mortality of some cancers. About 5.5% of cancer deaths would not have occurred in the absence of alcohol use, this is over 4,400 deaths per year. In both low volume and heavy drinkers, alcohol results in a substantial number of cancer cases and deaths. 

Two promising alcohol policies towards reducing alcohol use and related cancer harm are minimum unit pricing (MUP) and health warning labels. An MUP, which stops the sale of very cheap ethanol, has been shown to reduce alcohol use in Scotland, Wales, Saskatchewan and BC. Labelling, focusing on the alcohol-cancer link, increases consumer knowledge that alcohol causes cancer and to may decrease per capita drinking among labelled products.

We will evaluate the potential health impact of introducing MUP and cancer warning labelling as a cancer prevention strategy and the differential impacts across provinces and different SES groups. We have previously led studies evaluating the impact of MUP and product labelling on drinking and related harms; we will extend these studies to all provinces and territories, and measure the impact on cancer incidence and mortality.

All analyses will be conducted by two socioeconomic dimensions: gender and household income. Household income analyses will build upon on previous work at our institute, which began to untangle the Alcohol Harms Gradient - the phenomenon that, on average, people with lower levels of income drink less but experience higher rates of alcohol-caused harms. This has important implications for alcohol policy in Canada.

Tailored, jurisdiction-specific knowledge translation and exchange products will be distributed through CISUR's extensive network of federal, provincial and territorial policymakers and will leverage CISUR's community of practice network for our ongoing Canadian Alcohol Policy Evaluation (CAPE) project."

Given that women comprise one-third of injectors globally but shoulder a disproportionate HIV burden, interventions must consider how gender shapes the application and impact of police enforcement on HIV outcomes. Women who inject drugs (WID) face multi-level interpersonal, social, and structural vulnerabilities that increase their risk of drug-related harm, but little is known about how police enforcement activities shape HIV risks and health adversity in general among WID. This project will contribute to HIV prevention and treatment expansion efforts by identifying whether gender modifies the link between police enforcement and HIV risk, prevention and treatment outcomes, elucidating how policing shapes key HIV outcomes, and quantifying the potential impact of eliminating punitive police enforcement practices on the expansion of ART among WID. This mixed-methods research will draw on pooled quantitative data from two studies I lead on as PI and co-PI: the Women Speak Out study, the largest representative dataset of WID in Southeast Asia, and the Jakarta Peer-Driven Intervention study, a community-led treatment intervention exploring determinants of HIV among PID. Additional original qualitative data will be collected from WID in urban sites in Indonesia. This study will be the first to explore how police enforcement activities shape access and utilization of HIV prevention and treatment in the region. Employing integrated knowledge translation, this study will shift the research field from identifying gender-related health disparities related to police enforcement towards informing appropriate interventions to reduce them."

While waiting for a vaccine, governments are using a number of policies that focus on changing people behaviour to stop the spread of the virus. However, for these policies to work and stop the spread of COVID-19 and improve the economy, people need to actually do (adhere to) the recommendations. For people to adhere to these policies they need: 1) to be aware of the policies; 2) see the policies as important; and 3) feel able to actually do the things they are being asked to do. All of these 3 things are influenced by where people are from, who they are, their current health, and the environment around them. Unfortunately, policies have changed over time and the exact polices and how people are told about the policies (messaging) varies greatly between and within countries. This has led to uncertainty among people about what is behind the government decisions and confusion about which policies to follow. 
The iCARE Study is a global survey that captures data on peoples' awareness, attitudes, and behaviours in relation to COVID-19 policies. We also ask how the pandemic is impacting peoples' physical and mental health, economic situation, and quality of life. In addition to over 70,000 survey responses, we collect data on number of cases and deaths, information about policies across different countries, and how people are moving about in their countries. These data will be linked and analysed together to understand which government policies are (or are not) influencing population behaviour, and in whom these policies are most or least effective. Of note, iCARE study has significant impact, and has been working directly with the government of Canada (supervisor Lavoie is on federal COVID-19 advisory board), as well as the governments of Ireland and Australia."
Exploring the effects of sedentary behaviour and physical activity on healthy ageing through an individual patient data meta-analysis: Harmonization of international longitudinal studies,"['Stojanovic, Jovana']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,411995,"Recent demographic estimates showed that global population is ageing. Individuals over 60 years of age have more than doubled in numbers from 1980 to 2017, and these figures are expected to double again by 2050, reaching a staggering figure of 2.1 billion older persons. 
Even though there is emerging evidence that high levels of sedentary behaviour (SB) are detrimental, older populations spend around 9.4 hours per day in a sedentary state, and many of them do not engage in recommended physical activity (PA) levels.
There is an on-going debate whether current guidelines on PA are appropriate for the aging population. In that sense, it would be extremely important to provide citizens with appropriate advice on the necessary amounts and modalities of PA and SB that would lead to meaningful health benefits. Disability-free life expectancy incorporates mortality and disability together, and has been considered as a crucial population health indicator for exploring whether the extra years lived have been spent in good or poor health. We will perform an Individual Patient Data (IPD) meta-analysis and use existing international longitudinal studies in order to identify minimal levels and patterns of SB and PA elderly individuals will need to engage in to increase DFLE by 2 years. IPD meta-analysis uses actual data from multiple cohort studies, rather than using data information taken from published articles alone. Before performing the IPD meta-analysis, complex retrospective data harmonization needs to be performed in order to integrate multiple datasets together, making provided information comparable to each other. Moreover, we will explore how the effects of these behaviours vary across populations of different age, sex, gender, ethnic background, and social status."
Developing strategies and resources to support patient and family engagement with racialized immigrant older adults,"['Stolee, Paul']","['Arya, Akshaya N', 'Elliott, Jacobi B', 'Grindrod, Kelly A', 'Lopez, Kimberly J', 'Sims-Gould, Joanie', 'Tong, Catherine E']","['Immigration', 'Older Adults', 'Patient Engagement', 'Shared Decision-Making']",229500.0,435085,"One in three older Canadians were born elsewhere. Immigrant older adults, in particular those who are racialized (i.e., non-White), are more likely to report chronic conditions (e.g., heart disease, diabetes) but face greater challenges understanding and accessing the health care system. This is due to issues of language, awareness of the health care system, and discrimination. We know that patient and family engagement can lead to improved health. Patient and family engagement can be achieved by developing meaningful relationships; developing trust between patients and providers; and improving communication between patients and providers. No Canadian studies have specifically examined patient engagement with immigrant older adults. We know that this type of research must be multilingual, and we will conduct this project in Mandarin, Cantonese, Punjabi, Hindi and Arabic. These are some of the major immigrant languages in the Waterloo-Wellington region of Ontario, where we will conduct our study. In this project we will: 1) interview and survey racialized immigrant older adults, their family caregivers, and health care providers, to better understand their current experiences in the health care system; and 2) work with these diverse groups to create resources and tools (such as information packets and online supports/technologies) that will support immigrant older adults and their health care providers. We will develop tools that are both informative, and support relationship building and communication between older adults and their health care providers."
Factors associated with childbirth self-efficacy among Canadian women,"['Stoll, Kathrin']",['N/A'],"['Attitudes About Childbirth', 'Childbirth Self-Efficacy', 'Confidence In Normal Birth', 'Health Promotion Research', 'Regression Modelling', 'Scale Construction', 'Scale Validation', 'Survey Research']",70000.0,206220,"Green & Baston (1) found that childbearing women in 2000 were significantly more likely to accept obstetric interventions than in 1987. Maternity care providers themselves would prefer elective Cesarean sections (CS) over vaginal deliveries if given the option (2-8). This increased reliance on technology has culminated in a medicalized culture of childbirth where normal spontaneous birth is rare. ""The whole ethos of the culture is that if the technology exists, we should use it,"" says Davis-Floyd (9) ""So, not using it looks like you are giving your baby substandard care.""

    Studies in Canada and worldwide that compare hospital birth with planned home birth consistently show that perinatal outcomes are not compromised in the low tech home setting (10-15). In fact, the best available evidence from the obstetric literature suggests that many interventions during labour and birth are associated with less than optimal perinatal outcomes (16-23). However, rates of elective obstetric procedures (like epidurals for pain relief, induction of labour and elective cesarean section) will continue to rise if  childbearing women continue to request them or are unable to offer resistance to health care providers' preference for elective interventions.

    The purpose of my dissertation research is to analyze data from 2,675 female university students who participated in an electronic survey about childbirth attitudes in 2007. I aim to understand which factors contribute to young women's confidence in childbirth and belief in their ability to cope with labour (a phenomenon called childbirth self-efficacy or CBSE). This is important because a lack of CBSE is associated with a preference for obstetric interventions, like epidural anesthesia and delivering a baby via Cesarean section (CS) (24). Planned CSs are associated with negative health effects for mothers and babies compared to planned vaginal deliveries (25), and are more costly to the health care system (26-27)."
The ethical considerations of age-related technologies in promoting health and well-being of older adults,"['Stone, Elise']",['N/A'],"['Ethics', 'Peer-Led Approaches', 'Technological Inclusion']",,497988,"Older adults are increasingly expected to use technologies that incorporate AI and machine learning to manage their health and well-being. Technologies such as smart assistive devices, mobile and smart home health monitoring, technologies that provide social interaction, and recommendation systems carry within their design age-biased individual, social, and technological assumptions about the older end-user. 

The limited uptake of technologies by older adults is widely recognized and discussed in existing aging and technology research, which calls for greater collaboration with older adults at all stages of innovation and development, but examples of older adult involvement is rare and often token. Cases of older adults designing and developing for their peers, producing technologies that they desire, that allows them to express their identity and agency is unexplored, and perhaps the ageist view that older adults are not capable of meaningfully contributing to health and well-being innovations should be considered a contributing factor.

Ageism, as a specific ethical concern of age-related technological innovation and use has not been extensively researched, but this gap in the literature provides an opportunity to consider how technology built upon ageist assumptions affects the health and welfare of older adults. How do older adults articulate or demonstrate their discomfort with technology that does not represent them? How do we change the narrative? Ageism is insidious in the way that it will reinforce internalized age biases, negatively effecting self-image, resourcefulness, and resiliency of the older tech user. Those that are excluded from use are often the most marginalized, the oldest old, poor, rural, female and/or racialized. Their ethical concerns are negated from the conversation because they have little or no exposure to age-related technologies, but it is imperative that they are included."
Implementing comprehensive school health: lessons learned from practice and key stakeholders,"['Storey, Kate E']","['Veugelers, Paul J']","['Chronic Disease Prevention', 'Implementation Research', 'Intervention Research', 'Knowledge Exchange', 'Nutrition', 'Physical Activity', 'School Health Promotion']",23995.0,246332,"Over the past few decades, alarming increases in childhood obesity have been documented around the world. This is concerning due to the consequences of obesity and the impact on chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and some cancers; all of which may result in a reduced quality of life. Preventing obesity is therefore essential to improve the health and wellbeing of children. Schools have been acknowledged as an important setting to address the issue of childhood obesity since children spend a significant proportion of their time in schools. Comprehensive (or Coordinated) School Health (CSH) is recognized by the World Health Organization as an effective strategy that aims to change the school and community environments in order to 'make the healthy choice the easy choice' where children live, learn and play. Although CSH approaches have the ability to be effective in changing children's eating and activity behaviours, less is known about how CSH is implemented and what makes CSH successful over time. The proposed work will build upon existing knowledge and experience by convening a meeting with school health experts to share current practices and identify gaps related to implementing CSH. This meeting (May 22, 2012) will be held in conjunction with the 2012 International Society for Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity Conference (May 23-26; Austin, Texas, U.S.A.) in order to allow for access to international experts of CSH, including those working with CATCH Texas. Information generated will be used as the basis for 1) a discussion paper; and 2) to inform a grant application examining the implementation and up-scaling of the Alberta Project Promoting active Living and healthy Eating in Schools, and other successful CSH interventions. This work will provide an opportunity to share knowledge, improve current practices, and will also help to facilitate international collaboration amongst researchers, policymakers and practitioners."
Sleeping soundly: Understanding the translation of sleep promotion at school to sleep behaviours at home. Insights from children and parents,"['Storey, Kate E']","['Flynn, Jenn', 'McKernan, Christine', 'Torrance, Brian', 'Brown, Cary A', 'Neely, Katherine(Kacey C', 'Sulz, Lauren', 'Veugelers, Paul J']","['Child Health', 'Comprehensive School Health', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Population Health Intervention Research', 'Qualitative Methods', 'School-Learned Health Behaviours', 'Sleep']",49590.0,368157,"Sleep is increasingly recognized as a behaviour that plays a vital role in achieving a healthy lifestyle, and is also crucial to children's development. Research has shown that inadequate sleep is associated with an array of physical and psychosocial health deficits including obesity, physical inactivity, poor nutrition, anxiety, depression, suicide risk, impaired concentration, ability to retain information, hyperactivity, impaired motor sills, and poorer overall health and immune function. Further, shorter sleep duration and poorer sleep quality are linked to poorer academic outcomes. The home and school are recognized as critical environments to shape healthy behaviours, and as such, health promotion efforts have increasingly focused on the school setting. While several school-based education initiatives have been implemented to support improved sleep among children, it is unknown if sleep behaviours are being translated home. The overall aim of this proposed research is to understand how school-based sleep education translates to sleep behaviours at home. Children are often viewed as change agents for health behaviours, thus this research will examine if and how children act as change agents and initiate sleep behaviour changes in the home. Parents also influence children's sleep behaviours, therefore this research will examine parents' perspectives regarding sleep and how parental support in the home environment reinforces school-based learning. Findings from children and parents will inform and strengthen existing school-based sleep education through an extensive stakeholder consultation."

As such, the City has developed a municipal vision to support growing 'up' (higher density), 'in' (infill development) and 'out' (new neighborhoods). As Edmonton grows, novel ways to promote active transportation and engagement with public spaces are needed. Active School Travel (AST), or walking and wheeling to/from school, is an innovative way to support healthy cities and aligns with Canada's Common Vision. AST improves mental and physical health and provides social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, current AST initiatives focus on getting from 'A' to 'B' (home/school). To create a healthy cities culture, active transportation, including AST, must prioritize the journey and the destination - engaging youth with public spaces. We propose a new model of AST: Active School Travel ABC's: Just getting from 'A' to 'B' misses what you could 'C'. This work will build on our existing knowledge, experience, and momentum for active transportation and public spaces in Edmonton and directly aligns with the City's Vision 2050. Edmonton has the necessary infrastructure to support AST. Our River Valley has over 160km of maintained multi-use pathways, all protected by Edmonton's Open Space policy. Cyclists are supported by Edmonton's Bike Plan with a growing system of bike lanes, shared roadways, and paths. Collectively, these assets support a connected, accessible city - one that is ripe for AST. Our strong team represents a diverse group of city leaders, researchers, developers, architects, health services, government, education, and the arts who have the capacity to implement our plan. We will: 1) co-develop an AST/public space strategy for Edmonton informed through youth engagement, 2) design implementation research projects to operationalize our plan, and 3) use our networks to ensure pan-Canadian impact and inform the scale-up of healthy cities initiatives."
'Build it so they will come.' Understanding lived experience to catalyze active transportation as a climate change intervention,"['Storey, Kate E']","['Lee, Karen K', 'Nykiforuk, Candace', 'Summers, Robert J']","['Active Transportation', 'Climate Change', 'Health Promotion', 'Healthy Cities', 'Implementation Science', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Physical Activity', 'Population Health Intervention', 'Public Health', 'Qualitative Methods']",125000.0,485336,"Edmonton has one of the highest per capita greenhouse gas emissions levels in the world (18 tonnes/person), with transportation accounting for 31% of these emissions. Additionally, Edmonton is one of the fastest-growing cities in Canada, with a population set to double in 30 years. Given this growth, interventions are necessary to mitigate climate change while densifying our city. Edmonton's Energy Transition Strategy states that building out the active transportation (AT) network is a key strategy to reduce emissions, and could support a 28% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. Ultimately, more individuals engaging in AT means less cars on the road, improves air quality, congestion, and safety. Thus, AT builds a safer, healthier, more connected and vibrant community for all. Notably, in December 2022, Edmonton City Council approved an investment of $100M over a 4-year period (2023-26) towards the Bike Plan. This investment is one of the most significant climate change and population health interventions in the City's history, and positions Edmonton as a leader in prioritizing safe, active, liveable and more sustainable cities. If implemented successfully (defined as meeting Edmontonians' needs), the Bike Plan will lead to modal shift in which more individuals are utilizing AT, thus less vehicles are on the road. This will reduce climate change health impacts, improve overall health and wellbeing and reduce chronic disease burden. However, our team recognizes we need to understand 'how do we build it to ensure they will come? We acknowledge a $100M investment is substantial, and with robust implementation is a catalyzing opportunity. Our research aims to directly fill this gap. Our goal is to provide the necessary qualitative research to support and inform the $100M Bike Plan investment to ensure successful implementation of this climate change intervention."

Still I Rise: Indigenous youth-led strategies as a pathway to wholistic health and health equity,"['Storey, Kate E']",['N/A'],"['Child And Youth Health', 'Health Equity', 'Implementation Science', 'Indigenous Health', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Population Health Intervention Research', 'Qualitative Research', 'School Health', 'Social Determinants Of Health']",375000.0,454085,"Indigenous youth are disproportionately affected by poor health. The root causes are broad and directly linked to the lasting effects of colonization. To improve wholistic health, we need to acknowledge these generational and structural challenges. Accordingly, population health interventions aimed at reducing disparities must recognize the historical and contemporary adversity Indigenous youth face, and be grounded in decolonizing approaches which prioritize Indigenous resurgence and self-determination. This program of research will determine how an exemplar, evidence-based culturally affirming population health intervention (the Indigenous Youth Mentorship Program, IYMP) serves as a pathway to wholistic health and health equity. IYMP is an after-school healthy living program delivered by Indigenous high school (youth) mentors for younger elementary students. The core components are: 1) healthy eating, 2) physical activity, and 3) relationship building and mentorship. While children are the intended beneficiaries, we now understand the tremendous impact IYMP has on youth mentors. Mentors have experienced positive benefits related to the social determinants of health including their education, employability, and social networks. We have started to document these benefits; however, efforts have been piecemeal. This research will build on IYMP's success, to determine how IYMP serves as a pathway to address two critical determinants of health: educational attainment and pathways to employment. This work will generate innovative methods and will rely on implementation science adapted for relevance within Indigenous communities prioritizing youth voice and ways of knowing. The proposed program of research will, in partnership with Indigenous youth examine if and how a school-based, communal culturally affirming intervention (i.e., IYMP) serves as a pathway to educational attainment and employability - ultimately improving wholistic health and health equity."

Finding ways to increase PA in the workplace can improve health, reduce sick days, and increase productivity. Traditionally prescribed, sustained aerobic exercise (""cardio"") is impractical for many office employees who are unfit and low on time. Such barriers can be overcome by adopting high-intensity interval training (HIIT) - short-duration exercise that involves multiple brief, high-intensity efforts, separated by periods of rest. Stair climbing HIIT can benefit physiological health in less time than traditional exercise training. Further, recent studies show promising psychological implications of engaging in HIIT. Given that stair climbing HIIT is time-efficient and can be easily incorporated into one's daily schedule, there is considerable potential for using it in the workplace.

Phase 1 of this research will involve office employees undergoing an 8-week HIIT program of either a) one short HIIT session completed during lunch break or b) brief exercise bouts performed throughout the workday as ""exercise snacks."" The exercise will consist of stair climbing, which is an effective, lifestyle-based form of HIIT. Phase 2 will deliver an 8-week optimized HIIT program designed to be sustainable. We will measure physical and psychological health, work productivity, sick days and PA behaviour during and up to 6-months following the program.

This research will be the first to determine the health, work productivity, and PA behaviour benefits of practical HIIT programs delivered in the workplace. This research has important implications for employees who may be at risk for chronic diseases, employers seeking greater output from employees, and for Canadian society - which benefits from healthier and more productive workplaces."

Poor sleep can negatively impact health. Poor sleep behaviours are associated with problems with daily functioning, poor mental health and quality of life, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Sleep problems are particularly problematic among middle-aged and older adults, since aging affects how sleep. Sleep problems do not occur randomly across the population-certain subgroups of people may experience more problems than others, including socioeconomically disadvantaged people (for example, people with low incomes), and ethnic minority groups. Sleep problems may also differ depending on where you live. People living in neighbourhoods with high levels of nighttime light, noise, and air pollution may have more problems with sleep, whereas people living in neighbourhoods with more greenspace (for example, living closer to a park) may have better sleep. This study will use national data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging and the Canadian Urban Health Research Consortium to examine socioeconomic and environmental determinants of inequities in sleep behaviours among middle-aged and older adults in Canada. This project will help to identify groups of people who do not sleep well in Canada, and who are at risk of poorer health outcomes as a result.

Identifying factors that lead to unprotected anal intercourse between MSM is important to the development of HIV prevention interventions that target this population. Erectile dysfunction may be a possible risk factor contributing unprotected anal intercourse incidence among MSM. Moreover, the prevalence of erectile dysfunction is higher among MSM than heterosexual men, and highest among HIV-positive MSM. Although heterosexual men experiencing erectile dysfunction are more likely to engage in unprotected vaginal intercourse than healthy heterosexual men, this phenomenon has not yet been explored among MSM. However, MSM who use erectile enhancing drugs are more likely to engage in unprotected anal intercourse, especially when used in combination with other illicit drugs. This project aims to explore the relationship between erectile dysfunction, unprotected anal intercourse, erectile enhancing and illicit drug use among HIV-negative and HIV-positive MSM. A community sample of HIV-positive and HIV-negative MSM, who have and have not experienced erectile dysfunction within the past six months, will be recruited. Participants will complete a series of questionnaires at baseline, 3-months, and 6-month follow-up. The findings from this project will not only add to the existing body of literature regarding risk factors of HIV transmission, but will also be important to the development of an effective HIV prevention intervention for MSM who are experiencing erectile dysfunction."

The ensuing media attention brought longstanding poor health, lack of services, and abject violence experienced by street sex workers to the public forefront. In the wake of this attention, street communities, families of victims, service providers and advocates are demanding action to ensure that all women are protected and provided for. Paramount to these measures of safety is access to health services, which often act as a crucial contact point between disenfranchised populations and a network of social services.

The proposed events will disseminate findings from past research with street sex workers and the family members of street sex workers across western Canada. The events will bring together street sex workers, frontline health service providers, policy makers and academics in collaborative workshops.

"Youth Vaping Assessment, Prevention and Early intervention (Y-VAPE): A combined policy and intervention approach to curb youth vaping.","['Struik, Laura L']","['Dow-Fleisner, Sarah']","['Health Promotion And Disease Prevention', 'Population Health', 'Youth Health']",19263.0,411954,"Vaping among school-aged youth is a major public health problem, with the last few years marking a concerning surge in youth vaping. Tobacco control advocates, provincial leaders, and federal leaders are therefore urgently calling for efforts to curb youth vaping. Schools are ideally suited to address the issue; however, a lack of school policies and upstream interventions has left schools empty-handed. This project will address this gap through the development of a community-driven, interdisciplinary research initiative called the Youth Vaping Assessment, Prevention and Early Intervention (Y-VAPE) project, a school-based vaping prevention program that will integrate policy and intervention research into the school environment. Through a collaborative, interdisciplinary and engaged stakeholder approach, this project will lend to an increased understanding of vaping among youth, and how to meaningfully respond to it through policy and intervention. The ultimate aim of this project is to inform the development of school policy and peer-led, youth-driven interventions. This will be accomplished through the following four activities: 1) an environmental scan of existing literature on youth vaping and interventions to date; 2) a policy scan of national, policy, and school-level policies related to vaping; 3) foster collaborative relationships with multiple stakeholders, including youth; and 4) develop a CIHR operating project grant. Outcomes of this project will include the establishment of a multi-stakeholder team, evidence syntheses, directions for next steps in project development, early knowledge translation outputs, and proposal development. Between the expertise of the research team and the underpinning collaborative, integrated knowledge translation approach, this project will position Canada as a leader in efforts to curb youth vaping."

Increasing evidence confirms that e-cigarette use is associated with nicotine addiction, subsequent smoking, and increased risk for heart and lung disease. Given that youth are disproportionately at risk for these negative impacts, the public health community has raised alarm around the high rates of use among youth. As a result, the Federal Government has called for efforts to address tobacco use that is inclusive of e-cigarettes such that we can reach the goal of under 5% use of all tobacco products by 2035. Achieving this goal in the context of exponential e-cigarette uptake requires the rapid development and innovation of tobacco control efforts, especially for young Canadians. In light of recent youth-informed evidence detailing the complex interplay between youth cultures, unique contexts, and various behavioral factors (e.g., social norms, environmental factors) that play a role in vaping uptake, prevention measures that reflect this complexity are urgently needed. The goal of this project, therefore, is to move this evidence into action so that e-cigarette prevention efforts resonate with them and are derived from, and embedded within, youth cultures and socio-environmental contexts. Through purposeful engagement with diverse youth, we will develop and test tailored prevention messaging for delivery on social media platforms that are popular among youth. This is a first of its kind study in that the foundation upon which this study is being launched, conducted, and evaluated is that of youth voices, which inherently carries significant potential to prevent uptake of e-cigarettes by youth. Given that tobacco-use behaviours have a lasting negative impact for many years after the behaviour has been initiated, even in the event of cessation, the success of this project carries equal potential in curbing this negative impact."
Complicating the Stress Process Model: Understanding Mental Health and the Mediating Role of Social Support Networks among Queer Youth,"['Stuart, Katherine E']",['N/A'],"['Adolescents', 'Canada', 'Cultural Context', 'Mental Health', 'Queer', 'Social Support', 'United States']",105000.0,206221,"Pearlin et al's (1989) Stress Process Model (SPM) examines the interplay between ""the sources of stress, the mediators of stress and the manifestations of stress,"" thus positioning mental health disorders as the result of a process rooted in social structure. While providing an intricate framework for understanding mental health disorders, I argue that the SPM fails to adequately emphasize the importance of cultural context on the relationship between mediators of stress, namely social support networks, and manifestations of stress.  Drawing upon Griswold's (2004) notion of the interconnection between the social world, cultural phenomenon and social actors I will explore the hypothesis that traditional sources of social support (family, peer groups and religious communities) are transformed from stress moderators to sources of distress among queer youth in North America.  I will utilize both quantitative (statistical analysis of the Add Health data set) and qualitative (interviews) methodologies in order to explore the following research questions: (1)How does the composition of a queer youth's social support network change following 'coming out'? (2)What is the impact of traditional social support networks on the mental health of queer youth after the coming out process? (3)How does the cultural climate (level of homophobia) of the social world shape a queer youth's experiences with traditional sources of support?"

There is no known cause of MS although it has both genetic and environmental factors, and an interaction is likely between these two factors. An international study will soon be launched in Norway, Serbia, Sweden, Italy and Canada, with the focus of examining the independent and joint role of smoking, vitamin D exposure (through diet and sunlight exposure), and Epstein-Barr virus infection  on the risk of MS.  The proposed research project is a pilot to the Canadian portion of the international study and will focus on the design of the study, including the conduct, analysis and interpretation of 50 MS cases and 75 controls. A standardized mailed questionnaire has been developed and will be piloted in Canada in the summer of 2010. The focus of the pilot will be to analyze all aspects of the study, including subject recruitment and response rates, and to determine potential improvements of the study before the Canadian portion launch date. The pilot study is an essential step to ensure the feasibility of conducting the larger Canadian portion of the international study.  The international study is a critical step forward in MS etiological research and will shed new light on the modifiable risk factors of MS."
Perception of marijuana access among youth in the COMPASS study,"['Stypulkowski, Amanda']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,383041,"COMPASS is a CIHR-funded longitudinal study investigating youth health behaviours across Canada. The purpose of this study was to examine how personal characteristics, behavioural characteristics, and individual opportunities and constraints influence youth perceptions of marijuana access. Cross-sectional student-level data collected from the COMPASS host study (Year 4: 2015-2016) was used for analysis. Student-level data was available for 40,436 grade 9 to 12 students attending secondary schools in Ontario and Alberta. Logistic regression modelling was used to examine student characteristics associated with the likelihood of perceiving marijuana access as easy. Results show that any previous use of marijuana increased the likelihood of perceiving marijuana access as easy relative to never users. Engagement in risk-taking behaviours such as binge drinking, smoking, and skipping class were associated with an increased likelihood of perceiving access to marijuana as easy. Additionally, reported ease of access increased with each successive grade level. Findings suggest that there are great opportunities to improve marijuana control among youth. This research can be used to compare how perceived access to marijuana changes among youth after legalization."

Social and structural factors contributing to HIV/STI transmission include stigma regarding sexual violence, HIV infection and sexual orientation. While HIV prevention and overall sexual health programs targeting youth in Peru have been implemented , key populations of youth (sex workers, male youth and transgender) continue to be overrepresented in new cases of HIV and STI in Peru.  In this CIHR Planning grant we aim to develop an interdisciplinary, international research team to understand HIV/STI prevention priorities among youth in two culturally and geographically diverse cities in Peru, Lima, the capital city, and Ayacucho, in the Andean region. Team members represent social science and clinical researchers from Canada,  Peru and USA. We plan: 1) to conduct a review of existing research, legislation, policies and practices on HIV/STI prevention in Peru; 2) to conduct in April 2014 knowledge users (youth) and stakeholders consultations (health care providers, community organizers) in both locations and, 3 ) to conduct  in June 2014 two community forums with community partners, stakeholders, health researchers and knowledge users from Ayacucho and Lima. The goal of the consultations and community forums would be to share HIV/STI and sexual health priorities across these two cities and to plan a viable, cultural, age and gender appropriate HIV prevention and health promotion research project with youth in these two diverse regions. The lessons learned of developing the planned international, interdisciplinary team will serve to the following knowledge translation (KT) goals:  a) to inform a CIHR Community-based HIV Research Catalyst Grant; and b) to inform peer reviewed and non-peer reviewed publications/ presentations regarding HIV/STI prevention research priorities among youth in Peru."

Diagnosing OA is challenging due to delayed referral by general practitioners, or specialists' failure to take proper diagnostic steps. The procedures are complex and time-consuming; it could be several months before a diagnosis is established. Often times, patients did not complete the process, especially those who live in distant places. Moreover, specific inhalation challenge (SIC) as the reference test is only available in a few specialized centres worldwide. These problems inspired researchers at the HÃ´pital du SacrÃ©-Coeur de MontrÃ©al to develop model consisted of information from clinical interview as well as objective tests other than SIC (i.e. non-SIC based model) for diagnosing OA. In a pilot project, they successfully developed the model in workers exposed to high-molecular-weight (HMW) agents (mostly proteins, e.g. flour, animal allergens, latex agents) in Quebec data and validated in European data. Four objectives are proposed in this project: to develop non-SIC-based diagnostic models for OA induced by low-molecular weight (LMW) agents (mostly chemical agents, e.g. isocyanates, red cedar) in Quebec data and validate them in Poland data (Objective#1); to evaluate the clinical value of both HMW- and LMW-induced OA models in places where SIC is routinely done (Objective #2) and in places where SIC is not available or routinely done (Objective #3); and finally for knowledge transfer, the OA models will be transformed into calculators (""OccAs-Calc"") and made available in Web and mobile versions (Objective#4). Our model has a potential to be implemented as one-visit diagnostic procedure for patients coming to a work-related asthma center. OccAs-calc will facilitate the implementation of the models in occupational health practice in Canada and worldwide."

People of indigenous origin are more likely to have diabetes than non-indigenous people. It is estimated 8 in 10 people of aboriginal descent will develop diabetes in their lifetime. Further, people from aboriginal communities have difficulties navigating the health care system. Some reasons for health inequalities are directly and indirectly related to several socio-economic determinants of health. As per the Diabetes Obesity Nutrition, Scientific Clinical Network, their 2014-2017 priority areas are to provide: better care for patients and families with diabetes, prevent and reduce the risk of comorbidities, and improve access to healthcare at a systemic level. Thus, the overall goal of this project is to make a positive health impact on the aboriginal communities by identifying and evaluating health risk and concerns faced by these communities and implementing strategies to reduce the negative impacts on health and enhance positive effects. To achieve these objectives we will conduct a review of literature to identify needs, barriers and facilitators to health care access of the aboriginal communities and existing programs and policies that address it. A qualitative study using interview/focus group discussions will be conducted at two reserve communities in greater Edmonton to understand the needs, barriers and facilitators to access healthcare of the aboriginal people with diabetes (Type 1 and 2), aged (30-75 y), their family and community support and health care professional. The information obtained from the qualitative study and the literature review will help in developing tools and strategies to educate about Diabetes Self-Management (DSM) and Shared Decision Making (SDM) in the aboriginal communities. The creation of tools and pathways for DSM/SDM through this project can facilitate future targeted programs in these communities for positive health impact/better health outcomes for indigenous persons"
Applying time-series bibliometric analyses as a novel Open Science approach to assess long-term scientific and clinical changes in chronic pain management and opioid use,"['Sud, Abhimanyu']","['Cheng, Darren K', 'Moineddin, Rahim', 'Upshur, Ross E', 'Zlahtic, Erin']","['Bibliometric Analysis', 'Chronic Pain', 'Open Science', 'Opioid Use', 'Systematic Review', 'Time Series Analysis']",25000.0,505156,"Opioid use remains a public health emergency across North America with growing rates of opioid-related harms including poor physical and mental health outcomes, wider social impacts such as reduced employment and increased criminal activity, and more deaths associated with overdose. New Open Science methods are needed to better understand how the research community can better address the ongoing crisis.

One example of such an Open Science method is to analyze whole fields of research and their relationships to clinical and population health outcomes. Our project aimed to perform a bibliometric analysis regarding multidisciplinary care for reducing opioid use for chronic pain by analyzing all the citations of nearly 100 studies included in a systematic review. 

Through an analysis of 3398 studies across a 44-year time span, we identified three distinct periods in the scientific literature which we compared with historical reports and real-world data on opioid use and related harms. In the first period (1975-1985), opioids were used mostly at low doses and were combined with psychological and behavioral strategies. In the second period (1986-2003/4), opioids were used more widely and in higher doses for pain management and often without psychological or behavioural strategies. In the third period (2004/5-2019), there were increasing concerns with opioid-related harms and the need to slowly and safely reduce opioid dosage. We were able to demonstrate that opioid-related mortality trends patterned very closely to trends we identified in this scientific field.

By applying bibliometric analyses, we learned new information about changing patterns of opioid use over time and showed that how we do research can impact peoples' health. We can use this information to recognize new areas of research in population health, develop and build upon health policies, and improve upon clinical care to successfully respond to the current opioid overdose crisis in North America."

However, there is a growing emergence of community-acquired C. difficile infections of unknown origin and they are affecting Canadians with increased severity. As spore-forming bacteria, C. difficile can persist in generally adverse conditions and one of its vectors may be food. C. difficile has been relatively frequently isolated from livestock, retail meats, and ready-to-eat salads, however there is not much known about capacity to survive and grow in foods to cause infection.  This study will address the minimum growth conditions of water activity, pH, and temperature that C. difficile is able to proliferate in. These conditions will model the environment of our foods so that we can determine whether a food can support the growth of C. difficile. Furthermore, we will test the genetics of C. difficile isolates from multiple sources including clinical, veterinary, and foods, to examine their possible routes of transmission. Finally we will conduct further surveys of foods for the presence of the bacteria and type the strains to gain better insight into their clinical relevance. There have not yet been any confirmed cases of foodborne illness by C. difficile. However, the chance of food being an infectious vector of it may incite a need to adapt our federal regulatory policies to prevent this contamination which can limit the spread of C. difficile infection within the community."

This project will directly support the development of health research capacity for observational drug safety and effectiveness studies in the province of NL. Specifically, this project will demonstrate the value of the administrative health care databases with the province of NL for conducting observational pharmacoepidemiologic studies by replicating 2 recent CNODES studies that evaluated the potential adverse effects of a class of cholesterol lowering drugs called statins. Briefly, this demonstration project will replicate the analytic protocols for a CNODES study that evaluated the association between statin use and the occurrence of acute kidney injury, and a CNODES study that evaluated the association between statin use and the occurrence of diabetes after a heart attack or stroke. 
Furthermore, this project will work towards developing compatible research processes with the CNODES organization within the province of NL, with the goal of making it the 8th province to contribute to CNODES projects.

an association between diabetes and cancer incidence has been put forward. However, studies conducted on thisassociation have produced contradictory results. In addition to this association, the role of insulin in the pathogenesis ofcancer in patients with diabetes has also become the focus of recent research. To date, only one epidemiological study wasconducted on this issue, but methodological limitations render its results inconclusive. Thus, in view of the increasingincidence and prevalence of diabetes worldwide, particularly of type 2, and the greater need for insulin in these patients,
more research is needed to evaluate the roles of the disease and of its insulin treatment on the incidence of cancer inpatients with diabetes. Therefore the first objective of the proposed project will be to compare the rates of cancer incidenceand mortality in a population-based cohort of patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes assembled from the Saskatchewancomputerized health insurance databases with those observed in the population. The second objective will be to determinewhether the use of insulin increases the risk of four common cancers (lung, colorectal, prostate and breast) in patients withtype 2 diabetes. The second objective will be answered using a nested case-control approach using the General PracticeResearch Database (GPRD).

Given the contradictory results published in the literature thus far and lack of Canadian data on the topic, the proposed studywill clearly establish the association between diabetes and cancer within the Canadian context. It will also determine whetherinsulin promotes the development of cancer in patients with Type 2 diabetes. As such, this study has the potential ofidentifying factors associated with cancer which may be used to develop new preventive strategies."

This will be achieved by conducting a cohort study using the General Practice Research Database, a large primary care database from the United Kingdom. This database contains medical information on over 100,000 female patients who used antipsychotic agents (both typical and atypical) between 1988 and 2006, followed until the end of 2009.

Because we live in an aging society with an increasing number of elderly drivers, it is of interest to assess the impact of the interactions between commonly used drugs on driving safety in the elderly.

This study will use the cohort of over 700,000 patients, all elderly drivers from the Province of QuÃ©bec between 1999-2008, identified from the computerized databases of the SociÃ©tÃ© de l'Assurance Automobile du QuÃ©bec (SAAQ).

Although, elderly people are heavy consumers of several commonly used drugs with known psychomotor impairment, no studies have assessed the impact of the use of multiple drugs by elderly drivers on the risk of motor vehicle crash.  As the proportion of the elderly driving is increasing, the rate of car crashes causes by medication use will increase and will represent a growing concern for public health because of the associated morbidity and mortality.  The results of the research will be useful for the development of appropriate policies regarding preventive driving measures, as well as clinical guidelines for the management of elderly patients."

Ensuring the safety of new drugs, to minimize drug-induced hospitalizations and deaths, is a critical function undertaken by Health Canada. To improve Canada's ability to monitor the safety of drugs the federal government in 2011 provided funding to create a large team of leading Canadian drug safety researchers and applied this expertise to large databases in seven provinces. The result was a state-of-the-art applied research infrastructure specifically designed for studying drug safety called the Canadian Network for Observational Drug Effect Studies (CNODES). , With access to Canadian and international data on over 100 million people, CNODES has performed important research that has answered crucial questions, such as: do potent statin drugs (to lower cholesterol) cause kidney damage and diabetes? Do acid pump inhibitors (for heartburn) trigger pneumonia? Do the newer, allegedly safer, anti-psychotic drugs cause diabetes? Is isotretinoin for severe acne increasing the number of newborn infants with abnormalities? Do new treatments for diabetes cause cancer of the pancreas and damage to the heart? 
Having established one of the world's largest drug safety networks, we are proposing continuation of funding for a further five years to continue monitoring the safety of new drugs being introduced onto the Canadian market. Having learned how to use the network we will improve engagement with a broader range of stakeholders as well as increase productivity, efficiency and timeliness of the work. CNODES will continue to develop new statistical methods in drug research and will also study 'real world' benefits to determine whether new drugs deliver on the promises made by their manufacturers. Our proposal also outlines plans for training the next generation of Canadian drug safety and effectiveness researchers, ensuring maximal benefit to Canadians from this investment of research funds."
Optimisation of precision therapy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: A dynamic treatment regime analysis,"['Suissa, Samy']","['Ernst, Pierre-Paul', 'Wallace, Michael P']","['Comparative Effectiveness', 'Data Analysis', 'Database Research', 'Inhaled Corticosteroids', 'Long-Acting Bronchodilators', 'Pharmacoepidemiology']",271576.0,489950,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is now the third leading cause of death worldwide. Single or dual long-acting bronchodilators are the primary initial therapy recommended for patients with COPD, with inhaled corticosteroids added with increasing severity. However, the evidence for these recommendations is unknown for newly diagnosed patients. The effectiveness of these treatment appears to vary with different patient characteristics, including blood test and clinical measures. We believe that these characteristics could help to identify the optimal treatment for a newly diagnosed COPD patient that balances the effectiveness with the risk, according to the patient's specific profile.
The ""dynamic treatment regime"" approach is an analytic strategy to identify patient-treatment profiles that optimize clinical outcomes over time. We will use this approach in a large cohort of over 200,000 patients newly diagnosed with COPD from a large primary care database that includes medical records for over 16 million people. This project will bring together expertise in pharmacoepidemiology, respiratory medicine, and biostatistics. It will also use a large and powerful healthcare database that includes extensive clinical and laboratory data, not available in other such data sources in Canada.
This large real-world setting study of the treatment of COPD along with the dynamic treatment regime approach will result in a precision medicine algorithm to optimize the management of newly diagnosed patients with COPD. By using patient characteristics routinely measured in the typical clinical setting, clinicians will be able to choose the optimal treatment path for each patient, according to their clinical profile, that increases the effectiveness and reduces the risk of treatment. The knowledge resulting from this study will be disseminated to a broad audience of clinicians, patients, and the public."

Rethinking somatization: unpacking cross-cultural differences in symptom presentation and atypical depression among Chinese and Canadian outpatients.,"['Sun, Jiahong']",['N/A'],"['Clinical Psychology', 'Culture Psychology', 'Depression', 'Depressive Symptomatology', 'Immigrant Mental Health', 'Somatization']",17500.0,254804,"Research suggests that depressed patients of Chinese heritage tend to emphasize somatic symptoms (e.g., fatigue) as opposed to psychological symptoms (e.g., worthlessness). Such tendency has been referred to as somatisation. Recent studies have also supported the idea that Chinese depressed patients are more likely to report somatic symptoms than their 'Western' counterparts. In 2010 fall, I analyzed an archival dataset and found that contrary to my expectation, Euro-Canadian depressed patients were more likely to report atypical somatic symptoms - weight gain, appetite gain, and hypersomnia - than Chinese depressed patients, and they were also more likely to received a diagnosis of atypical depression (AD). Therefore, the current project seeks to first replicate these findings and then move beyond a simple observation of cross-cultural differences by investigating factors that are influencing such differences. I predict that Chinese patients will report a higher overall level of somatic symptoms and higher level of typical somatic symptoms (e.g. insomnia), whereas Euro-Canadian patients will reported a higher level of atypical (e.g. insomnia) somatic symptoms and are more likely to receive a diagnosis of AD. I also predict that the relation between cultural group and AD will be influenced by greater endorsement of 'Western' cultural values and higher SES. This study has three main implications. First, a better understanding of symptom presentations can improve the diagnosis and treatment of depression for Chinese-Canadians, one of the fastest growing groups in Canada. Second, our findings may challenge the simplistic view that only Chinese heritage patients tend to somatize depression, whereas in fact Euro-Canadians patients are more likely to experience atypical somatic symptoms. Finally, our results encourage mental health practitioners to pay attention to specific patient characteristics instead of making generalized assumptions based on one's group membership."

Children's health, even more so than adult's, is affected by the environment in which they live. Researchers from many disciplines have dedicated their work to improving the health of children through looking at the links between health and the environment. Over the past few decades, Children's Environmental Health (CEH) research and Ecosystem Approaches to Health (Ecohealth) research have been evolving in parallel, using many of the same theoretical frameworks and methodologies and even studying the same issues in some cases. In New Brunswick, a broad network of government departments, non-government organizations, private sector agencies, communities and individuals have come together to work collaboratively on a strategy for action to reduce children's exposure to environmental contaminants. Meanwhile, several New Brunswick researchers involved in this initiative became involved in the Canadian Community of Practice in EcoHealth (CoPEH-Canada). Realizing that there is much overlap in the strategies and interests of these groups and that they have much to learn from each other, a three day meeting of exchange and collaboration is proposed. The goals of this meeting are to exchange information, decide upon research priorities for CEH in New Brunswick, formulate a string of interrelated research questions, and collaboratively begin writing a research proposal for submission to the CIHR in the fall of 2012. The outcomes of this meeting will be twofold: 1) lasting professional relationships among prominent CEH and EcoHealth researchers in New Brunswick and Canada, and 2) a well articulated set of research questions and a concrete research plan."
Gendered Expectations and Exemptions in Hospice Palliative Home Care for Clients with Cancer and their Family Caregivers,"['Sutherland, Nisha']",['N/A'],"['Cancer', 'Gender', 'Palliative Care']",1000.0,311428,"As end-of-life is complex and encompassing, few clients and caregivers in hospice palliative home care will see or challenge inequitable situations. Gender equity is particularly relevant in this context because home is a place in which gender relations are learned and care is largely hidden.  There is evidence to indicate that women make up the majority of family caregivers and tend to assume more care responsibilities than their male counterparts. This inequitable division of labour negatively affects the physical, financial and mental health of women, placing them at risk for early death. Furthermore, men may also face inequities as studies have indicated that health care providers may overlook emotional care for men. 
The purpose of this study was to uncover gender relations and the broader social factors that shape relationships and experiences in hospice palliative home care. Study findings are important to help develop strategies for policies and practices that promote gender equity in hospice palliative home care. Given the rising incidence and mortality rates of cancer in the aging population, now is the time to address gender equity in this context."
Promoting Just and Inclusive End-of-life Decision-making for Long-term Care Home Residents with Dementia and their Care Partners,"['Sutherland, Nisha']","['Brennan, Mariette', 'Dupuis, Sherry', 'Kontos, Pia C', 'St-Amant, Oona M', 'Wiersma, Elaine C']","['Access To Palliative Care', ""Alzheimer'S Disease"", 'Critical Analysis', 'End-Of-Life Decision-Making', 'Family Caregivers', 'Long-Term Care', 'Paid Caregivers', 'People With Dementia', 'Social Citizenship', 'Social Relations']",195075.0,389929,"By 2031, the number of people in Canada with Alzheimer's disease will nearly double. People with dementia experience progressive physical and mental decline and often require extensive care, with many spending the remainder of their lives in long-term care homes(LTCHs). Yet, many residents with dementia do not receive palliative care, an approach focused on comfort and quality of life. Because of stigmatizing attitudes and a system that focuses on mental functioning, residents with dementia and their care partners are often excluded from making decisions. As a result, many people with dementia have fewer opportunities for choice and may not die in the way they wish. The purpose of this study is to include residents with dementia and their care partners (paid
care workers and unpaid family members) when making decisions about dying. We will use methods of interview, observation and review of documents to understand how care decisions are made for residents with dementia. We will employ two theories. First, we use a relational model of citizenship  to understand the meaning of actions and intentions of people with dementia and include them in decision-making. Second, we use a critical feminist lens to highlight the influence of gender and other social relations in end-of-life decision-making. We will partner with LTCH care partners and people with dementia in the community to create a video that sheds light on fair practices and policies. This study is important to point to new ways of including residents with dementia and the people who care for them in making decisions towards palliative care. This study is essential for residents with dementia to have a fair chance to receive quality palliative care and die in the way they wish."
Borderline Personality Features and Dyadic Adjustment in a Non-Clinical Sample of Women,"['Sutherland, Shauna L']",['N/A'],"['Birth Control Pill', 'Borderline Personality Disorder Features', 'Dyadic Adjustment', 'Hormones', 'Interpersonal Relationships']",17500.0,201206,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is one of the least understood of the personality disorders. It is diagnosed three times more often in women than in men (Evardone, Alexander & Morey, 2007) and is characterized by relatively stable maladaptive traits including emotional and interpersonal instability (Linehan, 1993; Ebner-Priemer et al., 2008; South, Turkheimer & Oltmanns, 2008; Sturrock, Francis, & Carr, 2009; Tragesser & Robinson, 2009; Gardner & Qualter, 2009).  Recent research has demonstrated a link between hormonal changes associated with menstrual cycles and significant changes in the level and severity of borderline symptoms (Berlin, Raju, Schmidt, Adams & Rubinow, 2001; Evardone et al, 2007). Symptoms in women have also been found to worsen following oral contraceptive use and during phases of the menstrual cycle marked by increasing estrogen levels (De Soto, Geary, Hoard, Sheldon, & Cooper, 2003). Past research has focused on the existence of borderline traits, emotional instability, interpersonal attachment and oral contraceptive use in clinical samples of women yet no research to date has combined these constructs to determine the interplay between them in a community sample. The current literature suggests that mild (sub-threshold) forms of psychopathology are distressing and deleterious to psychosocial functioning and quality of life (Maser, Norman, Zisook, Everall, Stein, Schettler, & Judd, 2009).  Detecting these mild forms of psychopathology in a non-clinical sample and demonstrating their negative effects would help to emphasize the importance of preventative measures in current practice. Clinicians will also benefit from knowledge about possible explanations of this gender-link to Borderline Personality disorder and why women are so greatly affected.  It will also be of note to physicians that women who are diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder should be aware that oral contraceptive use may in fact intensify negative symptoms."

These figures will increase substantially as the Canadian population ages. Canadians with a disability deserve to lead meaningful lives and to participate actively in society.  Commercial spaces (e.g. shopping malls) are important public places in urban and rural centres across Canada, yet their social importance and potential for providing activities and opportunities for improving the social inclusion and participation of diverse populations is often neglected by researchers. The CafÃ©s (one French, one English) will help address this gap and encourage a meaningful dialogue about this issue between researchers and the general public and other multiple stakeholders (e.g. individuals with disabilities, disability advocacy groups, community organizations, rehab professionals, mall developers, architects, policymakers, shop keepers/owners & their patrons). Dialogue during the CafÃ©s will raise awareness within the community about the accessibility challenges (social & physical) faced by persons with disabilities as well as the shared benefits of designing public spaces that facilitate accessibility. The CafÃ©s will improve researchers' understanding of people in the mall (e.g. users/non-users, shopkeepers) and the interrelationships between them as they interact within the social context of the mall. They will provide essential groundwork for the future directions of CRIR's research, and that of others, examining how public spaces such as shopping malls can be transformed into enabling environments to maximize social transactions and meaningful participation in society."

Thus, our objective was to estimate the associations between changes in children's friendship networks and their PA, and to assess whether these associations are different for boys and girls over the transition to a higher school grade. Canadian children completed in-school health and SN surveys at multiple time points, which captured their PA participation and aspects of their SN (e.g., friendships), respectively. Sociodemographic-adjusted linear regression models were used to estimate the relationships between a child's PA and SN variables before, after and across the school-grade transition. Children's PA was related to the PA of their friends prior to and following the grade transition; however, we found no association between changes in children SN and their PA over transition to a higher grade, nor did we identify any differences in the associations according to gender. More research is needed to confirm whether children's school-based friendships are related to changes in their activity over time before school-based PA interventions are implemented."

My research objective will examine how patterns of daily physical activity are associated with cognitive performance in older adults. I plan to approach this from two different angles. Firstly, to determine whether cognitive performance is associated with the frequency and intensity of daily physical activity. Secondly, I will determine whether there is an association between cognitive performance and total daily sedentary behaviour and duration of sedentary bouts. My results will contribute to the growing body of work examining physical activity in dementia prevention. In particular, it will give insight into the daily physical activity patterns that may augment cognitive function in older adults. Optimistically, positive results could contribute to decreasing the risk of dementia through optimized physical activity choices."

The program trains innovative thinkers from diverse disciplines to work closely with each other and the public to understand and solve key population health issues.

Our MPH program consists of 45 credit units of study that consist of 8 required courses, a required 14-week practicum experience, and 15 credit units of elective course work.  The required coursework include classes in the five areas of public health and a culminating public health experience (our Capstone class).  The program was designed for completion in twenty months of full-time study.  While the program is designed to be a generalist MPH degree, through the selection of the elective coursework students can specialize their public health knowledge base in one of health promotion, health policy, environmental health, biostatistics, or applied epidemiology.

Our core faculty teaching within the program are experts in many fields intersecting with Public Health, including Biostatistics, Toxicology, Policy, Health Policy, Vaccinology, Molecular Virology, Veterinary Medicine, Statistics and Actuarial Science, Molecular Biology, and Molecular and Viral Immunology."

Applying attachment theory to perinatal mental health problems and their links with early postpartum parental functioning: A trans-diagnostic perspective using perinatal longitudinal cohorts.,"['Szekely, Eszter', 'Herba, Catherine M']","['Castellanos Ryan, Natalie', 'Laplante, David P', 'St-AndrÃ©, Martin']","['Adult Attachment', 'Anxiety', 'Depression', 'Mediation Analysis', 'Parent-Infant Bonding', 'Perinatal Mental Health']",74769.0,470942,"Pregnancy and the transition to parenthood can reactivate memories of one's own relationship with one's parents. Recent studies on postpartum depression and anxiety use attachment theory to better understand why certain people might be more at risk. For instance, adults with an insecure attachment style (i.e., either difficulty trusting others or being overly dependent in relationships) could be more at risk for experiencing anxious and depressive symptoms when their child is born. However, we do not know if parents with an insecure attachment style are also more at risk for experiencing anxious and depressive symptoms during pregnancy and if parents' own attachment style can help explain why many parents with perinatal anxiety and depression also have trouble bonding with their infants and feeling competent as a parent. 

We will use four large Canadian studies to answer these questions. A study of 460 patients who received mental health care during pregnancy and after giving birth (QPMD) and three studies of families in the community: MAVAN (N=590); 3D (N=2,366); RESPPA (N=1,794). We expect that an insecure adult attachment style leads to lower mother-infant bonding and parental competence, possibly through increasing anxious and depressive symptoms during pregnancy and after giving birth. 

Findings can help professionals find better ways to predict who might be most at risk, by not only asking questions about parents' mental health but also their own attachment experiences. Questionnaires on adult attachment can be given at any time during pregnancy or even before, and results tend to be fairly stable. This kind of information could also contribute to a better understanding of how risk can be passed on from one generation to the next, and to design interventions that empower expectant and new parents struggling with anxiety and depression in their parenting skills, thereby supporting their children's mental resilience from the earliest moments of life."

Clinician-researchers of the Thrombosis Program in collaboration with the Segal Cancer Center will organize and host a Cafe Scientifique titled ""Lots about Clots and Cancer: What Cancer Patients and their Families Should Know About Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism"", whose objectives are to educate cancer patients and their families on symptoms of VTE, situations that increase the risk of VTE, and ways to prevent VTE. Our Cafe will inform cancer patients and their families about VTE, a frequent and potentially life-threatening complication of cancer."
Statin use and the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism in the elderly: The STAVENO study,"['Tagalakis, Vicky']","['Azoulay, Laurent', 'Kahn, Susan R']","['Nested Case-Control Design', 'Outcomes', 'Pharmacoepidemiology', 'Recurrence', 'Statins', 'Venous Thrombosis']",63635.0,267571,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which is a term used to describe blood clots in the legs and lungs, is the third most
common cardiovascular disorder after stroke and heart attack, and predominately affects older men and women. It is
estimated that 1 in 100 Canadians over 70 years of age will be diagnosed with a VTE and that 3-20% will develop a second
VTE episode (or recurrence) within 12 months of completing treatment with anticoagulants (i.e. blood thinners). As a result,
clinical practice guidelines recommend that indefinite anticoagulation be considered in certain patients with first-time VTE in
order to prevent long-term recurrence and associated complications such as chronic venous insufficiency of the leg, and
even death from a fatal blood clot in the lungs. However, because anticoagulants are associated with an elevated risk of
major bleeding in the elderly, indefinite anticoagulation is not always an option for older patients with VTE. Recent evidence
suggests that statin medications which are commonly prescribed for the treatment of elevated levels of cholesterol may
protect against the development of a first-time VTE. We hypothesize that statins may also protect against recurrence of VTE.
As a result, we propose to investigate whether statin medications in older patients diagnosed with first-time VTE can reduce
their risk of another VTE by means of a population-based study that will use anonymously linked data from the QuÃ©bec
administrative healthcare database. This will allow us to follow a large number of patients with VTE over a 10-year period to
determine the effect of statin use on risk of recurrence. The results of our study will improve our understanding of recurrent
VTE in the elderly, and if a protective effect is seen then our evidence justifies carrying out clinical trials of statins for the
prevention of recurrent VTE in older patients."
Characteristics of anemia and iron status and their associations with blood manganese and lead among children aged from 3 to 19 years old from four First Nation communities in Quebec,"['Tahir, Emad']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],2800.0,368368,"Background: Canada is among countries with the lowest prevalence of anemia (3%). However, this prevalence is invariably higher among its First Nations (FN), particularly children.Â Childhood anemia is associated with growth, developmental, cognitive, psychomotor and immune system impairments. In indigenous communities,Â iron and other micronutrients deficiencies, infections and lead exposure are frequent, and possibly the main causes of anemia. Iron is a metal that interact with manganese (Mn) and lead (Pb). They share common absorptive pathways. Iron deficiency (ID) is known to increase the intestinal absorption of the Mn and Pb, thereby increasing their concentrations in the blood and eventually their neurotoxicity. Data from the transversal pilot study, First Nation Youth Health and Environment Pilot Study (YEH!) - conducted in 2015 among children aged 3 to 19 years old (n = 198) fromÂ four communities in Quebec, Canada - were used to: i) Characterize anemia (types and severity), iron status and their specific risk factors; ii) Study the associations between blood Mn, Pb and iron biomarkers.
Methods: Hemoglobin, iron biomarkers, blood Mn and Pb results and risk factors were assessed using blood analysis and interview-administered questionnaires. Descriptive and multiple regression analysis adjusting for relevant co-variables will be used to evaluate research objectives. 
Results: A high prevalence of ID, anemia and iron deficiency anemia (15,0%, 18,1% and 8,3% respectively) was found. Moreover, preliminary results show that 11,9% presented elevated blood Mn (median = 15,9 Âµg/L, range 7,1 - 31,9 Âµg/L), that negatively correlated to ferritin status ( -0,42; p < 0,0001). Conversely, blood levels of Pb were relatively low (median = 5,8 Âµg/L, range 1,8 - 50,4 Âµg/L).
Conclusions: This study will provide a better description of risk factors associated with youth anemia and ID, and interactions between ID, Pb and Mn, in order to foster healthier food environments of FN."
A Population-Based Examination of the Public Health Impacts of the Legalization of Recreational Use of Cannabis on Children and Youth from Manitoba,"['Taillieu, Tamara L']","['Afifi, Tracie O', 'Brownell, Marni D', 'Enns, Jennifer E', 'Katz, Laurence Y', 'Nickel, Nathan C', 'Sareen, Jitender']","['Cannabis Legalization', 'Cannabis Poisonings', 'Cannabis-Related Emergency Department Visits', 'Cannabis-Related Hospitalizations', 'Children And Youth', 'Criminal Justice System Involvement Among Youth', 'Impaired Driving Among Youth', 'Incident Rate Ratios', 'Pre- And Post- Cannabis Legalization Comparisons', 'Substance Use']",75000.0,491321,"The Cannabis Act legalized the use of marijuana by adults in Canada on October 17, 2018. Dried leaf products and oils were available for sale in the first year after legalization. Edibles, concentrates, and marijuana vaping products were not allowed to be legally sold in Canada for another year. These products were approved for legal sale in Manitoba in the second year, becoming available for purchase in early 2020. A main goal of The Cannabis Act was to protect the safety and health of children and youth by managing the production, sale, and use of marijuana. However, current evidence suggests that the legal availability of marijuana to adults might lead to more hospital, emergency, and intensive care visits of children and youth due to marijuana poisoning. The highest numbers of marijuana-related visits are among young children and in areas where edible marijuana products are available for sale.  Rules about the sale of marijuana differ across provinces and territories, so findings from other areas may not apply to Manitoba. Also, little is known about the effects of marijuana legalization on other aspects of public service use such as interactions with the justice system among youth in Canada. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of The Cannabis Act on the use of public health and justice services for children and teenagers. We will harness the extensive whole-population research data at the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy to compare hospital and emergency department visits among children and teenagers before and after The Cannabis Act was in effect, and to compare criminal charges related to marijuana and impaired driving among youth before and after The Cannabis Act was in effect. Study findings can help develop public educational materials about the potential harms of marijuana use and inform prevention and intervention programs that decrease the use of marijuana."

Depression and anxiety are common health conditions in pregnancy. Untreated depression or anxiety during pregnancy can negatively impact both the mother and child. Therefore, treatment in pregnancy with antidepressants is often needed to prevent adverse outcomes. However, antidepressant use has been linked with cardiometabolic side effects (e.g., changes in blood sugar, blood pressure, lipid levels, and weight) in adults (e.g., pregnant women) and children taking antidepressants. These cardiometabolic effects can cause lasting health issues and burden patients, families, and the healthcare system. Despite this, information on antidepressant use in pregnancy and the risk of later childhood cardiometabolic diseases in offspring is limited. Therefore, this study aims to identify the risk of cardiometabolic diseases (e.g., diabetes, high blood pressure) among children born to mothers who used antidepressants during pregnancy.  

Using Danish health registry data, I will compare the risk of cardiometabolic diseases among children exposed versus unexposed to antidepressants during their mother's pregnancy. With advanced statistical methods, I will examine the risk of childhood cardiometabolic diseases associated with antidepressant use during pregnancy, considering other factors that may influence this relationship (i.e., mother's depression status; timing, dose, or type of antidepressant; and child sex). I will then identify possible pathways between antidepressant use in pregnancy and cardiometabolic diseases among exposed children. 

This study will improve our understanding of the link between antidepressant use in pregnancy and the risk of childhood cardiometabolic diseases to help clinicians, public health leaders, policymakers, and patients make informed decisions about antidepressant medication use in pregnancy."

Methods: Information from a national health survey in the U.S. was combined with a user-friendly risk calculator developed and proven to be effective in Canada to estimate how big a problem diabetes will be in the U.S. over the next 10 years. Mock scenarios were simulated to see what effect different prevention strategies would have on reducing the impact of diabetes by targeting different groups of the population.

Results: It was found that the U.S. can expect upwards of 25 million new cases of diabetes over the next decade, but there are feasible strategies that can be put in place that could reduce this by almost 1/3 if they are targeted appropriately.

Conclusions: This is the first study to use such a robust diabetes risk calculator in the U.S. population, following its success and accuracy in Canada. It provides novel insight into what types of strategies produce the most benefit with respect to reducing diabetes, and is informative for health policy makers in the U.S. for determining where resources should be best prioritized."

In collaboration with Health Canada we will: (i) identify new environmental contaminants of Public Health concern; (ii) test them in two animal developmental models simulating exposure of human population; (iii) apply the obtained data to epidemiological survey; and (iv) inform the scientific community and regulatory organisations. Integrative platform will be developed in process of studying of three brominated flame retardants (BFRs) as examples: pentabrominated diphenyl ethers; decabrominated diphenyl ethers, and tetrabromobysphenol A. BFRs are used as fire-resistant additives in polymers. The breast milk of Canadian women contains the second-highest brominated diphenyl ethers levels, according to a new survey by Health Canada. Concentrations of TBBPA - the most widely used brominated flame retardant in the world - are rapidly increasing in human samples. As a result we anticipate obtaining platform (expert team, developed integrative protocols and methods, databases, bank of human samples, and equipment) suitable for rapid testing of developmental reproductive effects of emerging environmental substances.

Exposure to environmental chemicals and psychomotor development: prospective birth study of neurotoxic effects using peripheral biomarkers (GESTE study),"['Takser, Larissa']",['N/A'],"['Biomarkers', 'Child Development', 'Environmental Exposures', 'Epidemiology', 'Reproduction', 'Toxicology']",300000.0,170402,"Neurodevelopmental disabilities affect 3-8% of babies born each year in North America, with known etiology for less than 25% of those disabilities. The potential for environmental contaminants to produce neurological, cognitive, or other behaviour deficits as a result of developmental exposure has received increasing attention. Most environmental chemicals exert their toxic effects in the foetus via circulating blood through the placenta. The foetus is more susceptible to toxic exposure than the adult due to its fragile and rapid developmental state and lack of adequate defence mechanisms. Based on existing knowledge of the toxicity of persistent environmental pollutants from experimental research, we hypothesize that environmental exposure to Mn, Cd, Pb, PCB, PBDE and Hg simultaneously during prenatal life associates with increased risk of poorer psychomotor performances in children from the general population. In order to ensure the safety of current levels of environmental exposures during prenatal life in pregnant women from the general population, we propose to conduct a birth prospective cohort using biomarkers of effect for a mixture of known persistent substances."

Despite these critical developments, some important challenges remain when the outcome of interest is the time until the occurrence of an event, for example the time until death or the time until the recurrence of a cancer. The goal of this project is to develop new data analysis methods for estimating optimal treatment strategies that take into account patients' characteristics to study time-to-event outcomes. While these methods can be applied in various contexts, we consider as a motivating example the development of better recommendations on whether or not and which hormonal therapy to use for breast cancer patients."
"Network Dynamics, Sexual Behaviour, and HIV Among University Students in Africa South of the Sahara","['Taleski, Sarah J']",['N/A'],"['Epidemiology', 'Hiv Prevalence', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Sexual Behaviour', 'Sexual Network', 'Social Network', 'Sub-Saharan Africa', 'University Population']",66000.0,178094,"This project aims to investigate the dynamics, in terms of disease transmission and sexual behaviour, of HIV on university communities in Africa South of the Sahara by evaluating social and sexual networks. The effect of HIV on university students in low-income countries and the impact that this might have on community function has been under-investigated. As universities are responsible for building the capacity of trained professionals, the effect of HIV on university communities has implications for the university, country and region. A lack of systematic risk assessments, including estimation of HIV prevalence, within tertiary educational institutions remains a consistent problem throughout the African region. Employing a network analysis methodology will shift the focus from individual level risk factors and outcomes to a framework which integrates individual, partnership and overall network structures. Such analysis will allow a unique and effective way to look at concordant partnerships and mixing between different risk groups- both of which have been shown to increase HIV transmission within a population.  By taking biological samples from participants, an estimate of HIV prevalence within different networks will be established.  Through investigation of the genetic make-up of the HIV virus it is possible to look at transmission within the network.  Layering the social, sexual and viral transmission networks on top of one another it is possible to evaluate differences between the networks.  This study will assist policy makers in both allocation of resources and planning. Understanding the prevalence among university students will indicate where skilled human resources shortages within the country may occur.  Information about network structure and transmission will assist in developing, improving and targeting prevention strategies."

The goal of our proposal is to use the pan Canadian data from the Canadian Partnership for Tomorrow (CPTP) linked with provincial cancer registries and discharge abstracts databases to derive and validate models that identify women in the population who are at high risk for endometrial malignancies. Our modeling approach will enable the stratification of women into risk groups for which targeted prevention and screening strategies can be recommended.

Identifying those at high risk for endometrial cancer in the general population allows us to direct them to risk-reducing and screening programs for early detection. We want to better understand what factors lead to endometrial cancer. We previously proposed to validate models that predict cancer risk using participants characteristics using data from the large Canadian partnership for tomorrow health study, CanPATH, which recruited and followed thousands of healthy Canadians for many years. At the time of recruitment, CanPATH participants filled out questionnaires that collected health information about their lifestyle habits. We have linked this information with provincial cancer registries and administrative databases in three provinces, to monitor which participants eventually received an endometrial cancer diagnosis or had any underlying conditions that may ultimately lead to one. In this study, we propose to improve risk modelling by including additional data, such as environmental exposure data, from the CANUE database, as well as genetic data, previously measured on a subset of CanPATH participants. In addition, the data we have obtained from linking to medical databases enables us to see what happened to participants over time. This gives us the opportunity to update their risk calculations to take into account any changes that influence risk. This research will give us an encompassing view of what factors most influence risk so that they can be used in risk prediction models that guide which participants can benefit from risk-reducing and early detection programs."

Aboriginal communities in remote locations are vulnerable populations with limited resources and greater health disparities, making them especially susceptible to the impacts of climate change because their subsistence lifestyle is strongly tied to the environment. In a First Nation community located in the western James Bay region, many community members have noticed changes in the timing of seasons, snow type, ice freeze-up/break-up, and weather patterns. These changes have affected animal behaviour, hunting activities and the winter road, which have led to financial strain and well-being issues (e.g. food insecurity). Despite such changes, many First Nation community members have exhibited the ability to adapt. The ability to adapt to climate change is vital. However, as the effects of climate change are continually increasing the difficulty in everyday living, it is unknown whether Aboriginal communities will be able to withstand related stressors in the future. Thus, through a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach, this research project aims to 1) identify significant determinants of vulnerability to climate change among a First Nation community, 2) develop culturally-appropriate adaptation strategies that would reduce health risks to the effects of climate change, and 3) promote community well-being. A specific area of focus includes examining the health implications from the impacts of climate change on community infrastructure (e.g. housing, winter roads, and water sources), and subsequently, identifying and implementing sustainable interventions strategies. This research would be conducted in partnership with the Fort Albany First Nation community, located in the subarctic region of Canada."

While there are considerable benefits from modern drug therapy, the frequent occurrence of adverse drug-related events and the uncertainty about effects of drugs after they enter the market have highlighted fundamental shortcomings in the ability to actively monitor drugs after their approval. 
Electronic health records, computerized prescribing and automated patient follow-up systems are health information technologies that are being increasingly used to improve the quality of care around the world. These new health information technologies provide an unprecedented opportunity to develop an active surveillance system that will monitor and provide patients and physicians with real-time feedback on the comparative safety and effectiveness of new drugs. 
Conducting active surveillance on a collaborative international scale will provide more rapid information about drug safety and effectiveness from users around the world as well as permit more personalized risk/benefit analysis for subgroups where drugs may have a different risk/benefit profile.

While technological advancements have benefitted some people needing fertility treatments to become pregnant, there are legal, social, and clinical barriers to accessing that care, especially for diverse sexual and gender minority populations. Stigma-including homophobia and transphobia-is rampant throughout medicine as providers are not adequately trained to care for LGBTQ2SIA+ populations. For example, obstetricians often inadvertently make assumptions about a patient's gender, sex, sexual orientation, anatomy, gametes, and family configuration. Additionally, LGBTQ2SIA+ populations with multiple marginalized identities-particularly those that are Black, Indigenous, and People of Colour-experience even more barriers to access due to interlocking systems of oppression. This postdoctoral project, based in Harvard Medical School's Department of Population Medicine aims to address these issues by elucidating sexual orientation- and race-related differences in ART utilization. I will use both qualitative and quantitative methods to address three specific aims. First, I will quantitatively elucidate ART use by sexual orientation and race using large, prospective, and intergenerational cohorts housed at Harvard Medical School, namely, the Nurses' Health Study and Growing up Today Study. Second, I will conduct focus groups and interviews with ART providers to identify gaps and opportunities to improve service provision. Third, I will develop a conceptual model of queer reproductive justice with various recommendations for improving clinical practice and policymaking. Findings will be disseminated through peer review publications and reports for key stakeholders. These contributions will lay the groundwork for transforming ART use among vulnerable populations."

This is true in Canada, where gbMSM have a 131-times higher risk of HIV than other men, and in emerging economies like China, where Shanghai faces an explosive new epidemic that is two-thirds gbMSM.  PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis, the daily use of anti-HIV drugs by those at high risk) holds great promise for addressing this challenge, there has been little preparedness for its eventual rollout in Shanghai. While PrEP use is rising in Canada, ethnoracial minorities such as Chinese gbMSM are greatly underrepresented in existing clinical cohorts and research studies.  More work is needed in both settings to understand the suitability, knowledge and acceptability of PrEP among gbMSM to guide both community-based education and advocacy efforts, as well as policy.

We will conduct two parallel but distinct cross-sectional surveys to characterize community attitudes and readiness for PrEP among two cohorts of Chinese gbMSM, in Shanghai (n=400) and Toronto (n=100) respectively.  We will quantify PrEP suitability, knowledge and acceptability within community-based samples in each city, assess community perspectives on barriers and facilitators of PrEP use in each context, and compare findings between the cities to identify culturally- and contextually-specific lessons learned.  We will further compare the profile of participants reached through four different recruitment strategies, to inform plans for future work, and conduct stakeholder engagement to discuss implications and next steps.

Our approach is informed by our prior work on advancing PrEP policy in Canada, including the identification of objective risk-based criteria for PrEP among gbMSM, and use of a hypothetical 'PrEP cascade' for assessing which gaps in preparing communities for PrEP require greatest attention."

The rate of new HIV infections has declined dramatically thanks to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and antiretroviral treatment (ART) for people living with HIV, which suppresses the virus to undetectable, and thus untransmittable, levels.  However, important gaps remain: each year, roughly 2000 people become infected with HIV in Canada, including 500 in Ontario. It is estimated that about 50 are diagnosed late, 15% of people diagnosed do not achieve viral suppression, despite advances in service delivery and implementation strategies. While new delivery options are available, such as injectable ART, these have not been spread widely, although many patients are interested in them. Groups disproportionately impacted by HIV and negative HIV related outcomes include members of marginalized groups including sex and gender minorities, as well as racialized, newcomer and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups.  Reaching those 'left behind' in the HIV prevention and care cascade will require new transdisciplinary approaches that more precisely identify the specific predictors of poor outcomes such as HIV acquisition, and the specific contexts underlying HIV transmission. Grounded in a health equity framework, our objectives are:

1.To identify the underlying life-course trajectories, patterns of healthcare utilization and gaps in utilization that predict HIV cascade outcomes (PrEP use, PrEP persistence, HIV seroconversion, ART initiation, ART persistence) using epidemiologic and statistical models across linked data sets
2.To identify and characterize the social, health system, and economic contexts in which new HIV transmission events continue to occur in Ontario, using qualitative, social network analyses and phylogenetic methods
3.To co-create novel interventions for better reaching those left behind from existing PrEP and ART programs through an iterative, community-engaged approach."

The Act had two goals: to eliminate the illegal cannabis market and to reduce the use of cannabis by young Canadians. There are benefits to legalization such as eliminating harms from the criminalization of cannabis possession and increasing government revenue. However, cannabis use has been linked to health harms including addiction, mental health problems like psychosis, and poisonings. Policy makers wanting to minimize cannabis harms can draw on decades of research looking at the best way to regulate the sale of legal substances such as alcohol and tobacco. This research has found that when more stores sell alcohol and tobacco, people tend to use more of these substances, resulting in more health harms. Determining whether a similar relationship exists for cannabis has important implications for the goal of reducing use of cannabis by youth. To investigate this relationship, our research team will collect the location and hours of operation of all stores selling cannabis in Canada over a four-year period. We will track the evolving cannabis retail environment for important measures such as density of stores and concentration in low-income areas. In Ontario, cannabis retail stores were chosen by a random lottery, allowing us to compare people who live close to a store that was chosen vs. those that live close to a lottery applicant that was not chosen. We will then use databases containing records of all emergency department visits and hospitalizations in Ontario to see whether individuals who live near a store selling cannabis are more likely to have a health care visit caused by cannabis compared to those who do not. We will work with health and government officials at the local, provincial, and national level to communicate the results of our research and help design stronger policy related to regulating how and where we sell cannabis."

However, half of pregnancies are unplanned and improving health at the first prenatal visit is too late to prevent poor outcomes. Women with disabilities (WWD) represent about 10% of women of reproductive age and are becoming pregnant at similar rates to women without disabilities; yet, there is little research on the PCH of WWD in Canada. Attending to the PCH of WWD is important, as WWD experience physical and psychological health disparities that put them at increased risk for poor PCH. Further, compared to women without disability, WWD have lower rates of contraception use and experience higher rates of unplanned pregnancy, short spacing between pregnancies, and sexual violence. 

Using qualitative methods, this study aims to (1) understand the PCH of WWD in Ontario, (2) explore how social, health, and health care factors may impact the PCH of WWD, and (3) identify how knowledge of barriers to care and risks for poor PCH outcomes can be used to improve care for WWD. Women from three disability subgroups (physical, sensory, intellectual and developmental) and health care providers will be interviewed. Analysis will explore similarities and differences across disability subgroups, as well as compare WWD and health care providers' responses, to identify key PCH health needs of WWD, what might be contributing to PCH disparities among WWD, and which interventions may be most effective.

This study will be one of the first to explore similarities and differences across disability groups from the perspective of both WWD and care providers. This study will have important implications for reducing health disparities among WWD; it will inform the development of interventions to improve the PCH of WWD, which may in turn contribute to better outcomes for WWD and their infants."

Although about 10% women of reproductive age has a disability, we know little about their preconception health. 

In the presentation, I will describe the preconception health characteristics of women with physical, sensory, and intellectual and developmental disabilities in Ontario.

We conducted a population-based, cross-sectional study using Ontario health administrative data (2015-2016). We identified 15-44-year-old women with physical (n=254,844), sensory (n=87,639), intellectual and developmental (n=7,900), and multiple disabilities (n=27,920) and women without disabilities (n=2,303,066). Preconception health variables were social (poverty), health (chronic disease, teratogenic medication use, mental illness, history of assault), and health care factors (continuity of care). We described these characteristics using frequencies and percentages and compared women in each disability group to those without disabilities using standardized differences, wherein differences >0.10 were clinically meaningful.

We found that, compared to women without disabilities, women with intellectual and developmental disabilities were more likely to live in poverty. All four disability groups were more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, and asthma and to be using teratogenic medications. They were also more likely to have a mood or anxiety disorder, and women with physical, intellectual and developmental, and multiple disabilities were more likely to have a substance use disorder and to have experienced assault. However, all four groups were more likely to routinely access the same primary care provider, indicating high continuity of care.

My presentation will conclude with a discussion of future research directions and what obstetricians and gynecologists might do to help improve the preconception health of women with disabilities."

Although we recognize that the root causes of income-related problems of food insecurity do not lie at the community level, communities continue to be charged with the task of developing initiatives to help people meet basic needs.  We plan to work with collaborators and advisory groups in Halifax, Quebec City, Toronto, Edmonton and Victoria to chart the full scope of charitable food provisioning activities currently and assess each community's capacity to recognize and respond to problems of unmet food need.  Through this collaborative process, we hope to develop mechanisms to improve the 'nutrition safety net' in the participating cities.  Our research will also help to define the infrastructure and program and policy supports necessary to construct a more effective system of 'front-line' response to severe food insecurity."
Nutrition-Related Food Marketing in Canada,"['Tarasuk, Valerie S']","['Mendelson, Rena']","['Health Policy', 'Nutritient-Related Marketing', 'Nutrition Labeling', 'Obesity']",147992.0,189594,"Nutrition has become a popular marketing tool for food.  Our grocery stores are filled with food products that have health logos (e.g. the HealthCheck, PepsiCo Smart Spot, President's Choice Blue Menu, Kraft's Sensible Solutions) and nutrient content claims (e.g. 'a good source of calcium', 'reduced sodium', 'trans fat free') on their package labels.  These labels highlight positive characteristics, but the foods they promote are not necessarily healthy choices. At at time when almost two-thirds of adults and about one-third of children and adolescents in Canada are overweight or obese it is important to understand how nutrition messaging in the marketplace can influence food selection. We propose to examine the food choices being promoted through nutrition-related food marketing in Canadian supermarkets. We will survey supermarket shelves to see what kinds of foods are being promoted, and then assess the nutritional quality of a random sample of these foods.  Our work will help inform future policies on food labeling to promote food selection practices conducive to healthy body weights."

The limitations of these initiatives are widely recognized, but we lack the knowledge base to implement more effective responses.  This program of research is designed to identify viable and effective policy interventions to reduce household food insecurity in Canada. Through analyses of available Canadian and US survey data, we will identify the conditions that give rise to problems of household food insecurity in our country, determine the impact of various policies and programs on this problem, and estimate the health care costs associated with household food insecurity currently.

The nutrition implications of discretionarily fortified beverages,"['Tarasuk, Valerie S']",['N/A'],"['Beverages', 'Discretionary Fortification', 'Micronutrients', 'Public Health Nutrition']",99533.0,363350,"Concerns about sugar in Canada have led to a number of proposed interventions to discourage the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages. In some provinces, there are restrictions on vending machines in schools. There are also new federal restrictions on food and beverage marketing to children, as well as changes to the Nutrition Facts Table and a standardized front-of-package label which more clearly highlight the sugar content of products. Yet, since regulations were introduced in 2004 that permitted the addition of high levels of vitamins and minerals to approved products at the discretion of manufacturers (i.e., 'discretionary' fortification), we have seen the rise of a new group of beverages, including energy drinks, sports drinks, 'vitamin waters' and novel juices. These beverages contain high levels of nutrients, but there has been no assessment of how their consumption affects the nutritional health of Canadians. This research will analyze data from the nutrition-focused Canadians Community Health Survey conducted in 2015 to examine Canadians' consumption of discretionarily fortified beverages and assess the implications for nutrition. This understanding is important for future fortification policies, but also for the development of dietary guidance and labelling initiatives to better support Canadians to make healthy food and beverage choices."

In 2012, over 4 million Canadians lived in food insecure households - an increase of more than 600,000 people since national monitoring began in 2007. Families with children are at particularly high risk, with an estimated one in six Canadian children under 18 now living in food-insecure households. A study conducted in 2004 revealed that people affected by food insecurity had poorer quality diets and were at increased risk of not meeting their nutrient needs, when compared to other Canadians.  Since 2004, food prices have risen dramatically, and we suspect this means that being food insecure is now associated with even greater nutritional compromises.  Using data from 2015, we will analyze the relationship between food insecurity and nutritional vulnerability, and we will compare our findings to those from 2004.  By generating an evidence-based understanding the implications of household food insecurity for the nutritional health of adults and children currently, our research will help to define priorities for interventions to address this problem."

Food insecurity is more prevalent among households with children, and our recent exploratory study suggests that pregnancy and child birth may be associated with even higher risk. Food insecurity among pregnant women is concerning because food insecurity is associated with poor health and increased health care costs.  It may pose serious risks to the health of newborns, negatively affecting their health through childhood and beyond.  However, in Canada, there has been little research examining food insecurity during pregnancy or early life. In this study, we will use national survey data and health care data from Ontario to examine the relationship between household food insecurity and maternal and infant health. We will also determine the magnitude and severity of the food insecurity among pregnant women across Canada and identify what puts them at risk of food insecurity. Currently, there are no policy interventions designed explicitly to address food insecurity during pregnancy. This research into the origins and implications of food insecurity for pregnancy and child birth in Canada will importantly help to set priorities and identify directions for interventions in the future.  Our research findings will also be used to develop guidelines for physicians and other health care providers to help them respond more effectively to women who are food insecure during pregnancy."

However, we do not have a good understanding of why so many families in Canada are struggling to afford the food they need or how family food insecurity affects children's nutritional health. This study will use data from several large population-representative surveys to answer two research questions: i) how does household food insecurity relate to children's long-term nutritional health, as indicated by their height and weight, and ii) which children are most at risk of household food insecurity and why?

In 2017-18, over 4.4 million Canadians were affected by food insecurity and this number appears to have risen through the COVID-19 pandemic. This is concerning because  compared to other Canadians, those who are food insecure have poorer physical and mental health and much higher risks of chronic disease and premature death. So, food insecurity places a heavy burden on our health care system. Losses in employment incomes through the pandemic could be expected to increase household food insecurity in Canada, but the extent to which these hardships have been offset by federal income and wage subsidy programs is unknown. We will analyze national population survey data collected from 2019 through 2021 to identify the household circumstances and employment conditions associated with household food insecurity before and during the pandemic.

Reducing Food Insecurity through Canada's Poverty Reduction Strategy,"['Tarasuk, Valerie S', 'Heisz, Andrew']","['Dutton, Daniel J', 'Fafard St-Germain, AndrÃ©e-Anne', 'Gundersen, Craig', 'Saul, Nick', 'Wasylko, Myron']","['Food Insecurity', 'Poverty Reduction']",438008.0,501612,"Household food insecurity, the inadequate or insecure access to food because of financial constraints, is a serious public health problem in Canada. It has now reached a record high, affecting almost 1 in 5 Canadians. Food banks typically see only a small fraction of those who are food-insecure, but they are now overwhelmed with demands for assistance. Food insecurity has been recognized as a matter of concern in several federal, provincial, and territorial policy documents, but Canada still has no strategy to deal with this problem. As the number of Canadians experiencing food insecurity rises, the need for policy actions to address the underlying causes of this problem has never been more apparent. 

Because households' food security is tightly linked to their financial circumstances, the logical policy to address food insecurity is the federal government's Poverty Reduction Strategy. This strategy has been effective in reducing poverty through the introduction of the Canada Child Benefit and pandemic-related supports like the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. But food insecurity has still escalated. We think this is because a household's chance of being food insecure is driven not only by their income, but also by their assets and debt (which are not counted in calculations of poverty). We also know that households are more likely to be food insecure if they have recently endured job loss, sudden increases in expenses, or other changes that have increased their financial precarity. 

Working in partnership with Employment and Social Development Canada, Statistics Canada, and Community Food Centres Canada, we propose to analyze several years of income data for participants in the Canadian Income Survey to better understand how households' current and recent past economic circumstances predict their risk of being food insecure. We will use our results to identify policies in the Poverty Reduction Strategy that can reduce food insecurity in Canada."

The news media has been quick to cater to this interest by producing many reports on health and medical issues. Every day new health research studies are covered in the media worldwide. One day you may read coffee is bad for your health; the next day you'll hear the same cup of java reduces your risk of disease. How does one sort through the complex and often conflicting world of scientific research to make sound health decisions? The media has incredible influence over public perception: nearly nine out of 10 Canadians make decisions affecting their health as a direct result of media reports on health and health research. However, due to the complexity of health science, and poor reporting practices, these reports often contain skewed facts or conflicting data. The Canadian Cochrane Centre (CCC) supports media sharing health information, but lobbies for responsible reporting based on the totality of evidence. While many health writers take care to ensure their writing is informed by the best available evidence, this is not always the case. But, just as journalists should use many types of information and sources to produce stories, the public should seek to verify what they see and read in the media. This CafÃ© Scientifique is an opportunity to educate the public to interpret health and medical media reports with caution while using critical appraisal skills to distinguish responsible reporting from sensationalized and misinformed journalism. The CCC will discuss examples of health news stories to identify problematic reporting practices while presenting trusted information sources the public can use to validate media reports, including The Cochrane Library. This event will provide a discussion forum where researchers and the public alike can exchange ideas about health reporting in an open environment."

A large body of research consistently demonstrates positive outcomes for psychotherapy, yet there remains a recognized gap between research and practice. We argue that creating a network of psychotherapists and researchers in Canada who come together to engage in practice-based research will not only lead to the creation of important new research knowledge but will also improve uptake of current knowledge by clinicians and increase clinician interest in knowledge translation (KT). We will achieve the goal of this planning grant by: (1) enlisting 60 to 70 practicing psychotherapists, educators, stakeholder groups, and researchers to join a PPRN; (2) engaging in a deliberative priority setting process with these clinicians, educators, stakeholder groups, and researchers to collaboratively define psychotherapy research priorities for Canadians; and (3) identifying barriers and facilitators to PPRN research in clinical practice. Having clinicians as equal partners in defining research priorities will improve research uptake into clinical practice. Engaging educators and professional stakeholder groups will have an impact on education and professional practice standards. Developing a sustainable PPRN will result in integrated KT and in a practice-based research community that will continue to overcome the barriers to uptake of psychotherapy research into clinical practice."

SGBV against migrant and refugee women is widespread, but often remains invisible and under-analysed both in academic research and policy-making. This research will take an intersectional approach to understand SGBV in the context of migration, analysing the ways in which discriminations and inequalities based on gender, race, nationality, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity and age, interact to make certain women more vulnerable to SGBV and less able to access support and services for survivors than others. SGBV may be exacerbated by policies aiming to restrict migration, or to increase control of borders, which can push women into adopting dangerous routes to arrive in their country of destination. Conflict and the risks of migration may also render women vulnerable to trafficking and sexual exploitation. Conditions of reception, and policies for integration in receiving countries may also lead to increased risk of SGBV for migrant and refugee women. But these women are not just ""victims"", and their strategies and agency should also be explored. In sum while we know that female migrants and refugees are particularly exposed to violence we lack a systematic understanding of the underlying dynamics that (re)produce patterns of violence. It is this gap that the research seeks to fill in order to make policy recommendations for reducing these women's vulnerability to SGBV and increasing their access to services."

Some enjoy good health right up to the end, while others are ill or incapacitated for a long period of time, and then just slip away. The ability of a person to perform their normal activities of daily living (a.k.a. ""functional capacity"") is key to the lives of older people, since researchers have found it to relate to important things like death, nursing home admissions, and hospitalization. That said, the research on functional capacity as we get progressively older is sparse. Important questions remain, such as how different chronic diseases (and combinations thereof) affect our late-life pathways; and how being on diverse pathways can have different implications for health and well-being. 

The Manitoba Follow-up Study (MFUS) is one of the longest-running studies of health and aging in the world. MFUS has been following the same group of 3,983 men since 1948. From a mean age of 30 years, there are still about 250 men alive, now at a mean age of 94 years. Using already-collected MFUS data, we will investigate whether and how previous disease diagnoses affect the late-life mental and physical pathways of older men, and we will consider whether and how changing life circumstances (such as moving to assisted living or death of a spouse) influence the late-life pathways to ultimately affect men's quality of life. 

Our findings will provide valuable insight for care providers, health care professionals and policy makers, 'to do their job'. Our findings will inform customized resource planning and health care provision for older men who are navigating different pathways towards the upper reaches of the life course."

Loneliness has been associated with worse health and well-being among older adults. One way that loneliness may influence health is through the accumulation of prolonged stress (or allostatic load) which impairs healthy biological functioning of multiple systems in our bodies (including cardiovascular and immune systems), and in turn, contributes to chronic diseases over time. Recent research suggests that loneliness has been linked with an increased stress response (e.g., higher blood pressure, activation of the immune system), with limited attention to chronic stress. Previous research in this area has been inconclusive regarding differences by sex. Both social support and sleep have been found to reduce the negative effects of stress on health; however, these pathways have not been adequately examined with respect to loneliness and allostatic load among older adults. 

Using a large prospective study of older adults, the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging, our study will illustrate how loneliness may 'get under the skin', and whether these pathways may differ by sex. We will also demonstrate potential pathways that may dampen the relationship between loneliness and stress, specifically through social support and sleep. This study will be among the first to clarify how loneliness may impact health through prolonged stress and will be useful for informing future public health interventions and improving population health."

Understanding children's perceived barriers to physical activity in varying environments.,"['Taylor, Leah']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,383060,"Canadian children are not active enough to reap health benefits of physical activity (PA). This has been identified as a national health crisis due to the related increases in health and wellbeing related issues. Researchers suggest children's perceptions of their everyday environments may be equally important as environmental factors alone for predicting PA. While research related to children's perceptions of PA barriers exists, there is little focusing on children in non-urban communities of Canada. Our study examines the diversity of children's experiences of barriers to PA in the integrated social and environmental contexts of their communities. Our objective was to use a socio-ecological framework (SEF) to demonstrate how intrapersonal, interpersonal, and physical environment levels influence children's perceptions of barriers to PA. We analyzed results from a survey conducted in a population-based study, which took place in Southwestern Ontario (2010-2013), and Northern Ontario (2016). We used a series of binary logistic regression models and odds ratios to measure the relationship between children's perceptions of barriers to PA within the SEF. At the intrapersonal level, older children, girls, and visible minorities reported the most barriers to PA. At the interpersonal level, maternal employment and lone parent households had the strongest influence on perception of barriers.  At the physical environment level, children in urban and suburban large cities, and rural areas were more likely to report barriers, however these differed relative to population size. The results while consistent with previous research on children's barriers to PA, highlight the importance of considering the variety of contexts of children's PA behaviour, when attempting to address inactivity. We call health professionals, urban planners, and researchers for intersectoral action to strengthen the coherence of strategies to mitigate barriers to most effectively impact children's PA."

Research has shown that participating in age-appropriate physical activity, sedentary time, and healthy sleep, as recommended by the Canadian 24-Hour Movement Guidelines (the Guidelines), has led to healthy development in kids. However, a gap exists in the current research regarding the applicability of these guidelines for children with a disability. This is a problem because engagement in regular physical activity and healthy sleep habits have been linked with health-related benefits, and  with kids' abilities to complete their daily occupations. Therefore, this research will examine if adherence to the Guidelines plays a role in improving occupational skills in children aged 2-5 with disabilities, and the suitability of the Guidelines for occupational therapy practice. This will be assessed with three questions:
 
1. Do children with a disability adhere to the Guidelines (before intervention)?
2. Does following the Guidelines lead to improved occupational skills (e.g., playing, learning, and socializing)? 
3. What are occupational therapists' perspectives of a prescribed movement program for children with disabilities?

The results will aid occupational therapists in understanding the role of movement in occupational skill participation.  As a result, this research will have important implications for treatment practices in paediatric care and health outcomes in disabilities studies."

By doing this, we identified some of the barriers and opportunities facing food entrepreneurs in the region. The themes we identified from the participants included: 1) A need for support for entrepreneurs during the beginning stages of business development 2) An interest in formally organized groups enabling government workers and business owners to work together in the interest of food business innovation 3) The potential for city funds to be used for new food business and 4) Support for new entrepreneurs to understand and fulfill the needs of government policies when starting a business. This research led to the discovery that there are mutual interests and shared ideas in entrepreneur communities and the government sector. Participants expressed multiple innovative suggestions for improvement within the region. This research has helped develop a more complete picture of the experience of health food entrepreneurs and those in the government working with them. This research has the potential to positively impact entrepreneurs through the implementation of recommendations of nurturing policies. If these policies are successful, health food entrepreneurs will flourish, and thus health food access, and health within the region will be drastically improved."

Since 2018, in partnership with the Canadian Foundation for AIDS Research (CANFAR), SExT has toured nationally to regions most affected by HIV/AIDS and STBBI outbreaks, reaching over 6400 students across Ontario, Saskatchewan, and the Northwest Territories (NWT). In response to COVID-19, SExT partnered with Connected North, a cutting-edge program by Cisco and TakingITGlobal that provides an accessible digital platform through high definition, two-way TelePresence video technology. This study will engage Indigenous youth in Northern communities in a trauma-informed, culturally-safe, and virtual adaptation of the SExT intervention. Virtual workshops will involve interactive performances and theatre exercises led by SExT peer educators. Realist evaluation will unpack the mechanisms of how participatory remote online delivery of SExT works in particular contexts. Pre-post surveys with students and educators will assess self-reported changes in knowledge, attitudes, and intended behaviours. t-tests and ANOVA will determine pre-post changes, differences between virtual and live conditions (live data previously collected), and demographic differences. Focus groups will be held with students and data analyzed through an iterative process using thematic analysis. Findings will be used to improve the intervention model and scale-up. SExT's ongoing national touring activities and COVID-19 related pivot to the digital space provide an unprecedented possibility to explore the opportunities and challenges associated with virtual delivery of arts-based sexual health promotion in remote Indigenous contexts."
Reformulating 'Inclusion': a study with non-speaking disabled youth,"['Teachman, Gail']",['N/A'],['Ics'],1000.0,324074,"Social 'inclusion' is a notion that is idealized and shapes our thinking about people as insiders or outsiders. Even as healthcare aims for inclusion of people with disabilities, it is not clear what types of inclusion contribute to their health and well-being. In this presentation we explore inclusion through research with 13 Canadian disabled youth who had little or no speech. Research participants used augmentative and alternative communication including speech-generating devices, personal communication assistants, gestures, or facial expressions that were combined to substitute for speech. In the study we developed innovative interview, photo and visual methods that were combined to describe participants' daily activities, social networks, and their everyday environments. We examined the ways that prevalent understandings of inclusion and exclusion influenced youth with disabilities, and showed how they reformulated imposed notions of inclusion. In social settings assumed to be inclusive, youth were often marginalized, although they had come to accept this as natural and necessary. In mainstream settings where youth were physically included, they felt socially excluded and treated as invisible or even inhuman. In their efforts to feel included and valued, youth emphasized their positive traits, minimized their impairments and pointed out they were ""the same on the inside"". Together with their families, they invested extraordinary efforts to create positive spaces of inclusion on their own terms. The research contributes understandings of social inclusion as a complex and subjective process. Our study results can be used to better inform inclusion-focused programs and policies. We also contribute new methods to include people with communication impairments in research."

The findings will impact understandings of social inclusion and exclusion and will inform clinical practice as well as health, education and social policy with a view to increasing participation and maximizing the health and well-being of children with complex communication needs. Strategies for sharing the study results will include formats that are engaging and accessible for children and youth."
Co-producing knowledge of disabled youth's 'everyday pain': A multimedia storytelling project informed by disability studies perspectives,"['Teachman, Gail']","['Birnie, Kathryn A', 'Mah, Katherine', 'Servais, Michelle', 'Smart, Eric', 'Webster, Fiona']","['Arts-Based Research', 'Disability', 'Impairment', 'Pain', 'Youth']",317476.0,500875,"Experiences of 'everyday pain' among youth living with impairments and disability remain underrecognized, understudied, and undertreated. Left unmanaged, everyday pain, which includes care-related pain, in youth can have debilitating and lifelong effects. It can lead to poor developmental, academic and social outcomes, and an increased risk of chronic pain in adulthood. Our team's research, which brings disability studies into conversation with health sciences, suggests that the invisibility of everyday pain for this group is influenced by assumptions that pain is an inevitable part of living with disability. Such assumptions may contribute to everyday pain being taken-for-granted by clinicians, researchers, and even disabled youth themselves. This participatory arts-based study will recruit disabled youth (aged 16-24 years) who experience everyday pain to learn directly from them, producing knowledge that can improve pain-related care for this population. Through a series of online workshops, participants will take on roles as 'storytellers' and will be supported to produce short videos that narrate their stories of everyday pain. A Youth Advisory Panel will work alongside our team providing essential guidance to ensure the study aligns with their priorities and concerns. To enrich the study results for application to practice, the multimedia stories will be shared through a series of online focus groups with knowledge-users (e.g. disabled youth, parents, clinicians, decision-makers). Study results, including the multimedia stories, will be widely shared using formats suited to a range of audiences, including the general public. This research will make pain experienced by disabled visible and add improved understandings of everyday pain that can improve pain-related practices in children's rehabilitation and healthcare. Results will include actionable recommendations for addressing the real world concerns of young Canadians living with disability and everyday pain."
Patterns and predictors of exposure to household air pollution and its cardiovascular impacts among rural Chinese,"['Tedoff, Pauley']",['N/A'],"['Biomass', 'Canada', 'China', 'Household Air Pollution', 'Household Energy', 'Indoor Air Pollution', 'Particulate Matter', 'Personal Exposure Assessment', 'Quebec', 'Solid Fuels']",150000.0,318300,"Almost half the world's population cooks with biomass and coal in inefficient stoves that emit high concentrations of toxic pollutants (Bonjour et al. 2013). The resulting household air pollution (HAP) is estimated to be the fourth leading risk factor for the global burden of disease, responsible for 3.5 million yearly premature deaths (Lim et al. 2013). In China, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death (Yang et al., 2013), with evidence that HAP from traditional wood and coal stoves is a significant environmental contributor to high blood pressure in the country (Baumgartner et al. 2011). Yet despite HAP's importance, only a small number of studies have measured personal HAP exposure and estimated its impacts on human health. The lack of data is largely due to financial and logistical barriers to measuring exposure in rural, low-income settings where HAP levels are highest. The proposed study will thus focus on determining the association between HAP exposure and cardiovascular function among Chinese men and women in three geographically and socioeconomically diverse field sites in China, taking into consideration seasonal, geographic, and sociodemographic differences. Following analysis, the study will generate recommendations for the development of effective strategies to reduce HAP risks, as well as inform national policy and standards in China and globally."

It is known that Indigenous youth are struggling to create a salient identity in a colonized world, and this is negatively impacting their health and wellness. However, what is not known is the extent to which interactions within the digital world are contributing to this process. In this project, we will be partnering with the Aboriginal Programs and Services center at UBC Okanagan to engage young Indigenous men from the local school district in an Indigenous-led participatory project. The participants will meet as a group in open sharing circle discussions about how interactions in the digital world shape who they are as Indigenous youths and the impacts that this may have on their health and wellness. Specifically, we will be asking the group members to report what they see when exploring the digital world including what types of digital platforms they are using. The group will then critically reflect about what they see, make notes of their encounters, and return to the group the following session ready to discuss their notes. Ultimately, we will be looking to answer the question, how do digital representations of Indigenous masculinity affect their sense of self, health, and wellness? This project will be infused with Indigenous knowledge and traditions to accommodate the worldview of Indigenous peoples, where the information presented by the group members will be assessed in a critical, Indigenous masculinity, and decolonial lens. This project is a preliminary phase of an Indigenous focused community-based participatory program that will look to create guidelines for Indigenous male youth to protect their health and wellness while they use the digital world for educational/recreational purposes."

These are worrisome as they are linked to higher rates of diseases in later life for both the mother and the baby, and even death. Modifications to the mother's diet before pregnancy may prevent complications from occurring. Diet is difficult to measure correctly with traditional research methods, which are burdensome for study participants. New technologies such as mobile phone applications, used worldwide, allow to measure diet more easily and have the potential to improve it. However, this remains to be proven. My first objective is to implement and evaluate the feasibility of using the photo-based mobile food diary I co-developed (Keenoa) to track diet in 5,000 participants of a unique digital study part of a large American cohort. My next objective is to evaluate if Keenoa and a mobile diet survey (Beiwe) are accurate methods to evaluate diet when compared to a traditional method. To this end, I will apply statistical analyses to compare participants intake in nutrients, such as calories and protein reported using the different methods. Lastly, I aim to identify diets that may be linked to lower rates of complications during pregnancy. Using novel statistical analyses, I will examine women's dietary intake data and complications of 38,527 pregnancies from the same large American cohort. This research will permit to find dietary patterns that may favour an overall healthy pregnancy and provide novel insights to advise recommendations; upon the accumulation of evidence, it may be a strategy for women planning a pregnancy to modify their diet during periconception. Together, my studies will serve to inform the design of future intervention and large cohort studies in North America and similar populations; and national surveys, such as the Canadian Health Measures Survey."

So we need to learn if and how these bacteria change as a child grows, and what kind of bacteria and at what age of a child can influence if the child gets asthma or not. Scientists started to learn about bacteria that live in human body relatively recently, so we still do not know much about how to better use numbers obtained in laboratory tests (like numbers doctors get in blood tests) for explaining how disease develops. So the main question of the research project will be how can we use laboratory test results about bacteria to see if children with and without asthma had different kinds of bacteria in different ages. We will use statistics and mathematics to create equations describing how these numbers change. We will put results of different laboratory tests in the same equations, because different tests describe different ways in which bacteria change in time. And then we will see if these changes are different for children with and without asthma. This will help to decide what treatments or lifestyle changes and at what age are needed to ensure a child does not get asthma."

Strategies for the Identification and Prevention of Performance-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders in Musicians,"['Thacker, Linnea']",['N/A'],"['Knowledge Translation', ""Musicians' Health"", ""Musicians' Injuries"", 'Performance-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders', 'Population Health', 'Qualitative Methods']",105000.0,307747,"Performance-related musculoskeletal disorders (PRMDs) and playing-related pain are conditions from which musicians frequently suffer in silence, and as such, the incidence rate has long been underestimated. Recent research is beginning to illuminate the tremendous scope of the problem and suggests that the overwhelming majority (upwards of 80 percent) of musicians report having experienced playing-related pain or injuries. While there has been a recent increase in the medical understanding of PRMDs, there remains a gap both in the literature and in practice regarding the prevention of PRMDs and other musicians' injuries.

This investigation aims to develop and test the effectiveness of a curriculum and resource package that contribute to the development of improved physical and psychological wellbeing, decreased playing-related pain, and strengthened musical and technical ability in musicians. This investigation comprises two parts: 1) A resource package will be developed by compiling advice given by medical practitioners who work with injured musicians. 2) Undergraduate violin students at the University of Toronto will be given weekly additional violin lessons over the course of 12 weeks. Half of the participants will receive conventional lessons while the other half receive lessons that include instruction in body awareness and anatomy, and address the advice given by the medical practitioners.

It is believed that the participants who receive body awareness instruction will report improved physical and psychological wellbeing, decreased playing-related pain, and increased musical and technical ability.

As we learn more about the overwhelming prevalence of PRMDs, it is becoming increasingly apparent that we must invest in preventative strategies. The approach taken in this proposed investigation focuses on translating medical knowledge into practical application by music instructors, thereby filling a profound gap in the current approach to PRMDs."

Ottawa pioneered the use of environmental surveillance, through wastewater signals, to predict COVID-19 disease burden in the community and inform the local public health response at a broad level. Building on previous work in hospitals, our study team addresses an important gap in surveillance: schools, childcare and long-term care settings.

Most children and youth with COVID-19 will have few or no symptoms, yet they could still face considerable disruption to learning and potential hospitalization for their illness. Conversely, the risk of morbidity and mortality is highest in the older frail adult population. Testing for COVID-19 has been recommended to break chains of transmissions in classroom cohorts and congregate living settings. Yet testing students remains challenging because of difficulties in accessibility, acceptability of sampling methods, and the ability to screen low-risk students in schools serving communities with high rates of COVID-19. In long-term care, there is additional concern of waning immunity among staff and residents who were vaccinated more than six months ago, increasing residents' vulnerability to infection from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals. 

Our method of environmental sampling of floors could improve upon the spatial resolution of wastewater surveillance while focusing human testing only where it is needed. We will draw from vaccination rates to also provide insights into the SARS-CoV-2 environmental burden in a vaccinated population (such as high schools, long-term care), as testing criteria may evolve and no longer reflect infection prevalence, and at a finer spatial scale than conventional wastewater sampling."

The aim of this research is to support Indigenous youth, ages 12-17, as they 'age-out-of-care' in making healthy lifestyle choices that can impact their mental health and overall wellbeing while preventing chronic illness later in life.
three areas of focus include:
Implementation research based on implementation science and Indigenous holistic concepts of health to produce evidence of scalable and sustainable interventions that support the healthy lifestyle choices of Indigenous youth as they 'age-out-of-care' to an urban setting; 
Strengthen and build the capacity of health practitioners and trainees in implementation science and enhancement of services and resources to support the mental health and wellbeing of Indigenous youth; and,
Mobilize evidence-based outcomes to support Canadian cities in planning and implementing a model and framework unique to urban contexts and needs of the Indigenous youth, who will 'age-out-of-care' to an urban setting."

Impact of a health hygiene education intervention on absenteeism rates in grade 5 students of the Peruvian Amazon,"['ThÃ©riault, FranÃ§ois']",['N/A'],"['Absenteeism', 'Disease Prevention', 'Global Health', 'Health Promotion', 'Hygiene Education', 'Intervention Research', 'Millennium Development Goals', 'Parasitic Diseases', 'Population Health', 'School-Aged Children']",17500.0,252423,"The aim of my proposed research is to see if enhanced hygiene education can reduce absenteeism in students living in an impoverished area in the Peruvian Amazon where worm infections are highly endemic. The number of worms in an infected child can range from one to hundreds, causing symptoms of varying severity.  Some children do not attend school because of worm infections.  It is therefore critical that worm infections be treated and that children learn how to prevent becoming re-infected.  

Unhygienic behaviours like not washing hands and walking barefoot lead to frequent contact with fecally-contaminated soil, thus increasing the risk of worm infections. If education programs encourage the modification of high risk behaviours, the transmission of worm infections could be reduced and a positive impact could be observed in reducing absenteeism rates.

Using a database where 1,438 Grade 5 students in 18 elementary schools in Belen had participated in an earlier study in 2010, my research question will specifically compare absenteeism rates in those children attending schools who had received an enhanced hygiene educational intervention integrated into their school curriculum (N=9)with children attending schools who had not received such an educational intervention (N=9).

Complementing this data analysis, I will travel to Peru to conduct interviews with teachers and students in the same schools that had participated in the earlier study to see if the educational intervention is still being integrated into the school curriculum and if teachers and students feel that it continues to have an impact on hygiene behaviours. By documenting the impact of such an educational intervention on absenteeism rates, this research will contribute field evidence on a sustainable and easily-implemented public health intervention which has the potential to make an important impact in the lives of millions of schoolchildren who live in worm-endemic areas of the world."

Recently a large ZEBOV outbreak in Western Africa has caused severe morbidity and mortality. The international community has mustered a strong response to aid the greatly inflicted countries of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The scale of the current epidemic has increased the need for understanding environmental persistence of the virus and the effectiveness of current decontamination and infection control protocols.  These three topics require additional investigation due to a lack of knowledge in the field of filovirus environmental biology and their relation to the transmission of the virus in nosocomial and communal settings. Our research focuses on providing up to date quantitative evidence for the environmental persistence and disinfection of the Ebola virus. To address this topic we propose a set of three experiments: 1) determination of the Ebola Virus' environmental persistence, 2) testing the efficacy of commonly used disinfectants against the virus and 3) evaluating the degree of protection personal protective equipment (PPE) affords to the wearer. All three of these experiments depend on a published methodology named, ""quantitative carrier test-two"" which was designed to detect and quantify the survival of biological agents suspended in liquid medium on a solid surface. Importantly, the procedure allows for the testing of Ebola virus survival and disinfection on any surface making evaluation of PPE possible."

About 50% of young people report having intention to lose weight and 20% of them are concerned about their weight. Weight-related intention may be a determinant of behavioral weight-related actions. Objectives: This study aims to assess the influence of a change in body image on weight-related intentions and the influence of weight-related intentions on lifestyle and adiposity. Methodology: The data for this study will be drawn from the MATCH study, a prospective study of 937 young people from New Brunswick followed 3 times a year for 8 years (aged 10 to 18) and the NDIT study, a longitudinal study of 1,293 young people from MontrÃ©al followed for 17 years (13 to 30 years old). Relevance: This doctoral project is unique in that it will provide a broad and longitudinal understanding of the influence of weight-related intentions on lifestyle and health of adolescents and young adults.

Name of Program: Schulich Interfaculty Program in Public Health.

The Schulich Interfaculty Program in Public Health's MPH is designed to fill a novel niche at the intersection of leadership, policy and sustainability within the Canadian health care system as well as more globally. A unique aspect of this program is that students will go through the entire program as a cohort, where together they will learn about public health. Students will benefit from a small class where a collaborative learning environment will be fostered. The inaugural class began September 1, 2013.

The MPH program is an interdisciplinary, interfaculty program with teh support of the following Faculties at Western: Health Sciences, Law, Science, Social Science, Ivey School of Business and Brescia University College. The program will prepare students to address public health challenges in Canada and abroad, thus opening avenues and opportunities for the students to serve not just in their local communities, but also contribute and lead in national and global public health initiatives as change agents."
Supporting Inuit youth engagement in participatory action research: Conceptualizing a strengths-based engagement model with and for Inuit communities in Nunavut,"['Thomas, Alaina']",['N/A'],"['Herringbone Stitch Model', 'Inuit Resilience', 'Inuit Youth Engagement', 'Participatory Action Research', 'Relational-Developmental Systems Resilience Framework', 'Suicide Prevention', 'Thriving']",105000.0,497162,"Engaging Inuit youth in community-driven programming has been deemed a top priority by community leaders. Not only does engagement lead to more enduring program outcomes, but it may also serve as a protective mechanism against suicidality. Sustained engagement of Inuit youth in community-based research is nevertheless challenging, with various studies reporting high attrition and inconsistent participation. Few studies have investigated strategies to enhance Inuit youth engagement. Existing research is limited to environmental science and focuses solely on physical and educational barriers to participation. The purpose of the proposed doctoral dissertation is to explore multi-systemic factors that support active and long-term engagement of Inuit youth in participatory action, mental wellness research. To do this, I will examine the engagement patterns of 20 Inuit youth leaders involved in a CIHR-funded participatory action research initiative (Inuit youth develop a Virtual Qaggiq). Over the course of three years (2023-2027), I aim to (1) explore and consolidate Inuit youth's understandings of meaningful engagement, (2) identify the discrete factors contributing to youths' continuous participation in the project, as well as the recurring hindrances, (3) and develop a culturally specific conceptual model of engagement, grounded in a relational-developmental systems (RDS) resilience framework. It is hoped this study will support Nunavummiut's understanding of how to increase the presence and voice of Inuit youth in community-led initiatives, contribute to the continuity and sustainability of community-based action, illuminate the role of engagement in youth suicide prevention, and deepen our knowledge of Inuit resilience. The results from this project will give rise to a model for engaging Inuit youth that may benefit areas outside mental wellness research, including youth engagement in schools and government."

Patients with inflammatory arthritis have different health outcomes, and many of these differences are because of factors out of their control, such as their race, gender identity, or age, to name a few. Most research done in this field shows more data for patients who are white than other races, but we also are missing information on differences in health outcomes that are because of age, gender identity, location, education, or other factors. It is important to look at this topic because we need to understand how healthcare services may be disadvantaging or harming certain people. 

We need to work with patients to figure out how to recruit people into more studies trying to address this topic, and the first step is to set up a patient advisory committee. At the same time, we need to look at the research already done and work with this committee to discover how we can recruit patients with consideration for diversity factors (equity). We plan to hold a large meeting with patients, and content experts, to create strategies on how to recruit patients with inflammatory arthritis for future research in a way that lets us consider age, gender, or other equity factors.

This research is important to patients with inflammatory arthritis, and healthcare providers. By identifying how to recruit patients based on these different factors, we can hopefully begin improving access to care for all patients with inflammatory arthritis."

However, numerous drug safety issues have arisen in the recent past that threaten to undermine public trust in government regulatory systems. Health Canada's ongoing shift towards a life-cycle approach to drug regulation provides an opportunity to identify current and future ethical concerns that can inform this evolution of the regulatory and post-market research system in Canada that aims to protect the public from actual and potential harms arising from safety and efficacy issues. This research aims to develop an empirically informed, stakeholder-vetted ethical framework for post-market drug regulation and research in Canada that can improve the legitimacy of processes and outcomes of the regulatory system."

The decrease of health issues in Aboriginal peoples can contribute to the reduction of health inequities, an important public health concern and priority research area. There have been various approaches used to address health issues within Aboriginal communities that have produced mixed results. A review of knowledge-to-action models and frameworks found community engagement, cultural considerations, and different knowledge types crucial for intervention success. However, no model was found that encompassed all the characteristics that support health equity. This review also identified the importance of frontline worker input in all phases of the intervention process, but many of the frameworks did not include this essential group. Currently, there is no comprehensive framework for those working in Aboriginal communities to decrease the burden of health challenges that includes the recommended features from the literature and frontline worker input. Based on findings from the literature and frontline worker input, a participatory action research approach will be used to develop a new framework to incorporate frontline worker experiences addressing multiple health issues within Aboriginal communities.

The SHA is committed to truth and reconciliation and that includes fostering culturally safe care for Indigenous families to reduce access barriers and improve health outcomes. With these goals, examining the experiences of Indigenous families is essential to provide culturally safe child health clinics within the SHA. This study proposes to collect data through a survey and then apply the survey results to inform focus groups, and interviews with families and frontline workers, i.e., public health nurses, community program builders, and office administrative assistants to answer the following research questions: (1) what are the factors that support immunization for families with children 0-6 years of age in the Health Networks in and around Saskatoon, SK?; (2) What are the factors contributing to low immunization rates?; (3) How can immunization health services be modified and improved? To work in a good way with the community partner, the SHA, a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach will be applied. A Research Advisory Committee has been formed with SHA leadership, engagement with the First Nations and Metis Health Services, and current recruitment of Indigenous Knowledge Keepers, and family partners.

Educational attainment is a key marker for future health mediated through work and economic resources and supports for healthy lifestyles. Substance use in adolescence is also an important risk factor for adverse health outcomes in adulthood. Early substance use is a risk factor for developing substance abuse and dependence in adulthood, which can affect ones health as well as their economic position. To date however, what we know about the links between education, substance use and health in young adults has mainly come from retrospective or cross-sectional studies. We know little about how particular substance use patterns and educational attainment in adolescence interact and determine physical and mental health in adulthood. While it has been shown that substance use and educational success in adolescence are inversely related with each other, few studies have examined their interrelationships in a longitudinal perspective. It is possible that substance use is just a marker for a host of risk and protective factors such as parenting styles or household income - or, alternatively, some patterns of substance use directly impair school performance. I have an opportunity to use a data set that has followed a group of young people age 12-16 through into adulthood (age 22-28). This data set will enable me to use advanced statistical analysis to clarify the unique role of substance use and educational pathways in the prediction of health outcomes in young adulthood. Further, this study will examine how substance use and education fit into the larger matrix of individual (i.e. healthy lifestyle) and contextual factors (i.e. peer group) that influence health in young adults. Understanding these relationships will contribute to the knowledge that is needed to guide services and policies that will support healthy transitions to adulthood."
HIV Epidemic Diversity Among High Risk Populations in Pakistan,"['Thompson, Laura H']",['N/A'],"['Epidemiology', 'Hiv', 'Injection Drug Users', 'Molecular Epidemiology', 'Network Analysis', 'Pakistan', 'Sex Workers', 'Transmission Dynamics']",105000.0,272929,"Pakistan has substantial heterogeneity in HIV prevalence and risk behaviors across different geographic areas and high risk populations. HIV prevalence has reached 50% among injection drug users in some areas and is recently beginning to appear among sex workers - large populations representing significant potential for transmission to the general population. Little is understood about the diversity and trajectory of HIV epidemics in Pakistan.
This project will investigate and characterize HIV transmission chains in Pakistan using molecular, behavioural and social network data. By sequencing particular genes isolated from HIV specimens of a sample of infected individuals and grouping them according to sequence similarities, clusters of closely related HIV strains can be identified. Clusters represent specimens that share a common ancestor and therefore are part of the same transmission chain (subepidemic). Clusters may differ a lot in terms of trajectory, population membership and size, behaviours and geographic location and may therefore require unique HIV prevention program configurations in optimal locations targeting that specific transmission chain. Cluster features also reveal the success of interventions, as large clusters suggest that transmission has not been abated. Transmission routes may be further described using network data, which indicates sexual and injection bridging between individuals. 
I propose to perform molecular analysis on specimens isolated from dry blood spots from injection drug users in 2011 and 2013 and female, male, and transgender sex workers in 2011 and link these results to accompanying behavioural and geographic data. In 2013 sexual and injection network data among injection drug users will also be collected. This project will provide a uniquely comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneity and population dynamics of HIV subepidemics in Pakistan, which will be critical to strategically design targeted HIV prevention programs."

Could one form of risky behaviour (e.g. sport) substitute for the other, more health-detrimental form (e.g. drugs)?   

The 'high', the sensation of excitement, is related to the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine.  My interdisciplinary project involves: 1) looking for variants in the dopamine receptor gene that are characteristic of risk-inclined populations, 2) personality trait correlations between risk-inclined populations in sports and 'on the street', and 3) an investigation of the potential of 'adventure-based' interventions in dealing with substance abuse.

The association between genetic variants in the dopamine receptor and related genes and SS behaviour will be assessed in a number of risk-inclined sports populations including extreme skiers, 'BASE jumpers', in substance abusers, and in a control population.  Personality and genetic variables between the groups will also be analyzed which hopefully will contribute to a theoretical understanding of the innate factors that may influence SS.  The final phase will look at a potential application of theory by investigating an established adventure-based learning program for at-risk youth called Take a Hike.  Pre- and post- program lifestyle data will be used to gauge the efficacy of the program in reducing drug-abuse.  Perhaps the 'extreme' sports alternative will appeal to youth otherwise inclined to satisfy SS urges through drugs."

Most of these young people have experienced some form of trauma and really struggle with challenges around mental health and substance use. We also know that young people continue to struggle once they leave homelessness; many continue to live in poverty and feel very isolated and lonely. 

COVID-19 has highlighted that this pandemic is negatively impacting some more than others. This is particularly true for the young people we serve. Many have lost jobs, do not feel safe where they are isolating, or feel a bit lost without any day-to-day structure. At the same time, physical distancing measures mean most places providing mental health and substance use supports are closed. 

Still, despite these challenges, we are hearing from our colleagues on the front lines that some are trying really innovative things to connect with young people who have experienced or are experiencing homelessness. In fact, we believe that some of these ideas may be really forward thinking and should continue after the pandemic is over. 

We want to do three things: 
1) Send out an electronic survey to folks across Canada working with young people who are experiencing or have experienced homelessness to understand how they have adapted their practices. 
2) Do a ""deeper dive"" and interview those who are doing particularly innovative things to understand what seems to be working well and for whom (e.g., youth who identify as female vs. youth who identify as male).

The study uses a participatory, mixed methods research design to evaluate an innovative outreach approach to improving health. Background: Despite recent gains in addressing health inequities, many Aboriginal women continue to experience the negative health effects of injustices, which can lead to increased risk for HIV infection.  Research continues to show that access to PHC is key to improving population health outcomes. For example, in the HIV treatment field, outreach has long been used as a way to address barriers to HIV care. However, beyond the HIV care context, less is known about the potential role of accessible, culturally safe outreach delivered by PHC clinics to improve overall health and well-being, and potentially prevent HIV transmission. Research Plan: This study will examine the effectiveness of an outreach intervention tailored to meet the needs of women who are most affected by social inequities and violence. The outreach intervention will include peer support workers and nurses utilizing street outreach, mobile phone and online tools to meet the needs of a variety of women. Methods: Using a mixed methods design, qualitative and quantitative interviews will be conducted with a sample of 40-50 women to study the effectiveness of the outreach intervention. Interviews will focus on quality of life, engagement in care and symptoms of chronic pain, depression and trauma. Staff interviews will focus on strategies for optimizing best practices in outreach services.  Significance: This innovative approach of embedding outreach in PHC clinics to address barriers to health care will ultimately inform strategies for improving health equity, including HIV prevention, for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal women in Canada."

Our Program of Research covers nine cross-cutting themes that are of key relevance for Aboriginal boys and men in Canada including: 1) poverty and food security; 2) access to health services; 3) intergenerational trauma and healing; 4) intergenerational engagement in program and policy development; 5) compatibility and integration of Aboriginal and Western conceptions of health; 6) addictions; 7) structural violence, as exemplified in child welfare institutions; 8) integration of masculine and Aboriginal identities;  and 9) resilience. A tenth theme involves ethics applied with urban Aboriginal populations."
Improving hospital care for patients with severe addiction,"['Ti, Lianping (Mint)']",['N/A'],"['Addiction', 'Canada', 'Community-Based', 'Discharge Against Medical Advice', 'Injection Drug Users']",105000.0,307754,"Leaving a hospital against medical advice (AMA) is a growing public health challenge in North America, particularly among people who inject drugs (IDU). Of concern is the fact that discharge AMA has been linked to significant healthcare costs and individual-level harms, including readmission with a more serious form of an initial illness and mortality. Given that little is known about the circumstances that influence discharge AMA among IDU, the proposed research will seek to investigate individual and contextual factors that are associated with elevated risk of discharge AMA among IDU in Vancouver, Canada. Furthermore, this research will explore potential novel, low-threshold approaches to delivering care to IDU and thereby minimizing discharge AMA among this population. Specifically, the proposed research will evaluate an existing low-threshold community-based program that provides medical care and support for IDU who require long-term intravenous (IV) antibiotic treatment, the Community Transitional Care Team, and its impact on IV antibiotic treatment completion and hospital readmission rates. Additionally, a needs assessment of a supervised drug consumption facility operating within a hospital setting will be conducted as a potential intervention for reducing discharge AMA among this population. Data for this research will be collected from IDU residing in the Greater Vancouver area, and will be augmented by external hospital and public health databases. Given the lack of available evidence on discharge AMA among IDU, findings from this research will aim to provide critical knowledge needed for developing and implementing relevant policies and programs that aim to improve the health of this population."

Impact of early life fluoride exposure on neurodevelopmental outcomes among children in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort,"['Till, Christine']","['Flora, David B', 'Lanphear, Bruce P', 'Martinez Mier, E. Angeles']","['Biomarkers', ""Children'S Health"", 'Diet', 'Epidemiology', 'Fluoridation', 'Fluoride', 'Infancy', 'Neurotoxicology', 'Public Health', 'Water']",470475.0,444930,"The benefits and risks of fluoride exposure have been debated for decades. The Centers for Disease Control hails water fluoridation as one of the greatest public health achievements while others argue that fluoride exposure causes adverse health effects. While it is undisputed that fluoride is toxic at high levels (e.g. >5 mg/L), studies examining neurodevelopmental outcomes in populations exposed to optimal levels of fluoride are disputed. Existing human studies are limited in their ability to examine dose-response relations due to the restricted range of fluoride typically found in areas with fluoridation. Only a few studies have measured biomarkers of fluoride exposure across critical periods of development. Moreover, given the widespread sources of fluoride, few studies have directly linked sources of exposure when studying fluoride neurotoxicity. This study capitalizes on the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (NHBCS), a large, prospective cohort designed to examine how contaminants in drinking water and food affect the health of pregnant women and their children. We will leverage existing data from this cohort to assess the association between early-life exposure to fluoride (pregnancy and infancy) and children's IQ and behavioral problems in 578 mother-child pairs. Novel to our work is the measurement of fluoride in biospecimens (urine samples and toenails) as well as in tap water samples that are known to vary in fluoride concentration from approximately 0.1 to 2.0 mg/L. We will use detailed dietary intake information to understand sources of fluoride exposure in pregnant women and their infants. Finally, we will determine whether there is an increased risk of lower IQ scores or behavioral difficulties in children resulting from the use of fluoridated water to reconstitute infant formula. Results of this study will directly impact decision making on the safety of fluoride exposure during early brain development at levels relevant to the U.S. and Canada."
investigating the validity and reliability of accelerometer-based measures of PhysicaL Activity and sedentarY time in toddlers (iPLAY),"['Timmons, Brian W']","['Cairney, John', 'Obeid, Joyce', 'Tucker, Patricia']","['Accelerometry', 'Measurement', 'Physical Activity', 'Toddlers']",206550.0,356407,"Early childhood is a critical period to set the stage for healthy development. So it's a big problem that the World Health Organization estimates that in 2014, 41 million children under the age of 5 years were overweight or obese throughout the world. Obesity during the early years may cause major problems for our health care system as children grow up. In an effort to combat childhood obesity, our research group has helped make physical activity and sedentary behaviour guidelines for the early years. These guidelines prompted researchers to spend more time studying physical activity and sedentary time in very young children using special activity monitors called accelerometers. The problem is that we still don't know very much about physical activity and sedentary time in toddlers (1-2 years), because we haven't yet figured out how best to use accelerometers in these kids. Toddlers are still learning to walk, run, and play and this makes it harder for our activity monitors to measure their activity. The goal of this study is to learn more about the best ways to measure physical activity and sedentary time using our activity monitors. To do this, we will have 220 toddlers wear an activity monitor around their waist while they are in childcare. We will videotape them on two separate days while sitting, walking, running, and playing to better understand how the activity monitor detects their movement. We will also have them wear the activity monitor at home for 1 week to learn more about how active they are outside of daycare. This will be the first study to look at the best way to measure activity in toddlers using accelerometers. Once we know how best to measure physical activity and sedentary time in toddlers then we can start understanding how being active is linked to being healthy in very young children."
Enhancing Public Health Through a Comparative Analysis of Drug Supply Data: Revealing the Impact of the Unregulated Drug Supply on Canadians' Health,"['Tobias, Samuel H']",['N/A'],"['Addiction Medicine', 'Epidemiology', 'Harm Reduction', 'Health Administrative Data', 'Substance Use']",105000.0,497209,"The number of lives lost to the overdose public health emergency continues to rise with each passing day. In the province hit hardest by the crisis, British Columbia, signs of a reprieve were appearing through 2019, but COVID-19 exacerbated the crisis by disrupting both people's lives and the drug supply. Canada is contending with a drug supply saturated with potent fentanyl analogues and new substances which carry unique risks and harms. Novel public health responses have been introduced to abate this preventable loss of life, such as drug checking, a harm reduction approach which allows people who use drugs to have their substances chemically identified prior to use. Drug checking allows both service users to make informed decisions about their wellbeing and service providers an opportunity to speak directly with people to gather important contextual information about the samples being analyzed. The rapidly accessible drug supply data generated by drug checking can inform public health decision-makers more quickly than other sources of information, such as toxicology or police seizure analysis results. However, these other sources of data offer key elements that drug checking results lack, such as results from gold-standard technologies. While it is known that toxic drugs increase people's risk of overdose, not much is known about other health impacts rooted in the unregulated drug supply. This study aims to characterize trends in the drug supply by examining associations between different sources of drug supply data. Then, we will examine the downstream effects of disruptions (such as COVID-19) or policy interventions like decriminalization. Finally, using health administrative data, we will assess the impact of the drug supply on people's health. With the knowledge of what makes up the rapidly changing drug supply, and the specific harms associated with these changes, decision-makers can implement targeted and timely public health interventions to save lives."
Support and use of protected bicycle facilities: Baseline results from INTERACT Victoria.,"['Tobin, Melissa A']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,400501,"Health is important to Canadians. Most Canadians do not meet physical activity guidelines. Improving physical activity can improve mental and physical health. Increasing physical activity by a small amount per day has the biggest health impact. Our research focuses on how protected bike lanes effect physical activity. Protected bike lanes are separated from traffic by a curb. The goal is for everybody to feel safe riding their bike and being active. Our research is interested in how protected bike lanes influence active transportation levels. Active transportation occurs when you walk or bike from place to place. We believe that people who travel on protected bike lanes more often will have higher levels of physical activity. To answer our research question, participants completed an online survey and wore a device to measure their location and physical activity for 10 days. We are studying the Pandora protected bike lane in the All Ages and Abilities Cycling Network in Victoria, British Columbia. Half of the participants were female and their average age was 45 years old. The results show that 87% of participants think the AAA is a very good idea. 79% of participants will cycle more once it is complete. 68% of participants would feel very comfortable on protected bike lanes. Only 17% would feel comfortable on a busy street without a protected bike lane. Initial results show that the AAA Network may encourage cycling in Victoria. The presentation will include results from the GPS and physical activity data. This research is important for all Canadians because bike lanes make it easier for people to be active. The results from this study have the potential to influence other bike lane projects across the country."

Although there are medications for short-term treatment of insomnia the majority of pregnant women say that they will not take them because of fears about the potential impact on the developing baby - this leaves pregnant women without alternative treatments for insomnia. Our research group has developed a psychological intervention called ""Sleeping for Two: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) experienced during pregnancy"". The intervention is a six-week psychological therapy that helps pregnant women improve behaviours and thoughts related to sleep. Initial results show that the therapy improves symptoms of insomnia during pregnancy. This proposed project is a larger trial of the Sleeping for Two intervention. The main goals of the project are to investigate if the Sleeping for Two intervention, compared to regular care in pregnancy, reduces symptoms of insomnia in pregnancy and if those gains are maintained at 6-months postpartum. Additional goals are to test if CBT-I reduces symptoms of depression, anxiety and improves infant sleep. We plan to recruit pregnant women with insomnia and assign them to receive either six sessions of in-person CBT-I or to receive regular obstetrical care. We will ask participants to complete an assessment at baseline, seven weeks later and then again when they are six months postpartum. We predict that the CBT-I intervention will reduce symptoms of insomnia and improve other important outcomes, including lowering symptoms of depression, anxiety and improving infant sleep."

We are interested in the factors that cause modifiable differences (inequities) in sleep health. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) has produced a set of guidelines for analyzing quantitative health data from an intersectional point of view. Intersectionality refers to the ways in which different aspects of a person's identity, such as ethnicity/race, gender, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status (SES), geographic location, and others, interact to shape not only their experiences but also their access to resources, opportunities, and social power. The CIHR Sleep Consortium was formed to generate new knowledge about sleep health that will inform clinical practice and support public health initiatives to deliver resources where they are most needed. Current funded research themes within the Consortium include sleep and mental health, and sleep across the life cycle. As a part of the Sleep Consortium, we will apply the PHAC guidelines to a series of existing datasets that have tracked sleep habits and behaviours in various Canadian populations over time in different ways. Doing this work properly requires consulting with diverse people with lived experiences of sleep troubles. It also requires appropriate research with Indigenous communities by Indigenous researchers. This funding will make it possible for us to engage directly with diverse members of the public, including Indigenous communities, to find out what healthy sleep looks like to them. This knowledge will teach us about intersectionality as it relates to sleep research and public health interventions. We will apply that knowledge to our sleep datasets, and share what we learn with other researchers in the Consortium and with public health agencies, to assist with public health efforts such as measuring sleep health and habits or developing policies related to childcare."

We will use a large population-based cohort of 1.9 million subjects receiving care in a universal health care system to compare the rates of change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and proteinuria among elderly statin-users, as compared with non-users or users of other lipid-modifying medications such as fibrates or ezetimibe. We will also ascertain the risk of certain major adverse events (rhabdomyolysis, incident acute kidney injury, major cardiovascular events) associated with statin use in the population, as compared with non-users or users of other lipid-modifying medications. A major focus of the work will be to compare different statins with each other, as well as to search for a dose effect of statins on the outcomes of interest.

It is clear that multimorbidity is common and is associated with worse clinical outcomes and higher health care costs, compared to good health or to the presence of a single chronic condition. However, there are major knowledge gaps about how common multimorbidity is in Canada today, and about which individual conditions make the most important contributions to the overall health and economic burden of multimorbidity. Doctors and policy-makers need this information to help design health systems that effectively deal with the epidemic of chronic disease generally and multimorbidity specifically. 

The current proposal describes a novel collaboration between health services researchers, primary care physicians, and policy-makers responsible for Alberta's chronic disease programs. We will use a unique database of all 4 million adults insured by the Alberta provincial health ministry between 1997 and 2011. We will identify people with multimorbidity (2 or more of chronic conditions) and measure certain health outcomes and health expenditures for people with and without multimorbidity. We will also measure how common multimorbidity is overall, and how rapidly the number of people with multimorbidity is increasing.

We have a strong research team, and are experienced with using these data. To ensure that our research is most useful to decision-makers, we have designed the study together with help from national and provincial policymakers were responsible for the care of people with chronic diseases. We believe that our findings will be useful to all people who are responsible for the care of people with chronic disease. The findings will also help researchers to develop future studies that improve the care of people with multimorbidity."

Mobility is the physical ability of humans to work or move themselves within their communities. As mobility promotes independence of older adults, is also essential to understand how the built environment (BE) influences their health, mobility and wellbeing. The built environment is the combination of individual elements of towns and cities where people work, live and play (e.g. land use, density and connectivity on the macro-scale and sidewalks, benches and lighting on the micro-scale). Older Canadians are more ethnically diverse than the general population, and immigrants comprise 28% of the seniors population. Recent international literature suggests that some foreign-born older adults are at a higher risk for limited mobility. My study seeks to: 1) describe how foreign-born status and the BE influence the mobility of urban dwelling older adults and, 2) develop, implement and evaluate a program (e.g. walking or bus buddy group) that supports the mobility of foreign-born older adults, in partnership with South Vancouver Neighbourhood House. My study consists of 3 parts: i) analysis of data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), ii) interviews with foreign-born older adults and iii) an evaluation of a community-based mobility intervention.
