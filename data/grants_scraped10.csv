The Strongest Families™ Parenting Program:  A randomized-controlled trial of a culturally appropriate parenting program for northwestern Ontario First Nations communities,"['Toombs, Elaine C']",['N/A'],"['Child Mental Health', 'First Nations Health', 'Indigenous Health Research', 'Parent Intervention', 'Parenting', 'Randomized Controlled Trial']",105000.0,383406,"The Truth and Reconciliation Report (2015) has documented the need for culturally relevant parenting programs within First Nations communities. First Nations families have requested parenting supports that meet their unique challenges, often within remote and rural communities. Strongest Families™ is a twelve week web-based parenting intervention that is administered with telephone support by a paraprofessional coach. This program has been modified by a First Nations research advisory group to better meet the needs of First Nations families. To determine if this program is an effective solution for First Nations communities, we will assess both how feasible and useful it is for families, by interviewing the first 15 families that complete the intervention and asking about their experiences with the program.  We will also evaluate how effective the intervention is by randomly assigning 185 participants to either complete the intervention or to have access to other parenting resources.  By comparing the outcomes of those that complete and do not complete the intervention, we hope to evaluate how effective the program is at reducing child behavioural concerns and parent distress.  Results of this study will be used to promote the continuation of Strongest Families, and to improve parent and child mental health outcomes using a First Nations model of parenting."

Antimicrobial Resistance Manure Intervention Strategies,"['Topp, Edward', 'Boerlin, Patrick']",['N/A'],['Mitigation Of Amr'],597599.0,367925,"Livestock animals consume the majority of antibiotics globally. These antibiotics and their active degradation products together with antibiotic resistant bacteria are partially excreted into the environment via manure. Manure is one of the major sources of bacteria resistant to antibiotics in the environment, and, as exemplified by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), it may significantly contribute to their spread in food, water and air, with subsequent exposure of humans. To date, no study has investigated the reduction of antimicrobial resistance (antibiotics, bacteria and genes) by different manure treatments, such as anaerobic digestion and aerobic composting.
In this study, we will measure the effectiveness of different manure treatment procedures on antimicrobial resistance reduction throughout the manure processing chain and assess relevant parameters in this reduction. We will focus on major bacteria, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE), MRSA, and the corresponding antibiotic resistance genes and residues in large-scale (centralised) treatment as well as small-scale (farm) systems, in different national contexts and varying resistance prevalence. Culture-dependent and culture-independent methods and metagenomic studies will be used to evaluate the abundance of selected antibiotic-resistant bacteria and their concomitant resistance genes (and mobility) at different steps of the manure treatment process. Risk assessment studies will be conducted and outcomes will be communicated to improve risk awareness, to guide intervention prioritization and to improve understanding of exposure risks. Knowledge on the effects of manure processing on antibiotic resistance transmission may contribute to a reduction of the impact of the livestock industry on antibiotic resistance."
Intervention of antimicrobial resistance transfer into the food chain,"['Topp, Edward']",['N/A'],['Mitigation Of Amr In Animal Manures'],232972.0,367926,"Soil and water have been identified as reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the food chain as the most likely mode of AMR transfer into human and animal pathogens. Manure is reused as soil fertiliser in which food plants grow and is a source of AMR. We hypothesise that pre-treatment of manure will reduce and remove the abundance and diversity of AMR genes and pathogenic bacteria of high priority from entering the food chain. Alleviating AMR elements from entering the food chain will reduce the transfer and uptake of mobile AMR genes and pathogens by human and animal bacteria. This project will focus on chicken and pig manure as both have been demonstrated to carry a wide variety and abundance of mobile AMR genes of clinical relevance. Our intervention is to pre-treat the manure in order to reduce or remove the burden of AMR in the manure prior to reuse as fertiliser. The microbiomes of chicken and pig manure differ, but the AMR genes and mobile elements overlap. Our study will investigate if the same pre- treatments will reduce or remove AMR prior to application and if these reductions or removal are maintained on the food plants or grass, and in the soil. Reducing or removing the threat of AMR at the start of the food chain will reduce the potential for selection and transfer of such AMR genes and pathogens further along the food chain. By stopping or reducing the continuous transfer of AMR genes and mobile elements along the food chain we will reduce the burden of AMR in pathogenic bacteria."
Building a Clinical Prediction Rule to Detect Respiratory Morbidity in Young Children and a Population Monitoring Rule to Measure Respiratory Health Services Use and Health Outcomes.,"['To, Teresa']","['Abdullah, Kawsari', 'Gershon, Andrea S', 'Lou, Wen-Yi W', 'Subbarao, Padmaja']","['Asthma', 'Case Validation', 'Disease Burden And Management', 'Early Detection', 'Health Services Utilization', 'Population Surveillance', 'Pre-School Children', 'Prediction Rule']",75000.0,363431,"In Canada, lung diseases cause more hospitalizations among preschoolers than any other disease and are expensive to look after. Even though many chronic lung diseases like asthma seem to begin at a young age, they usually are not diagnosed until a few years later. Because of this delay, lung diseases may go untreated in young children, and this could lead to worse health. We believe that the delay in diagnosis happens because lung tests in young children are not being used in the best way possible to predict which children will have lung diseases. Our team will link a birth cohort with population databases (health administrative data and environmental exposures data) to 1) develop tools to predict lung diseases in young children and 2) monitor the health of young children in Ontario who might have lung diseases. The birth cohort data come from the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study-a study that has collected a lot of health, lifestyle and other information since the children were babies, including state-of-the-art lung tests from infancy to preschool age. The health administrative data are provided by the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES), and they will show us how many times children in Ontario saw a doctor or went to the emergency room or hospital for breathing problems. Finally, the environmental exposures data from the Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change will show us how clean or dirty the air around children's houses is may affect their lung health. When our prediction and monitoring tools are used in the at-risk population of young children, it may be possible to predict lung diseases earlier in young children, and even to stop these diseases from worsening. Lung diseases are a significant health problem in Canada, leading to many emergency room visits and hospital stays. Therefore, catching these diseases early will improve children's lung health and lessen the burden on the Canadian health care system."
Vaping and asthma - A study on short and long-term health effects of vaping among Ontario youths and young adults with asthma identified in health administrative data and linked to the Canadian Community Health Survey,"['To, Teresa', 'Van Dam, Anne']","['MacKinnon, Jennifer', 'Borkhoff, Cornelia M', 'Chow, Chung-Wai', 'Moraes, Theo', 'Schwartz, Robert M', 'Vozoris, Nicholas']","['Asthma And Vaping', 'Health Services Use And Vaping', 'Short And Long-Term Health Effects', 'Vaping And Asthma-Related Comorbidities', 'Vaping And Physical Activity', 'Vaping And Physical, Social And Well-Bing', 'Vaping And Quality Of Life', 'Vaping In Youth And Young Adults']",100000.0,426071,"While it is generally thought that e-cigarette (EC) is a safer alternative to smoking, new research suggests that vaping may worsen pre-existing health conditions and have long-term health effects. Our proposed study will examine the long-term health risks and outcomes among young EC users, by comparing their health outcomes and health trajectories between EC users and non-users. We will conduct 3 studies using 2 Canadian surveys (Canadian Community Health Survey, CCHS: 2015-17 and Canadian Health Measures Survey, CHMS: 2016-2019) and 6 health administrative databases. The CCHS is a cross-sectional survey that collects information through questionnaires about health status, health determinants and behaviours. Linkage of the CCHS with health administrative data will allow us to measure the health outcomes of the study population for the period of 2010 to 2020. The CHMS is a cross-sectional survey that collects health information including physical activity, quality of life, heart rate and blood pressure, blood sugar and lipid profiles through questionnaires and direct measurements. The 3 studies to be conducted aim to answer the following research questions: 1) Do youth and young adults who are current EC users have increased risks of asthma and/or other allergic diseases? 2) Do youth and young adults who are current EC users and have asthma and/or other allergic diseases have more morbidity as measured by health services use for asthma, allergic disease, and related conditions? 3) Are youth and young adults who are EC users and have asthma and/or other allergic diseases less physically active, have poorer physical, mental and social well-being and quality of life? With a significant number of young Canadians reporting EC vaping, it is imperative to examine data on the health effects of vaping. Our population-based research findings will provide the data needed to guide policy and educate young people to make informed decisions to protect overall health."
"FActors of Mothers and Infants in Longitudinal Years (FAMILY) - A maternal and child birth cohort with babies identified from three Ontario existing pediatric cohorts and linked with health administrative data to create a birth cohort of infants and their siblings and mothers to study prenatal, postnatal and early childhood factors associated with maternal and child health and developmental outcomes","['To, Teresa', 'Borkhoff, Cornelia M']","['Guttman, Beverly', 'Van Dam, Anne', 'Anderson, Laura N', 'Birken, Catherine S', 'Dell, Sharon D', 'Janus, Magdalena', 'Maguire, Jonathon L', 'Moraes, Theo', 'Parkin, Patricia', 'Subbarao, Padmaja']","['Birth Cohort', 'Childhood Health Surveillace', 'Common Childhood Respiratory Conditions', 'Early Life Exposures', 'Early Screening And Detection', 'Maternal And Child Health', 'Risk Identification']",2338.0,421827,"Considering the high health burden of asthma in children, the high incidence of asthma exacerbation during pregnancy, and the significant economic burden of poorly controlled asthma, it is crucial to characterise asthma phenotypes and to examine the impacts of this condition on children and mothers. Our team will combine 3 Ontario pediatric cohorts to create a large longitudinal birth cohort, and will use linked population databases to efficiently identify children, their siblings, and mothers. The birth cohort data will come from three existing studies: the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study, the Toronto Child Health Evaluation Questionnaire (T-CHEQ) Study, and the Applied Research Group for Kids (TARGet Kids!) Study. The children who participated in these studies, their siblings and their mothers will be identified in administrative data housed at ICES. The resulting FAMILY cohort will consist of a birth cohort of 28,000 children (cohort study participants and siblings) and a maternal cohort of the 12,000 mothers of these children. The FAMILY birth cohort will have demographic, clinical, biomarker and health services utilization data, as well as social and environmental data from the Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research Consortium (CANUE) and the Early Development Instrument (EDI). Using the longitudinal cohort, we will conduct 2 studies to: 1) use early life exposures from birth to 3 years (e.g. air pollution) to predict later childhood health and developmental outcomes (e.g. asthma incidence); and 2) determine whether maternal medical history (e.g. asthma attack during pregnancy) is associated with maternal delivery and infant birth outcomes (e.g. low birth weight). Our proposed study will build a large cohort of children and mothers and use big (administrative) and deep (survey and clinical) data to evaluate longitudinal health and developmental outcomes and investigate questions that were not possible to address before."
Supporting the Alberta Métis Settlements in advancing their Chronic Disease Prevention Model: Sharing results from administered ACE questionnaire in the Settlements,"['Toth, Ellen L']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal', 'Chronic Disease Prevention', 'Community Infrastructure', 'Dissemination Meeting', 'Mental Health', 'Metis']",14000.0,246065,"Since 2003, the Mobile Diabetes Screening Initiative (MDSi) - sponsored under Alberta's Diabetes Strategy 2003-2013 - has collaborated with Alberta's Métis Settlements to deliver diabetes and chronic disease screening and prevention. Though MDSi's in-community service delivery mediates some barriers to care access (ex. distance), the 2009 project evaluation revealed community members desire MDSi take on a more holistic Aboriginal health approach.  
In response, MDSi engaged the Settlements and the Métis Settlements General Council (MSGC) in discussions to determine their vision for an Aboriginal health model for chronic disease prevention. Common themes expressed were: 1.) advancing prevention by addressing mental health risks underlying chronic disease; and 2.) need for community control over health and health resources. Discussions culminated in a MSGC resolution establishing a Métis Settlements Health Board. 
MDSi proposed the ACE (Adverse Childhood Events) questionnaire as a tool for data gathering and identifying community members at risk for mental health factors that may heighten risk for chronic disease. ACE data would provide the Settlements with information for setting evidence-based health policies and priorities, negotiating programming and resources, etc.
MDSi will tentatively pilot the ACE questionnaire in the Settlements from Nov 2011-Apr 2012. We are requesting funding from CIHR to support MDSi in hosting a dissemination meeting (tentative date: Apr 20, 2012) to report the ACE pilot results to the Settlements. Representatives from Alberta Health and Wellness and Alberta Health Services will also be invited to attend. The meeting will include a guest speaker presentation on long-term health effects of unresolved trauma. Objectives for this meeting are to advance a means for MDSi supporting the Settlements' vision for chronic disease prevention, and for MDSi incorporating a more holistic Aboriginal health approach to its scope and service delivery."
Sleep is not just a matter of night: Understanding the etiology of naps in 2.5- to 6-year-olds,"['Touchette, Evelyne', 'Pennestri, Marie-Hélène']","['Boivin, Michel', 'Côté, Sylvana', 'Montplaisir, Jacques Y', 'Reid, Graham J', 'Tremblay, Richard E']","['Developemental Milestones', 'Etiology', 'Longitudinal Study', 'Naps', 'Pediatric Sleep', 'Preschoolers']",73950.0,491330,"A recent meta-analysis has described children naps patterns and highlighted important recommendations to address: a) to inform napping cessation prevalence rates and b) to better understand the role of napping in meeting children's 24h sleep need. Sleep is not only a matter of nocturnal sleep and major changes are observed from birth up to school entry. Naps have been shown to be beneficial for learning and emotion regulation, which are key ingredients for academic success. Other studies have shown that napping can have a negative impact on sleep consolidation, by shortening the duration of sleep at night. Specialists from early childhood centers do not know when naps should be stopped and would like to be guided by clear recommendations according to age groups. The present project has two objectives: (1) To document daytime sleep in infants and young children at each age including 5 months, 1.5 and 2.5 years of age and (2) To identify factors associated with nap cessation in preschoolers aged 2.5 to 6 years old. The project will use the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development I (1997/1998 -, n=2120) and II (2000 -, n= 4 700) two representative samples of children. Daytime sleep duration was assessed in children aged of 5 months of age to 6 years to mothers. This project will lead to clear recommendations to inform parents and specialists in childcare structures by establishing reference points of individual variations in patterns of naps to distinguish typically from atypical sleep development that may warrant investigation and/or intervention."

While MS was long considered a disease primarily of Caucasians of northern and central European ancestry, it is now being increasingly recognized in immigrants from low risk to high risk regions. 15% of the population of British Columbia is Chinese descent (Canadian Asians), and with over 500,000 individuals, we can look at rates of MS in this important population. This will give us an opportunity to study environmental differences between China and Canada, and potential genetic factors that can influence the overall risk of MS. The knowledge gained from this study could help us to better understand the possible causes of complex autoimmune diseases.  Neurologists at our MS center have reported that Canadian Asians often have a worse prognosis compared to the general population. It will be important to try and identify genetic factors that can predict future disability. This could guide doctors to choosing the best therapy as early as possible for all patients with MS in Canada and in China. This is the first systematic characterization of MS in patients with at least 50% Chinese ancestry in Canada. What we learn from this study, we can apply to other ethnic groups in Canada to better understand how to better treat MS within our diverse country."
FGF10 haploinsufficiency is associated with smaller airways lumen: implications for COPD susceptibility,"['Traboulsi, Hussein']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,382867,"Introduction: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death. Despite a 50% decline in cigarette smoking over the past 5 decades, the burden of COPD has not decreased. These observations suggest that identification of risk factors, beyond smoking, that contribute to COPD are needed. We recently demonstrated- by standard computed tomography (CT Scan)- that two variations in the airways tree that occur in one quarter of a large population. These airway branch variants were associated with up to two-fold higher odds of prevalent COPD, and there was a genetic association between one of these variations with mutations in a gene encoding for a protein named fibroblast growth factor 10 (Fgf10). Fgf10 is required for the development of many branched organs, including the lungs, but the role of FGF10 in COPD is not completely known.
Hypothesis: Fgf10 reduction or mutations is associated with smaller airway lumens, a feature that increase susceptibility to the development of COPD.
Methods: Mice that express less Fgf10 (named Fgf10+/-) were obtained from UCSF (Dr. Ophir klein). Airway structure was assessed using micro-CT (for animals). Lung functions (resistance of airways, resistance and elastance of lung) were measured using machine named Flexivent (SCIREQ, Montréal). 
Results: Fgf10+/- mice have narrowed airways comparing with the control mice. Moreover, we showed that Fgf10+/- mice has more airway resistance.
Conclusion: We demonstrated that reduction in the amount of Fgf10 exhibit the similar COPD structure-function phenotype that we previously observed in 2 cohorts (ie. narrowed airways). Variations in airway anatomy, due to genetic factors, could be thus a COPD risk factor and easily identifiable by CT scan."
Economic evaluation of a school-based program for the prevention of obesity in Canada,"['Tran, Bach X']",['N/A'],"['Chronic Conditions', 'Cost-Effectiveness', 'Economic Evaluation', 'Economic Modeling', 'Health-Related Quality Of Life', 'Longitudinal Study', 'Obesity Prevention', 'Population Health', 'Return-On-Investment', 'School Health']",135000.0,270015,"Our previous research has identified the Health Promoting Schools Program (HPSP) as very effective in promoting healthy eating and active living and preventing childhood obesity. While better health behaviors and improved health status are important to public health decision makers, cost-effectiveness and return-on-investment are also important. However, economic evaluations of these programs have yielded mixed results and there is no Canadian data available yet.

We propose to conduct an economic evaluation of the HPSP by comparing its program costs with changes in proportions of obesity, health care costs, and quality of life of the Canadian population. We will develop a mathematical model to represent the lifetime progression of school children over five obesity-related health states, including: underweight, normal, overweight, obesity and death. Existing data from Statistics Canada's surveys, the assessments of the HPSP in Nova Scotia and Alberta, and from Medline and Cochrane searches will be used to parameterise the model. The model will project the trends of obesity epidemics in Canada and assess the long-term impacts of the HPSP on future disease burden. The outcome measures include program and health care costs, proportions of obesity and chronic conditions avoided, savings in medical expenditures and absenteeism costs, and quality-adjusted life years gained by the intervention. 

Findings of this study will inform resource allocation and justify investments in school-based health promotion. Moreover, effective school-based program in preventing childhood obesity that will also save future health care costs may become a key strategy in curbing the obesity epidemic in Canada."
Forget me not: a calvacade of commitment for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias,"['Tran, Chau', 'Sadavoy, Joel']","['Dudgeon, Scott', 'Greenwood, Carol E', 'Mihailidis, Alex', 'Mittelman, Mary S', 'Schulz, Mary E']","[""Alzheimer'S Disease""]",3000.0,236743,"Alzheimer's disease and related dementias is a malady which requires attention because of the increasing incidence in conjunction with the preponderance of an aging society.  According to the seminal report, the Rising Tide, the incidence of Alzheimer's disease and related dementias in Canada has been identified as 1 case being diagnosed every five minutes.  Most recent estimates indicate that 480,600 Canadians have dementia (i.e., 1.5% of the population).  Future projections suggest that this figure will rise to 1,125,200 Canadians with dementia in the year 2038.  The time cost of informal care provided annually to persons with dementia has been estimated as 231 million hours.  Not to be neglected are the economic consequences of dementia particularly to families who incur out of pocket expenses and physical fatigue from the challenges of caregiving.   On a positive note, there have been concerted efforts to devise solutions to the challenges which Alzheimer's disease and related dementias pose to health care practitioners, health policy decision makers, researchers, families and the patients.  The relationship between nutritional diet and Alzheimer's disease suggests that fast foods may be a contributing factor to the onset of this disease.  Engineers have been concocting novel technologies ranging from testing a winter coat to voice applications for dementia patients with speech difficulties.  The transcultural influences and social consequences have demonstrated the impact of this malady.  Caregiving can bear its emotional toll on families; however, the enhanced understanding of this disease lead to a wealth of teaching tools on coping mechanisms from geriatric psychiatrists.  The support of non-profit organizations, such as the Alzheimer Society of Canada, assist the families and persons affected by this disease."
Vitamin D and related biomarkers as predictors of severe influenza infection in children,"['Tran, Dat']","[""O'Connor, Deborah L"", 'Thorpe, Kevin E', 'Vieth, Reinhold']","['Biomarker', 'Disease Severity', 'Human Cathelicidin', 'Human Defensins', 'Influenza', 'Vitamin D']",135210.0,323503,"Influenza infection leads to hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide annually, where many of these deaths are in young children. While some children infected with the influenza virus show symptoms similar to a common cold, others develop high fevers and may experience dangerous complications leading to organ damage and death. Interestingly, influenza can pose a threat to all children, regardless of whether they are otherwise healthy or not.

Genetic, viral and environmental factors may be at the root of varying severity of flu in children. At a nutritional level, nutrients such as vitamin D have been shown to be highly involved in lung health. It is thought that vitamin D may regulate the production of protective compounds in the lining of the respiratory system. Our team plans to determine if blood levels of vitamin D and these protective compounds have an impact on flu severity.

Our proposed project is associated with a large, Canadian study (called ""FluGene"") where patient recruitment has been ongoing since the 2007/2008 flu season. Influenza symptom severity will be measured using a scale index that is determined by reviewing questionnaire data collected during the study and patient health records. We will then examine the results to see if there is a relationship between the levels of vitamin D and related protective compounds in the blood of the flu-positive children and how severe their flu symptoms are.

Influenza infection is a recurring seasonal threat to children. Therefore, understanding the factors that make children vulnerable to a more severe level of infection is important, as it may inform changes in health care. It is known that vitamin D status is possible to correct, and deficiencies are easily and safely improved in children. This study would contribute to our understanding of pediatric health and would support future studies geared towards decreasing influenza-related deaths in Canada and worldwide."

The face of heart disease is changing such that young adults are entering adulthood with a number of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and older adults have lived longer with their unhealthy habits and are developing heart disease at an earlier age.  A recent Heart and Stroke Foundation report identified adult women as a population at risk.  Given that adults spend a significant amount of time in the workplace, the potential influence of the work environment on CVD risk requires careful examination.  In this study we are focusing on one aspect of the work environment (shift work) and an identified at risk population (adult females) as approximately 28% of employed women have worked at some time in a shift work pattern, and this proportion of female shift workers is the highest among hospital workers.  Current studies, predominantly completed among male workers, suggest that individuals working night shift may be at increased CVD risk; however, the mechanisms linking shift work and CVD risk are unclear. The purpose of this study is to empirically test a mechanistic model that postulates that shift work is associated with increased CVD risk through its influences on 3 different but interactive physiological, behavioural and social pathways.   We will conduct an observational study and recruit 300 female hospital employees who have been in the workforce for at least 10 years. Information will be obtained through clinical assessment, biochemical measures, continuous actigraphy and self-report.  Our analysis plan is designed to elucidate the different hypothesized pathways linking shift work to CVD risk in working women.  The findings from this study will contribute novel findings to our understanding of the harmful and protective characteristics of shift work, and will inform the development of healthy workplace policies."
The first episode psychosis movement: an ethnography of new hopes to untangle stigma and psychosis,"['Tranulis, Constantin']","['Park, Melissa M', 'Whitley, Rob', 'Zafran, Hiba']","['Ethnography', 'First Episode Psychosis', 'Narrative Studies', 'Psychosis', 'Schizophrenia', 'Stigma']",107760.0,212110,"Early intervention for persons with psychosis is an emerging field in psychiatry and a radical shift in conceptualizing and
treating psychosis. Early intervention in first episodes of psychosis rests on the premise that treating early and using best
practices will improve the prognosis of psychosis. This is an ambitious goal, as past advances in bio-psycho-social research
of psychosis failed to materialize into durable and significant improvements for the persons suffering from psychosis.
Stigma, which is a deeply discrediting narrative about the person experiencing psychosis, can explain why overall real-life
prognosis of psychosis might not have improved in spite of all the advances of biomedical sciences.
We need to know what is at stake when the diagnosis of psychosis is given earlier and aggressive treatment is offered. The
experience of stigma can be deeply changed, with both positive effects (for example dissipating pessimistic views on
schizophrenia) and negative pitfalls (such as increasing the capacity of being labeled as ""psychotic"" by lay persons following
public education campaigns).
We are a team of clinicians trained and engaged in the FEP movement who are motivated to reflect and critically upraise our
clinical practice in order to understand the deeper and broader implications of this shift in treatment paradigm on our
practices and on our patients. We are dually trained as clinicians and social scientists and we aim to use our dual expertise
in order to create a rigorous reflexive space in which to research the new manifestations of stigma in psychosis.
Given the success of the FEP movement and of the changes undertaken in its becoming a mainstream therapeutic
paradigm, one cannot overemphasize the importance of exploring stigma in this new context. Our analyses will have a final
goal in finding potential targets for interventions aimed at reducing stigma in psychosis"

The Canadian Public Health Association notes that poverty, homelessness, stigma, addiction, violence, untreated mental health problems, lack of employment opportunities, powerlessness, lack of choice, lack of legal status and lack of social support create environments in which HIV and other illnesses flourish and spread.  Very little Canadian health research has focussed on understanding the health issues and health care needs of two marginalized populations,  transgendered and transsexual individuals as well as lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youth.  Drawing on a social determinants of health framework, this five year program of research will focus on exploring the role that social exclusion plays in shaping health outcomes, and healthcare access barriers for gender and sexual minorities.  Given the dearth of information addressing the needs of these populations in the Canadian context, a significant emphasis of this research program will be on identifying factors that will 1. lead to improved health outcomes, 2. help to ameliorate service access barriers, and 3. help to overcome vulnerability by fostering personal resiliency.  The program of research will be community based and collaborative, involving a number of community agencies and service providers as partners.  In addition, this research program will include significant opportunities for student mentoring.

Most people experience mild or moderate illness but some experience severe illness requiring hospitalization or resulting in death. Cases without any symptoms (called asymptomatic) have also been reported but how frequently that occurs is hard to know because people with asymptomatic infections are less likely to be seen by a health care professional or to be tested for the virus. Children appear to be less affected overall by the pandemic, but some reports suggest they are more likely to have mild or asymptomatic infections so may also be missed. To get a better understanding of the extent to which mild or asymptomatic infections, including children, contribute to the overall burden and spread of COVID-2019, we propose a household study involving families with children in British Columbia (BC) and Quebec. When the first case in a household is identified, we will actively follow all of the household members for infection over a one-month period. We will measure how many become infected by testing them for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in their blood at the start and end of the one-month period and by asking them to self-collect respiratory specimens weekly. All household members will complete a daily diary of symptoms so we can compare their test results to their symptom severity, including whether they had been infected without even knowing it (asymptomatic). To study immune responses and viral shedding in more detail, we will also offer a subset of households to participate in more intensive sampling. These findings will clarify the role of asymptomatic infections and children and help public health authorities navigate the next stages of the pandemic."

Since the start of KSDPP, many studies have attempted to evaluate the effects of the project on diabetes and on the lifestyles of the targeted population. These evaluations have shown modest or no improvements on physical activity, diet, weight and diabetes. Changing behaviors leading to better health is a complex and long-term task that needs a variety of efforts directed not only at individuals, but also at their social and physical environments. For this reason, health promotion projects do not always translate directly into lifestyle and health improvements. Some researchers believe that health promotion projects targeting communities have to become social movements in order to properly succeed in changing people's behaviors. A social movement permeates a society's organizations, institutions, and policies (also named 'structures'), and conveys a particular message (also called the 'framing discourse') hinging on values to mobilize people. My hypothesis is that KSDPP has evolved into a community mobilizing movement, which is a first step in the path leading toward health improvement. During my project, I want to explore which kind of structures (organizations, institutions, policies) KSDPP has penetrated and what is the particular message that KSDPP uses to mobilize people. This study is important because it encourages reflection on health promotion effects in terms of community mobilization. Results will be helpful to the community by pinpointing structures, messages, arguments and values that could be used to further mobilize the actors and the community toward diabetes prevention.

My project, which has been conducted in full partnership with the community, aims to build on a social movement theory framework to explore and understand KSDPP's outcomes and processes at a community-level. Social movement theory examines the conditions under which collective action emerges and develops to promote social change around an issue.

A diet low in folate (a B vitamin) during early pregnancy may lead to birth defects of the brain and spinal cord. Folic acid is the man-made form of folate. Folic acid supplements of 0.4 milligrams per day are recommended for women of childbearing age in Canada. Women can also eat folate-rich foods, such as fortified grain products, to get enough folic acid. A higher dose folic acid supplement of 5 milligrams per day is recommended for women at risk for birth defects of the brain and spinal cord, for example, women who are obese or who have a family history of brain and spinal cord defects. Some health professionals argue that most women of childbearing age need higher doses of folic acid, even if they do not have risk factors. However, it is not yet known if these higher doses are necessary. Research is needed to look at the how much folate is in the blood of Canadian women, or their folate status, and their intake of folate-rich foods and supplements. 

For the first time, a national survey will include measurements of the folate status of Canadian women. Statistics Canada's Canadian Health Measures Survey (CHMS) collected health data from 5000 Canadians, aged 6 to 79 years, from March 2007 to February 2009. About 1000 of these were women of childbearing age. This research will look at the CHMS data to better understand the factors surrounding folate recommendations, and whether Canadian women are getting as much folate as they need. Canadian women's intake of folic acid supplements, health conditions and measures of red blood cell folate will be examined. CHMS data will be compared to similar American data. The results of this research will be used to update nutrition policies and better the health of women and children."

International surveillance study of compliance with Global 24-hour movement  guidelines in the early years,"['Tremblay, Mark S']","['Okely, Anthony D']","['Children', 'Global', 'Growth And Development', 'Health Equity', 'Physical Activity', 'Population Health', 'Sedentary Behaviour', 'Sleep']",20000.0,372769,"The Early Years (ages 0-4) is a critical period for developing physical, social and cognitive skills. Furthermore, it provides an opportunity to positively influence the health trajectory of a child's life and to reduce health inequalities. Typically, a toddler's movement behaviours will be a combination of sleep, sitting, standing, physical activity and play. Little is known how these movements influence one another and how they relate to healthy development, and this lack of knowledge is more apparent in low and middle income countries (LMICs).  
The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified preventing obesity in young children as one of its key priorities of the 21st Century; movement behaviours play a key role in achieving this. Currently there are no international movement-related guidelines for the early years, which is problematic for assigning benchmarks and estimating prevalence levels. Canada and Australia are each finalizing their country's respective 24-hour movement guidelines for the early years (targeting physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep), which will be co-released in November 2017 and will be the world's first of their type. Furthermore, the WHO has confirmed that they will respond with Global 24-hour movement guidelines in early 2018. Initial data collected from Canada and Australia show that <15% of toddlers meet all three of the movement guidelines: at least 180 minutes of physical activity, with 60 minutes of energetic play; no more than 1 hour of sedentary screen time; and 10-13 hours of quality sleep. Not meeting these guidelines increases the risk for poorer health and negative developmental outcomes. 
Therefore, this study will collect international surveillance data using the new global 24-hr movement guidelines as benchmarks, across countries with different Human Developmental Indexes, and aid the global community in preventing obesity. As a result, a planning meeting is necessary to coordinate this global effort."

Thus, international efforts have focused on ensuring optimal development at this age. Unfortunately, our understanding of child development is mainly informed by research from high-income countries and urban settings. Physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and sleep-collectively
termed movement behaviours-have shown potential to benefit children's development. Recognizing the importance of movement behaviours, our group developed Canadian 24-hour movement behaviour guidelines for early years children. While individual movement behaviours are beneficial for children's lifelong development, little is known about the ideal distribution of all movement behaviours in a 24-hour day. This lack of information is particularly pronounced in rural settings and low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).

This proposal seeks to examine associations between movement behaviours and development in urban and rural children in: Brazil, Canada, India, and Malawi.

Countries were selected to represent all World Bank income classifications (i.e., high:Canada, middle-high:Brazil, middle-low:India, and low-income:Malawi), different continents, and North-South hemispheres (i.e., North:Canada and India; South:Brazil and Malawi). Countries will each recruit 1,000 children aged 3-4 years, balanced by sex and rural-urban communities
(500 each). Movement behaviours will be measured using motion trackers worn 24 hours/day for 5 days. Development will encompass physical (e.g., body fat, motor skills), cognitive (e.g., self-control, language skills), and social-emotional (e.g., behaviour problems, social skills) elements.

Results will directly respond to calls for international surveillance of children's movement behaviours and development. Cross-cultural comparisons will lead to a richer understanding of the universal and culturally specific aspects of children's movement behaviours and development."

We have two central hypotheses. First, the early human environment leaves its mark on gene programming, thus changing the program of expression of genes critical for health development through altering the way genes are marked by a chemical coating of DNA termed DNA methylation. Second, responses to early life environment are system wide adaptations that can be observed in the brain as is expected, but also in peripheral tissues such as cells found in saliva. In order to test these hypotheses it is critical to distinguish between differences in DNA methylation driven by inherited genetic variance and those that are consequences of the environment. To achieve this aim we will study twins that inherit the same genes (monozygotic), but often have different prenatal environments, as evidenced by differences in birth weight shown to predict health differences later in life. Cotton swabs will be used to collect buccal epithelial cells from the children at 1 and 12 months after birth for comprehensive DNA methylation mapping. The changes in DNA methylation will be associated with discordance in birth weight and environmental characteristics assessed between 1 and 12 months after birth. Results from this study will provide crucial data on the early gene-environment interactions which may be associated with long term health development. Moreover, DNA methylation profiles from buccal epithelial cells during infancy may serve as non invasive diagnostic biomarkers for identifying children at risk of health problems."

Méthodes. Des données seront collectées auprès de deux sources. D'une part, nous examinerons 20 à 50 textes scientifiques publiés en orthophonie qui se rapportent au sexe ou au genre. D'autre part, nous interviewerons 9 à 15 orthophonistes diversifié·es sur des aspects susceptibles d'influencer leurs discours et leurs pratiques en lien avec le sexe et le genre. Ensuite, nous analyserons les données collectées pour identifier les principaux thèmes qui ressortent à la croisée de l'orthophonie et des concepts de sexe et de genre.

La démarche établira une cartographie des principales représentations du sexe et du genre en orthophonie et de leurs liens avec certaines pratiques cliniques et certains discours sociétaux. Elle comblera un besoin de ressources propres à l'orthophonie pour penser le sexe et le genre et pour agir responsablement par rapport à ces caractéristiques. Elle offrira ainsi aux orthophonistes des moyens d'imaginer le futur de leur profession et, notamment, de la faire évoluer pour favoriser l'équité en santé."
The Children of Multiple Sclerosis: Impact of chronic disease in parents on early childhood development,"['Tremlett, Helen L', 'Hertzman, Clyde']","['Forer, Barry', 'Marrie, Ruth Ann', 'Razaz, Neda', 'Zhao, Yinshan']","['Child Development', 'Data Linkage', 'Epidemiology', 'Health Administrative Data', 'Health Outcomes', 'Multiple Sclerosis']",293288.0,238604,"The early years play a crucial role that extend far beyond childhood. Research has shown that challenges facing adult society, including mental health, obesity, criminality competence in reading and writing have their roots in early childhood. Health Canada has stated that having a parent with a chronic illness, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), puts children 'at risk.' However surprisingly little is known about what these risks are or what could be done about them. MS is a chronic illness which often first starts in early adulthood, at a life stage when parenting is an important issue for many. MS affects the brain and spinal cord, leading to disability and coordination problems; its cause is unknown. Both BC and Canada as a whole have some of the highest prevalence rates of MS in the world, with three more Canadians being diagnosed with MS every day. Our study will be one of the first to investigate developmental well-being in children with a parent affected by MS. Our research will link important province-wide data from both the education and health systems to investigate differences in the quality of stimulation, support and nurturing that children receive by the time they reach kindergarten. Our findings could then be used by communities and government to put programs and policies in place to support healthy child development for children in families affected by a parent with a chronic illness such as MS. Insights from this research may also help other patient groups, such as families affected by cancer and other chronic diseases, thereby helping to maximize the potential of all children."
"Human immunodeficiency virus, antiretroviral drugs and multiple sclerosis risk (HIV-MS)","['Tremlett, Helen L']","['Hogg, Robert S', 'Kingwell, Elaine', 'Salters, Kate', 'Wijnands, José']","['Antiretroviral Therapy', 'Comorbidity', 'Epidemiology', 'Human Immunodeficiency Virus', 'Incidence', 'Multiple Sclerosis', 'Risk Factors']",100000.0,385764,"Effective drugs are now available to treat the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), such that life expectancy of people with HIV can be similar to that of the general population. However, this allows more opportunity to develop other chronic conditions. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord and, despite extensive work, its cause is poorly understood. Evidence suggests that common viral infections, such as the Epstein-Barr virus or human herpesvirus 6 may play a role. More recently, retroviruses, such as HIV, have been suggested. However, no virus has yet been identified as a direct cause, and there is very little understanding of how viruses might change the risk of MS, or how drugs that target these viruses might influence the risk of developing MS or subsequent health outcomes in MS.

The goals of this study are to assess whether infection with HIV, or the drugs used to treat HIV, have the potential to change the risk of developing MS. Furthermore, we will describe the use of health care services, MS and HIV drug prescriptions, and survival in people who have both MS and HIV. We will achieve these goals by using health-related data that have already been collected by doctors and pharmacists, including neurologists and HIV specialists, for over 2 decades in three different countries (Canada, Sweden, and USA). Together, this information allows us to access very large groups of people with and without HIV and MS.

This study will provide valuable knowledge about the role of retroviruses, such as HIV, and the drugs used to treat HIV, on the risk of developing MS and on use of health services, drug treatments and survival for those with both HIV and MS. If we identify a link between HIV or the HIV drug treatments and the risk of MS, this will contribute to our understanding of how MS develops. Our study may also help in the advancement of future strategies to prevent MS or modify health outcomes in MS."

Canada has some of the world's highest rates of MS. This chronic disease of the brain and spinal cord often affects young adults and there is no known cure. In the last two decades, over 10 different drugs have been approved to treat people with MS. These drugs are very expensive and can require regular injections as well as frequent blood tests to monitor safety (side effects). We know how well these drugs work in the short-term, but only against certain aspects of MS. In the real world, people with MS may take these drugs for many years but we do not yet understand all their possible benefits and side effects. There have been few studies as large as ours investigating such a range of possible side effects, including cancer, stroke and infections. We will also look at whether the MS drugs have benefits which are often hard to measure, such as MS disability and fewer hospital or doctors' visits. 

Our research brings together medical data collected for over 2 decades within multiple large health databases in several Canada provinces. No study as large or as comprehensive as ours has ever been done. Our team approach enables findings to be directly relevant to Canadians, including people in poorer communities or those with co-existing medical conditions, who are often excluded from studies. Our research will be independent from the pharmaceutical industry, the manufacturers of MS drugs. This important research will help develop a framework in which to evaluate the benefits and side effects of both the current and future new drugs for MS across Canada.

Our study findings will provide much needed information to help treatment-related decision making for both patients and doctors. Ultimately our study findings will directly benefit the outcomes related to treatment and health-related quality of life of people living with MS."

Estimation of the level of inconsistency among sources of evidence that are commonly found in published networks of trials,"['Tricco, Andrea C', 'Straus, Sharon E']","['Hamid, Jemila', 'Veroniki, Areti Angeliki']","['Bayesian Analysis', 'Coherence', 'Consistency', 'Inconsistency Variance', 'Intervention Studies', 'Meta-Epidemiology', 'Multiple Treatments', 'Network Meta-Analysis', 'Prediction', 'Systematic Review']",98606.0,327719,"Over the past 2 decades, the alternative treatment options for the same clinical condition and the ever-increasing number of clinical trials has considerably increased the conduct of systematic reviews including network meta-analysis (NMA). NMA compares the efficacy of all available treatments assuming consistency, whereby different sources of evidence in the network should be in agreement. A potential violation of consistency may lead to misleading results. Despite the efforts of researchers to construct a consistent network of treatments, significant inconsistency may arise which should be investigated when found. One of the strategies suggested to tackle inconsistency is to encompass it in the NMA results and apply inconsistency models relaxing the consistency assumption. This is a similar approach that researchers use to conduct a pairwise meta-analysis using the random effects model. In such models, an extra variation is added, named the inconsistency variance, so as to incorporate any unexplained inconsistency. However, in networks with only a few closed loops (i.e. certain paths in the network of evidence that start and end at the same treatment node via one or more intermediate treatments) and a small number of studies in each closed loop, it is difficult to estimate the inconsistency parameters and inconsistency variance. Bayesian models allow incorporation of external evidence on inconsistency variance, and offer advantages over conventional inconsistency models where no prior information on inconsistency is considered. This research will provide empirical evidence on the extent of the inconsistency variance, which will be particularly beneficial in NMAs with few closed loops and few included studies. The comparison of the estimated magnitude of inconsistency variance in a network with the empirical distribution of inconsistency variance can provide insight into the validity of the NMA results and inform decision making."
The development of a risk of bias assessment tool for network meta-analysis,"['Tricco, Andrea C', 'Whiting, Penny', 'Wright, James M']","['Hutton, Brian E', 'Lunny, Carole A', 'Straus, Sharon E', 'Tunis, Matthew C', 'Veroniki, Areti Angeliki', 'Watt, Jennifer A']","['Critical Appraisal', 'Development Of Methods And Tools', 'Meta-Epidemiology', 'Methodology', 'Patient Oriented Research', 'Quality', 'Reducing Bias And Error', 'Research On Research', 'Risk Of Bias']",360116.0,433402,"Being able to critically appraise the findings of studies is central to informed decision-making in patient care. Patients, healthcare providers and policy makers (i.e. knowledge users [KUs]) need the highest quality studies to make decisions about which treatments should be used in healthcare practice. The most reliable way to answer questions using research is a systematic review, which is the most common type of knowledge synthesis used to summarize all existing medical literature on a topic. These reviews are needed to support patient care, develop policies, and assess new drugs and devices. 
Currently there are many different types of systematic reviews, such as scoping reviews, reviews with meta-analysis, and reviews with network meta-analysis (NMA). Reviews with NMA can rank and order medicines used for the same medical condition by their safety and effectiveness. Many tools are used to assess the potential biases in these different reviews. For example, the AMSTAR checklist assesses whether a review with pairwise meta-analysis (MA) has been well conducted. The ROBIS tool assesses whether a MA is at risk of containing dangerous biases that may distort the findings. However, no tool currently exists specifically to assess the risk of bias in a review with NMA.
Our project has 4 objectives. First we will identify biases that are found in NMAs through a methodological review (a type of knowledge synthesis where all the evidence on a given methods topic is identified and described). Second, we will select the most important biases to be included in the tool through an agreement-building process (Delphi) and finalise the tool. Third, we will use 3 examples to test the usability of the tool through an evaluative pilot study, and four, develop a KT strategy. Our outputs will be 4 journal articles, presentations, video, webinar and plain language products. Our newly developed tool will help KUs choose the highest quality NMA, which will improve evidenced-based care."

Maintenance of behaviour change was not a focus in the previous trial. As such, all components of the previous intervention including the RiseTx application and wearable activity tracker will be retained and we will provide additional behavioural support through videoconferencing to maintain behaviour change, which is an extension of our prior work. The intervention will consist of five phases consisting of behavioural counselling (e.g., goal setting, action planning) and daily step goals of 3000 (i.e., using an activity monitor; Fitbits) over the average of their baseline week at the end of 12 weeks. Prostate cancer survivors in the control group will receive Fitbits only with no further resources. This intervention has high potential for broad reach as it can ultimately be delivered through internet- and mobile-based applications. With internet usage growing fastest among older Canadians, our study will create a unique distance-based platform that could be scaled for use by clinical and community-based organizations as a low-cost, supportive care tool to improve quality of life for all cancer survivors."

Lung cancer, caused primarily by smoking, is the second most common cancer in both men and women, and is the leading cause of cancer death in Canada.  A significant amount of medical attention has been devoted to developing strategies to help smokers quit. As a result, the prevalence of smokers in Canada has continued to decline. However, it is imperative that we continue to develop innovative approaches to aiding smoking cessation. Exercise has received ample support as an effective smoking cessation aid, as it not only assists with relieving nicotine withdrawal symptoms but also minimizes post-cessation weight gain, a pressing concern for many smokers hoping quit. Research has shown that pairing exercise with traditional smoking cessation aids, such as Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) can increase the success of quit rates. Applying these positive research findings into the real-world setting is necessary to improving health at a population-level. The goal of my master's thesis is to utilize the research findings from the exercise-based smoking cessation research trial, situated out of our laboratory at the University of Western Ontario, and develop a quit smoking program at the YMCA in London, Ontario that aims to help smokers quit cigarettes in a healthy manner with the assistance of exercise."

However, the risk of transfusion transmitted infections for which testing is not currently performed continues to be a concern. Among these untested infectious agents is Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) which, in the transplant setting, is associated with a malignant tumor of white blood cells. This is an especially serious complication in infants and young children who are exposed to the virus shortly after their transplant. EBV is also associated with many other complications. It is imperative to track the source of virus and find ways to prevent its transmission to patients at risk. We therefore propose to undertake an epidemiological study in children receiving umbilical cord-blood and bone marrow transplants. Our objective is to examine the incidence of post-transplant Epstein-Barr virus infection in these children and its association with blood product transfusion. To do this we have designed a multicenter prospective cohort study involving several sites in Canada and the USA. We will collect data from patient charts to help us determine the level of transfusion-related risk for acquiring Epstein-Barr virus infection. Demonstrating transmission of Epstein-Barr virus via transfusion in these patients may give rise to new policies which in turn may have significant implications with regard to the morbidity and mortality associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection."

HPV is recognized unequivocally as the main causal factor for cervical cancer, is thought to be responsible for a substantial proportion of many other anogenital neoplasms and a non negligible portion of head and neck cancers (oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx) and is suspected to play a causal role in many other neoplasms, such as conjunctiva carcinoma. HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the world and the prevalence can reach 30-40% among young sexually active women of reproductive age. A high probability of perinatal transmission of HPV is supported by several studies, although methodological limitations (small sample size, short follow-up, sample contamination, etc.) hamper definitive conclusions. Even if it is imperative to answer questions about HPV in children, currently there is a paucity of firm data available. This pilot cohort study is designed to establish the risk of perinatal transmission of type-specific HPV to the mucosa of newborns (conjunctival, pharyngeal, bucal and genital), delineate the risk factors associated with perinatal transmission, determine the risk of persistence of HPV infection among children, analyse the risk factors associated with persistence, characterize the presence of antibodies against HPV in infected mothers and their children and assess the prevalence of HPV in placenta specimen and its relationship with adverse pregnancy outcome. This pilot project will serve as a template to apply relevant technical and scientific adjustments to the research protocol before going on with a larger sample and longer follow-up. The study will improve our understanding of the natural history of HPV across the lifespan. This, in turn, may identify a possible point at which to intervene to prevent HPV infection."

A Meta-analysis of Children's Activity During Physical Education Lessons Taught by Generalist and Specialist Teachers,"['Truelove, Stephanie']",['N/A'],"['Accelerometry', 'Elementary School', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Physical Activity', 'Physical Education', 'Sedentary Time', 'Systematic Review', 'Teacher']",1000.0,411987,"Physical education (PE) class allows for regular and structured opportunities to be active during the school day, while providing time for children to develop the skills, knowledge, and attitudes needed to lead a healthy active lifestyle. However, quality of instruction and physical activity opportunities vary as specialists do not exclusively teach PE at the elementary school level. Therefore, it becomes the responsibility of the classroom teacher (i.e., generalist teacher) to teach this subject, despite possessing, in some cases, little or no PE knowledge or qualifications. The purpose of this review was to explore the extent to which teacher specialization contributes to physical activity accumulation and sedentary time in this environment. Seven databases were searched for peer-reviewed, English-language, original research. Percentage of PE lesson spent in moderate-to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) and sedentary time was synthesized across two types of teachers: generalists and specialists. Of the 42 articles included in this review, 32 assessed physical activity/sedentary time during PE offered by specialist teachers, nine assessed PE offered by generalist teachers, and one presented results for both types of teachers. Subgroup analyses found that children spent an average of 33.8% of their PE class time in MVPA when taught by a specialist, and 29.9% of their PE class time in MVPA when a generalist was responsible for instruction. Similarly, children spent 34.2% of PE class time in sedentary pursuits under the instruction of a specialist, and 40.9% of PE class time when taught by a generalist teacher. Overall, this review highlights that regardless of teacher specialization, physical activity levels during PE class at the elementary school level are much lower than the recommendation of 50% of lesson time spent in MVPA."
Promoting Food Literacy: facilitators and barriers to educational interventions,"['Truman, Emily J']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,364858,"Given rising levels of obesity and poor eating habits, food education is needed to enable Canadians to make informed choices in a complex food landscape. ""Food literacy"" provides individuals with specialized skills and knowledge that enable them to make better choices about what they eat, contributing to improved long-term health and wellbeing. Food literacy programs are growing in popularity in public health, but they still face significant barriers that prevent effective use.

This presentation examines existing research on food literacy to identify factors that both prevent and promote the successful implementation of food literacy programs. This information was collected through a systematic literature review (scoping review) of academic and non-academic research on the topic of food literacy. The search located 1049 documents, of which 28 were identified as unique studies reporting factors that both promote and prevent successful food literacy programming. These factors were recorded, along with information on study type, country of origin, and population targeted. 

The results of the study demonstrate that a there are wide variety of factors affecting the design and use of food literacy programs: study types are diverse; the largest number of studies are Canadian based; and there is a dual focus on adult skill and knowledge acquisition and the design of child/adolescent focused educational programming. These results suggest that more work is needed to understand and address this wide variety of factors and suggest best practices for improving how programs are designed and carried out. A more thorough understanding of the challenges facing food literacy initiatives contributes not only to improved program content, but also to improved long-term individual and population health."
Evaluating the impact of a media literacy and food marketing intervention for children,"['Truman, Emily J']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Award'],1500.0,400270,"In light of children's exposure to high levels of food marketing, media literacy skills are needed to navigate advertising appeals promoting the consumption of unhealthy (e.g., high fat, salt and sugar) foods. Health-promoting media literacy education encourages children to use analytical skills to critically examine media messages, and recognize their influence on perceptions, in order to make more informed health choices. However, there is limited research on media literacy intervention efficacy where nutrition promotion is concerned, including how to measure the acquisition of analytical skills needed to navigate food marketing appeals. This study addresses those gaps through the evaluation of evidence-based health-promoting media literacy lesson plans for children focusing on critical knowledge of food marketing and packaging. 

Two evidence-based ""Media Literacy & Food Marketing"" lesson plans developed for grades 3-6, and grades 6-9, were used by teachers in the classroom. A measurement tool (four question assignment) was created to assess children's pre and post-lesson levels of critical knowledge about packaged food and marketing messages, in relation to specific core constructs contained within the lesson plans (e.g., analysis and evaluation skills). A total of 71 students participated from grades five, seven, eight, and nine, from two Alberta schools (one urban, one rural). Qualitative analysis (using Nvivo 12) of the participant responses showed small relative increases in analysis and evaluation skills in post-lesson responses, in comparison with pre-lesson answers. Students were better able to understand food marketing appeals, and to assess the nutritional content of packaged foods. This study provides researchers, educators and practitioners with an approach to evaluating the acquisition of critical analytical skills around food, nutrition and health which have the potential to support informed food choices."

Children are particularly vulnerable as their brains are rapidly developing and their capacity to protect themselves from heat and its impacts is limited. Few studies have examined how heat affects mental health in children, especially in the Global South.

In my research, I will assess whether being exposed to heat affects the mental health of children living in Accra, Ghana, and identify whether some children may be more vulnerable than others. I will first map the distribution of heat across the city and examine the urban characteristics of hotter versus cooler parts of the city. I will then assess whether heat affects children's mental health. Finally, I will evaluate whether some children are more affected than others because of their gender, ethnicity or where they live. 

My work will provide new evidence of how exposure to heat affects children's mental health. These results will help inform Accra's strategies of adapting to heat by taking local characteristics and children's mental well-being into consideration. Findings from this work can also contribute to identifying effective actions that will support the mental health of other children in the global community facing the perils of heat stress from climate change."
"Utilizing Indigenous Knowledge and Western Science as Complementary Constructs: The Synchronization of Traditional Harvesting Activities and Agroforestry Community Gardens to form a Sustainable Import-Substitution Strategy for Enhancing Food Security in Subarctic Ontario, Canada","['Tsuji, Leonard J']","['Hanning, Rhona M', 'Oelbermann, Maren']","['Adaptation', 'Agroforestry', 'First Nations', 'Food Security', 'Knowledge Systems', 'Nutrition', 'Obesity', 'Subarctic', 'Sustainability', 'Traditional Foods']",419887.0,292392,"The Food Security Assembly has defined food security as ""the assurance that all people at all times have both the physical and economic access to the food they need for an active, healthy life."" Food security has been recognized as a determinant of health. Position papers on food security in Canada point to the unique food security challenges faced by Aboriginal people living in remote-northern communities, such as, the higher cost of living, and limited access to healthy foods. However, the types of interventions in the north have been limited, as the northern food system has not been seen or addressed as a whole, but rather as separate pieces of a complex puzzle. We address this shortcoming in our proposed project by forming a sustainable import-substitution strategy based on traditional activities (e.g., hunting overabundant waterfowl, wood heating), with their by-products (e.g., offal, potash) being used to fertilize agroforestry community gardens. Agroforestry is a recent term for an ancient practice of combining woody perennials (e.g., trees) with crops in spatial and temporal arrangements that optimize beneficial biological interactions. Being more diverse, and thus more resilient to environmental disturbance than conventional agriculture, agroforestry stewardship has the potential to act as a more reliable local-food system in light of global warming, especially in the north. Expected benefits of this initiative include: enhanced food security due to the sharing of traditional meats, fruits and vegetables, and associated health benefits at the individual, household and community levels; and the proposed study will provide First Nations, health care professionals, planners and policy makers with new information on food security interventions in relation to northern First Nations, in light of a more holistic approach."
A Community-based Approach to Pandemic Planning: Swine Flu (H1N1) and Remote First Nation communities of sub-arctic Ontario.,"['Tsuji, Leonard J']","['Sutherland, Celine']","['Community Planning', 'Community-Based Approach', 'First Nations', 'H1n1', 'Health Planning', 'Remote Communities']",100000.0,198473,"In March 2009, an outbreak of a severe acute respiratory infection occurred in Mexico, now known to be caused by a novel subtype of influenza A virus, the H1N1 (swine) flu. After spreading to over 48 countries, the World Health Organization on June 11, 2009, declared the first global pandemic in 41 years. H1N1 is similar to the ""Spanish Flu"" of 1918, where some Aboriginal communities suffered a mortality rate of 50%, compared to the Canadian mortality rate of non-Aboriginal communities of only 0.3%. Recent data indicate that Canada's First Nation population has been disproportionately affected by the H1N1 flu virus, especially remote, northern communities. Differences in social, economic, and environmental factors, along with differences in public health preparedeness, may account for the high rates of the H1N1 flu in Aboriginal populations. A reveiw of the federal, provincial, and local pandemic influenza plans has revealed that although some of the First Nation communities' unique concerns were being mentioned, it was unclear how the special needs needs of the remote First Nations were being addressed. Remote Cree First Nations of the western James Bay region have recently faced outbreaks of H1N1 associated with the emerging waves of the current pandemic. Our proposed study aims to address the concerns of Directors/Supervisors of Health Services in some of these communities who feel that existing pandemic plans were not sufficient with regards to addressing the unique conditions that exist in their remote communities. Our proposed study will investigate how existing pandemic plans can be improved with community input, to address the unique conditions of remore First Nations. The pandemic plans based on the results of the present study should allow remote First Nations to be better prepared to respond before, during, and after a pandemic; thus, improving the general health of these remote communities."

Food insecurity exists when people do not have adequate physical, social or economic access to food as defined above. Food security has been recognized as a determinant of health and individuals experiencing food insecurity are at a greater risk for many negative health consequences. Historically, the Omushkego Cree of northern Ontario, Canada, have had to deal with recurring periods of food insecurity. At present, one of the barriers to the consumption of healthy traditional foods is the expense associated with harvesting. Thus, people that formerly consumed a more nutritious wild meat diet became more dependent on cheap, non-nutritious, store-bought food. Our intervention would support First Nations people who could not afford to harvest traditional game by transporting them up to Cape Henrietta Maria, Ontario, to hunt spring snow geese (Chen caerulescens); the harvesters would use only steel shotshell, so as not to lead contaminate the meat. It should also be noted that the over-population of snow geese is destroying the environment; this is well documented. So the First Nation harvesters through the proposed intervention would be receiving many benefits: an uncontaminated, nutritious source of traditional food (snow goose); participating in the harvesting aspect of their culture, which also has important social benefits associated with well-being; protecting the environment for future generations by participating in the North-American wide, snow goose harvest initiative; and addressing the food security issue not only at the harvester level, but at the community level by ""sharing the harvest"". We would evaluate the effectiveness of the program both qualitatively and quantitatively."

Reduce the degree of exposure to the hazard; 2. Increase the ability to cope."" (FAO 2008:2). It is widely accepted that climate change has disproportionately impacted subarctic and arctic regions of Canada and the Aboriginal (First Nations, Inuit, and Metis) people who have called this land home for millennia. As ice thickness has been affected and varies within a year, having information on the safety of ice-based, travel routes on an hourly/daily/weekly basis would be of great importance to these communities who use frozen water as transportation corridors. To reduce the degree of exposure to unsafe travel routes, there is a need for the monitoring of environmental change using both scientific and Indigenous knowledge. Working with the Cree people of subarctic Ontario, our research team has developed an innovative, interactive web-based informatics tool that utilizes high-resolution satellite imagery and real-time capabilities. Features of the informatics tool would allow individuals in remote communities to work together in a social network to gather, store, process, and present spatially-referenced knowledge (e.g., pictures, narratives, videos, etc.) in real-time. The first part of the proposed project will reduce the degree of exposure to a hazard (unsafe, ice-based, travel routes).  The second part of the project will increase the ability of northern Aboriginal people to cope with sea-level change by constructing a state-of-the-art, online, freely available system that predicts sea-level change in northern Canada, to allow for adaptive health planning. The vulnerability of northern coastal communities to sea-level change varies considerably between locations; sea level will rise in some areas and fall in other areas. As sea-level change is area specific, it follows that environmental health planning must also be area specific based on the best information available, which we will provide"

In a previous CIHR-funded project, we successfully pioneered agroforestry practices in subarctic Indigenous communities; our on-the-land program viewed global warming as an opportunity to grow vegetables in subarctic Canada under ambient conditions, by extending the historical distributional range of produce. Agroforestry is a more sustainable agricultural stewardship practice that combines woody perennials (trees, shrubs) with crops in arrangements that optimizes yields of vegetables and fruit. Being more diverse, and thus more resilient to environmental disturbance than conventional agriculture, agroforestry stewardship has the potential to act as a more reliable local-food system. Further, we harmonized agroforestry activities with traditional harvesting activities - utilizing the by-products of goose harvesting (e.g. offal, bones) to make a locally-sourced, nutrient-rich fertilizer - to form a more sustainable import-substitution strategy.

Health benefits are evident in children as young as 2 years of age. Although an important behaviour, many preschool-aged children (i.e., 2.5-5 years) are not sufficiently active. A strong body of Canadian literature suggests that low levels of PA participation are evident among preschoolers at childcare. This is a concern as PA levels tend to decrease by 50% between the ages of 3 and 4 years, and remain significantly lower by age 5, emphasizing the need to intervene early. In addition, the literature supports a positive link between physical activity and weight status, heart health, cognitive development, and bone health. Approximately 80% of preschoolers are cared for out of the home by a non-family member. With the increasing rates of children enrolled in formal childcare, coupled with the fact that the childcare centre itself has been identified as having a more important influence on PA behaviours than individual-level factors (e.g., age, sex, and ethnicity), the need for health promotion programming within this particular setting seems evident. Researchers have previously examined specific characteristics of childcare centres which encourage PA participation. In an effort to support increased activity levels, childcare providers reported improved training, additional equipment and space, and the benefit of guest PA teachers as ideal intervention characteristics. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop and implement an evidence-based PA intervention for preschoolers attending centre-based childcare. This intervention will entail environmental modifications (including the addition of new equipment), providing unstructured outdoor activity (in four 30 minute increments) and providing childcare staff training. The proposed study will be one of the first Canadian studies aimed at creating a health promotion-based physical activity intervention for preschoolers attending centre-based childcare."

One way to prevent and reduce obesity is physical activity participation. Regular physical activity offers many physical and mental health benefits, including protection against obesity. Yet despite the benefits of physical activity, many preschoolers do not engage in enough activity. This is concerning, as physical activity levels have been shown to decrease with age, suggesting that Canada's children may become less active and more likely to be overweight and obese as adults. The preschool years have been identified as an ideal time to get involved, as childhood interventions may promote lifelong healthy behaviours before unhealthy habits develop. Given the large number of Canadian children that attend childcare outside of the home, facilities such as full day kindergarten centres, centre-based and home-based childcare represent ideal venues for supporting physical activity participation among young children. Currently, there is a lack of information documenting physical activity levels among preschool-aged children. This project aims to fill this research gap by examining the extent to which (if at all) the physical activity behaviours of preschoolers in full-day learning differs from those of preschoolers attending centre and home-based childcare. As a secondary focus, this study will compare preschoolers' physical activity levels to the National Association for Sport and Physical Education physical activity guideline and identify if differences exist between early learning facilities: polices, curriculum, and practices and the impact on preschoolers' physical activity level. The information gained through this research will help policy and decision-makers, teachers, and childcare providers implement and modify early learning curriculum, policies and practices to help Canada's preschool-aged children become sufficiently physically active."

To achieve these aims, we have assembled an expert community-academic team from Ontario, BC and Quebec that is well positioned to conduct this CBR initiative, and to mobilize the critical research evidence generated to inform and influence: (1) best practices in food and support programs and services in the community; and (2) policies that limit the availability and access to appropriate food sources and nutrition for people living with HIV in Canada. This will be the first time in the history and evolution of the CIHR HIV/AIDS CBR program that clinical and community cohort data from three major regions in Canada will be brought together to address the health needs of people living with HIV/AIDS.
Major Objectives: (1) To assess the prevalence of general and various sub-types of food insecurity  (i.e. food insufficiency, poor food quality/diversity, and range of methods of food acquisition) among individuals with HIV in BC, ON and QC; (2) To examine the socio-demographic and determinants of health correlates of general food insecurity and sub-types of food insecurity among individuals with HIV in BC, ON and QC; (3) To examine whether having adequate, appropriate and stable food security is associated with improved access to medical care among individuals with HIV in BC, ON and QC; and (4) To examine the clinical and health-related quality of life outcomes and survival benefits associated with having adequate, appropriate and stable food security and access to food programs in individuals with HIV in BC, ON and QC."
Evaluating the impact of a province-wide capacity building intervention on nutrition policies and practices in early years providers,"['Tugault-Lafleur, Claire']",['N/A'],"['Child Health', 'Childcare', 'Childcare Food Environments', 'Childcare Food Policies', 'Early Years', 'Eating Habits', 'Policy Implementation', 'Population-Based Interventions']",165000.0,396203,"The early years of life are critical for lifelong health. Sadly, many Canadian preschoolers do not meet national dietary recommendations for vegetables and fruit while frequently consuming foods of little nutritional value. In 2016, the BC government and partners developed a capacity-building intervention to support the implementation of recommended practices encouraging physical activity and healthy eating in childcare settings. Research is underway to evaluate whether this intervention has improved childcare's policies and practices around children's physical activity. My research will expand the focus to healthy eating and add indicators to the assessments already underway and proposed. My specific aims are to: 1) define the factors (individual, childcare settings and regional) that facilitate or hinder full implementation of these new recommendations ; 2) assess whether the provincial intervention changed childcare providers' nutrition policies and practices; and 3) evaluate whether children aged 3-5 years attending childcare centres that adhere to these recommendations have healthier dietary behaviours and lower nutritional risk scores compared to children attending childcare centres that do not adhere to these recommendations. These aims will be met by: 1) conducting 60 min interviews with childcare providers to gain an in-depth understanding of the factors that influence the implementation of these new recommended practices; 2) analyzing data from province-wide surveys to examine longitudinal change in childcare providers' healthy eating policies and practices; 3) collecting child-level dietary data using the Nutrition Screening Tool for Every Preschooler (NutriSTEP®). My findings will provide invaluable information about the food environments and dietary behaviours children in childcare settings and help decision makers tailor approaches in the early years."
Can Patient Decision Aids Improve Shared Decision Making and Reduce Gender Disparity in the Utilization of Total Knee Arthroplasty?  A Pilot Study,"['Tugwell, Peter S', 'Hawker, Gillian A']","['Borkhoff, Cornelia M', 'Dervin, Geoffrey F', 'Kreder, Hans J', 'Stacey, Dawn']","['Disparity', 'Gender', 'Patient Decision Aid', 'Shared Decision Making', 'Standardized Patients', 'Total Knee Arthroplasty']",110416.0,211617,"Total knee replacement (TKR) surgery is recommended for relieving pain and restoring function in people living with moderate to severe osteoarthritis (OA) when medical treatment fails. Unmet need for TKR is three times greater in women as compared to men. Using ""mystery"" patients - 1 man and 1 woman - with moderate knee OA and identical clinical scenarios, we demonstrated that doctors were less likely to recommend TKR when the patient was a woman compared to a man. These findings suggest that gender bias may partly explain gender differences in rates of use of TKR. Patient decision aids (PtDAs) may address this health care inequity as they prepare patients for an informed discussion about treatment options with their doctor and help doctors to be more aware of patients' preferences. The objective of the proposed pilot study is to test the feasibility of recruiting orthopaedic surgeons who are willing to implement PtDAs into clinical practice and perform blinded audiotaped assessments of ""mystery"" patients for the planned larger-scale study that will determine if PtDAs are an effective intervention to reduce gender differences in rates of use of TKR. We propose to complete a pilot test of the study protocol with 16 orthopaedic surgeons to establish the study procedures for the definitive trial."
Immigrant health in Canada: the hidden workforce of immigrant community health workers to reduce health inequities,"['Tugwell, Peter S', 'Pottie, Kevin', 'Welch, Vivian A']","['Ahmed, Rukhsana', 'Andrew, Caroline P', 'Bourgeault, Ivy L', 'Desmeules, Marie R', 'Greenaway, Christina A', 'Hatcher Roberts, Janet Louise L', 'Kirmayer, Laurence J', 'Labonté, Ronald', 'Newbold, K.

Immigrants (a quarter million annually) arrive healthier than the Canadian born population, but shortly after arrival their health status begins to decline. There is accumulating evidence that social determinants of health- the living conditions immigrants experience in Canada- play an important role in this decline. Barriers to health and community services are at the forefront of this problem both in Canada and internationally.

What is the hypothesis?
Immigrant community health workers are emerging as an untapped community labour force that can help immigrants overcome language, cultural, and system barriers and potentially prevent future health inequities for immigrants (>20% of Canada's population). 

What are the objectives of the research program?
Little is published about the effects of this labour force in addressing social determinants of health, and the cost of not addressing these concerns. This research program aims to identify, describe and evaluate models of engaging immigrant community health workers in Canada to reduce preventable and unjust health inequalities. Our program will include systematic reviews, community consultations, feasibility studies, and a multicity evaluation of models of engagement of immigrant community health workers with an economic analysis.

What will be the end result? 
Our research will determine the skills and contributions of immigrant community health workers and the most effective methods to engage this labour force to improve health of immigrant communities. We will develop a knowledge translation strategy with our stakeholders to communicate our findings to potential adopters: government and community-based health organizations."

First Nations adults living off reserve and Métis adults have a higher chance of suffering from arthritis compared to non-Indigenous adults. To date, the extent to which population characteristics have been considered in the treatment of musculoskeletal conditions has not been assessed. 

Our objective is to identify and prioritize effective interventions for treating osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis that could reduce health inequities.

Understanding Recent Trends in Chlamydia in Ontario Using Applied Epidemiology and Mathematical Modeling,"['Tuite, Ashleigh']",['N/A'],"['Chlamydia Trachomatis', 'Epidemiology', 'Health Economics', 'Mathematical Modeling', 'Public Health', 'Sexually Transmitted Infections']",70000.0,283900,"Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection and is the most common infectious disease in Canada. Although most people infected with Chlamydia have no or mild symptoms, if untreated, it can cause pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) in women, a condition that is associated with infertility, ectopic (tubal) pregnancy, and chronic pelvic pain. A screening test can be used to identify and treat individuals who are infected with Chlamydia but have no symptoms. Canada has expanded screening programs over the past 20 years, with the aim of decreasing the number of Chlamydia infections. However, the opposite effect has been observed; Chlamydia infections continue to increase in the population. The goal of the current project is try to understand why Chlamydia infections are not decreasing, even though we are finding and treating more cases. We think that this increase is to be expected, because we are screening and testing more people who don't have symptoms. To test this idea, we are working with public health units in Ontario to look at trends in the number of Chlamydia cases, the number of screening tests they are performing, and the number of PID cases that are occurring. If we are finding and treating more cases in people who would otherwise go on to develop PID, we would expect to see a decrease in the number of PID cases reported over time. We will use statistical methods to test this hypothesis. We will use these results to construct mathematical models, which are simplified representations of how Chlamydia is spread in a population. These models will help us to understand why we are observing an increase in Chlamydia cases over time, and will let us test, in a simulated environment, how different strategies for controlling Chlamydia might alter disease patterns in the future. Using these models, we can also assess how much we expect these different strategies to cost, since health care decision-making occurs in the context of limited resources."
The impact of childhood bullying on high-risk sexual behaviour among gay and bisexual men.,"['Tulloch, Tyler']",['N/A'],"['Hiv Prevention', 'Hiv Transmission', 'Msm', 'Psychological Predictors', 'Sexual Functioning', 'Sexual Health', 'Sexual Risk Behaviours']",8750.0,258140,"Despite education and prevention efforts aimed at reducing high-risk sexual behaviour among men who have sex with men (MSM), MSM continue to have disproportionately higher rates of HIV infection than any other group in Canada. MSM also suffer from mental health problems such as mood, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders at a higher rate than their heterosexual counterparts, and research has shown a positive correlation between psychological problems and sexual risk-taking among adult MSM. One possible cause of mental health problems and HIV risk behaviour is the severity of bullying during childhood.  Evidence suggests that being the recipient of childhood bullying is associated with poor mental health outcomes among MSM. The present study will examine the association between childhood bullying severity and high-risk sexual behaviour among MSM such as number of high-risk sexual partners and number of instances of unprotected anal intercourse.  It will also examine the role that social anxiety, internalized homophobia, and self-esteem play in the association between childhood bullying and high-risk sexual behaviour among MSM. The present study will help researchers to better understand some of the factors that influence risky sexual behaviour in order to design more effective HIV prevention and mental health programs for this vulnerable population with the goal of reducing both mental health problems and HIV sexual risk behaviour in this high-risk population."

CM is a novel approach that aims to understand how research and knowledge utilization process evolve. CM can serve as an innovative tool to improve the impact of research projects by engaging with key stakeholders (researchers, advocates, policy makers, etc) to determine what they identify as effective actions that lead research to translate into positive public health impact(s). As a result, CM provides research projects with tangible actions that serve as the bridge between the knowledge to policy/practice gap. CM will be used to investigate two CIHR-funded projects addressing risky behaviours in youth with an aim to identify effective actions by key stakeholders. Through the unique contribution of CM, this research will build capacity for future projects to improve their KT and policy impact by providing some insight to bridge the knowledge to practice/policy gap."

Abnormal changes to gut bacteria in babies are likely to lead to the development of childhood obesity and allergies. Recent studies provide evidence that babies who grow up in homes with a pet are less likely to develop overweight and allergies than children who live pet-free. These findings support the notion that keeping children's environments overly sanitized is not good for their health. So, how do pets protect babies against these diseases? It's not entirely clear, but is likely due to the fact that pet exposure enhances levels of beneficial gut bacteria in babies, subsequently boosting immune maturation. In fact, preliminary results from the SyMBIOTA research program show that pet ownership can enhance bacterial species richness and diversity. However, the consequences of pet-induced changes to bacteria on the immune system maturation in the infant gut and health benefits have not yet been studied.
My goal is to systematically investigate how household pets influence infant gut bacteria, metabolites they produce and gut immune maturation, as well as whether those influences can reduce childhood allergies and obesity. This study will employ SyMBIOTA and the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) birth cohort study as a research platform. My proposed research aims to provide evidence for this ""microbiome hypothesis"", with the potential to impact clinical guidance."

Perception of Pain among Aboriginal Individuals: Perspectives of Patients and Care Providers,"['Turcotte, Kara K']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal Health', 'Chronic Pain', 'Coping And Wellbeing', 'Pain Expression', 'Pain Perception', 'Qualitative Data Analysis', 'Quantitative Data Analysis']",72000.0,272441,"One in five Canadians suffer from chronic pain. Epidemiological surveys in Canada indicate the prevalence of chronic pain is higher among Aboriginal (i.e. First-Nation, Metis, Inuit) populations. This is consistent with the broader scientific literature revealing a large disparity in the health of Non-Aboriginal vs. Aboriginal individuals. Research suggests that the way in which people describe their pain may vary by race and ethnicity and that health care providers may react differently to pain reported by patients of varying racial and ethnic characteristics. However, the extent to which these issues contribute to worse pain and pain treatment among Aboriginal peoples remains relatively unexplored.

The first goal of this research is to understand if there is a systematic difference in how Aboriginal vs. non-Aboriginal individuals describe their pain. The second goal is to assess if formal caregivers perceive pain differently in Aboriginal vs. non-Aboriginal individuals. In the first phase, a small sample of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal chronic pain suffers will be recruited from community health centers to take part in a brief qualitative interview about their pain experience. In the second phase, formal caregivers, nurses, will be recruited to participate in an online study. Participants will be presented with a random selection of medical case history vignettes, created based on the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal patients recruited in the first phase, and asked to report on the patient's pain intensity. Differences in treatment suggestions based on patient's ethnicity will be assessed. Related factors such as how empathy impacts caregiver's accuracy in pain assessment will be investigated.

If a systematic difference exists in how Aboriginal vs. non-Aboriginal individuals describe their pain or how formal caregivers assess their pain, care for Aboriginal individuals can be improved by increasing Aboriginal cultural competence during professional training."

Though typically short-lived, a substantial minority COVID-19 patients report long-lasting olfactory problems. Olfactory dysfunction is related to a range of social and emotional impairments, including elevated rates of depression, anxiety, social isolation, and relationship difficulties. Although these links are well documented, we know relatively little about why and how these problems are linked. Our first aim is to capitalize on this rare opportunity to examine the pathways linking olfactory loss to social and emotional problems. We will recruit adults online reporting recent onset of olfactory dysfunction and no other flu-like symptoms (N=300) as well as a control cohort (N=100). Participants will monitor their olfactory ability, social interactions, and mental health for 8 weeks, covering the typical period of olfactory recovery in COVID-19 patients. These data will provide a first-ever look at how within-person changes in olfaction relate to changes in social behavior and emotional wellbeing.

Moreover, given that COVID-19 associated smell disorders are likely to exist for many years to come as this illness becomes endemic, mitigating the impacts of olfactory dysfunction is an emerging health priority. Our second aim is to develop a brief, scalable, online intervention to mitigate the emotional and social consequences of olfactory loss. We will conduct a randomized pilot trial on a subset of participants (n=100) who receive two tailored 3-week behavioral interventions focused on bolstering social support and mitigating social avoidance. Patient engagement and satisfaction will inform intervention refinement, with the eventual goal of offering the web modules freely and publicly. Our findings will inform future efforts to improve mental health for people with olfactory dysfunctions, including those dealing with sudden onset due to COVID-19."

Although it is clear that balance between the gut microbiota and the immune system is critical to the prevention of inflammation of the gut, what role a person's genes may play in controlling this ""homeostasis"" is only now being appreciated. We have recently identified a variation in a specific gene, known to be responsible for protection against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and associated with differences in gut microbiome composition and function. What is not known is if other genetic factors could also alter the gut microbiome. We hypothesize that the composition and function of the gut microbiome is directly influenced by host genetic makeup. Our objective is to analyze the gut bacteria composition and function in healthy subjects who are first degree relatives of individuals who have IBD and hence are more likely to carry the genes associated with the risk of developing disease. We have access to a large cohort of healthy first degree relatives being recruited as part of the CCFC GEM Project. First objective of this study will be to analyze the types of bacterial found in the stool samples of 2100 subjects in this population and determine if any differences are correlated with the gene variations found in the subjects. The second objective will be to determine if any differences in microbial function, both in terms of the bacterial genes and the bacterial products, are correlated with the genotype of the subjects.

Early-life factors and later-life cognitive resilience: Linking evidence across a lifetime,"['Tyas, Suzanne L']","['Maxwell, Colleen J', 'Riley, Kathryn', 'SantaCruz, Karen S', 'St.John, Philip D', 'Zeng, Leilei']","['Cognition', 'Early-Life Factors', 'Epidemiology', 'Life Course', 'Longitudinal Study', 'Multi-State Models']",180000.0,305672,"It is said that we begin to age the day we are born. Few studies, however, have the scope to contribute to our understanding of the health impacts of early-life factors and how they resonate across a lifetime. This study will investigate the association between early-life factors and later-life cognitive resilience. Population aging increases the urgency to understand cognitive resilience and identify optimal strategies and windows of opportunity for intervention.

The Nun Study presents a unique opportunity to investigate early-life factors and cognitive resilience, which is defined as the ability to maintain cognitive function despite brain changes that usually cause cognitive impairment. The Nun Study is an internationally recognized study that has amassed data across a century, spanning the lifetime of 678 nuns from early-life childhood and young adulthood through middle adulthood and on to late life and death. The convent archives provide a rich source of early-life data, including academic achievement (e.g., highest level of education, high school grades), languages spoken, and parental education. Autobiographical essays provide information on expression of emotions and written language skills. Annual health assessments, including cognitive testing, are conducted in later life and continue until death when brain pathology is assessed. The variation in early lives of Nun Study participants before entering the convent contrasts with the similarity of their adult lives in the convent, greatly increasing our ability to detect early-life influences on later-life health.

Data across the lifespan have already been collected, and thus this project provides a highly efficient and cost-effective way to expand our understanding of cognitive resilience and its early-life predictors. Innovative statistical analyses will generate evidence to inform public health interventions and public policy targeted in early life to maximize cognitive health throughout the life span."

Even mild cognitive impairment may limit independence (e.g., loss of ability to drive) and reduce quality of life. More severe cognitive decline leads to further losses of independence and increased morbidity, mortality and institutionalization. Understanding factors that put people at risk of developing cognitive impairment is thus important to maintain the quality of life of older adults and reduce health care costs. One such key factor is depression. Depression is a common mood disorder and the leading cause of disability world-wide. 

     We will examine the association between depression and cognition within vulnerable subgroups defined by sex, gender, age and social support in Canadians aged 45 to 85 years using longitudinal data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA). Our team will build upon its previous work with the baseline CLSA data. Longitudinal data will allow us to address issues that could not be addressed previously with the baseline data: 1) temporality (i.e., whether depression precedes cognitive function or vice versa); 2) whether types of social support act as a mechanism through which depression affects cognition (i.e., mediation); and 3) whether factors such as age, sex, and gender influence the strength of the association between depression and cognition, and the mediation of this association by social support. 

     Longitudinally examining different types of social support as mediators within age, sex and gender subgroups will provide new information about the mechanisms linking depression and cognition, and whether social support can exert a protective effect over time in vulnerable subgroups. By contributing to our understanding of the impact of middle and late-life depression on cognition and identifying vulnerable subgroups that may most benefit from intervention, our study will help to improve the health of middle-aged and older Canadians"

The subjects have been followed since childhood and surveyed for a variety of potential influences on drug addiction throughout childhood and into young adulthood. Within the three cohorts we are able to examine environmental, genetic (using a genome wide approach, followed by a detailed examination of specific genes identified, and epigenetic assessments) and biochemical (for amount of drug use and the speed the body gets rid of the drug) predictors as well as their interactions. Of particular note is that among the three cohorts we have extensive data from an intensive study (4 survey's per year throughout youth), assessment of maternal drug use, evaluation in trios (parents and child), twin data sets as well as the ability to compare these results from two environmental settings (ie two countries) and extend into additional cohorts/countries for replication. In addition to outstanding data collection from a wide age range we have the ability to determine genetic variation in both twin pairs and in family groupings, extending our ability to investigate genetic and environmental influences. To complement these genetic and epidemiological approaches we can determine smoking quantity and rates of nicotine inactivation from biomarkers collected at multiple times within the cohorts. This allows biochemical validation of the survey measures, a more robust association with genetic predictors of amount consumed over time, and the ability to use the rate of nicotine inactivation as a predictor of acquisition of smoking behaviours - something we have done successfully on a pilot scale which can now be done in these large and informative longitudinal cohorts."

How migration is experienced and its impact on health outcomes of individuals and groups varies considerably according to the social, economic, cultural, political and environmental conditions within which migration takes place. Aboriginal people in Canada continue to bear a disproportionate burden of ill health, experience poorer socio-economic conditions and are overrepresented in the number of reported HIV/AIDS cases. 
This program of research aims to improve the health and wellbeing of Aboriginal Peoples in Canada through applied migration and HIV intervention research providing an understanding of and identifying solutions to inequities resulting in and from the migration process. In collaboration with Inuit, Métis, and First Nations peoples across 5 provinces/ territories, this program will a) contribute to strengthened HIV prevention efforts among at-risk mobile Aboriginal populations in urban, rural, remote and on-reserve areas; and, b) improve access to culturally appropriate care for Aboriginal peoples living with HIV in communities of their choice.   
This program employs a social determinants of health approach to better understand the origins of disparities resulting in and from the migration process. This understanding is critical to developing appropriate, viable health solutions. By addressing issues of HIV within the context of Aboriginal migration and mobility, this program will determine important triggers that mitigate/reinforce health inequities and disadvantage in the Aboriginal population more generally. Models and findings from this research will undoubtedly have far-reaching significance for Aboriginal health outcomes, system capacity, and other pressing population health issues in Canada."

It is estimated that 170 million people are infected worldwide, and 3 to 4 million persons are newly infected each year. In Canada, and estimated 275,000 are chronically infected with HCV virus. Thus, chronic hepatitis C (CHC) remains a significant health and economic problem in Canada. Yet population-based data regarding HCV incidence rates, prevalence, and patterns of health care use within North America are limited. A Comprehensive Hepatitis C Research Database (CHCRD) had been developed by the applicant by linking records from multiple administrative and public health sources and all HCV-positive residents of the Canadian province of Manitoba were identified during a twelve year period (1991-2002). To date, important data on the prevalence, natural history and health care utilization have been generated from five clinical and administrative databases. The present proposal represents a continuation of this effort wherein the time trends in the incidence rates and prevalence of newly diagnosed HCV infection during two decades since 1991 (the time when laboratory testing for HCV infections became first available) to 2012 will be documented and the epidemiology of CHC on a population level will be further clarified. Furthermore, the outcome of CHC infection and the rates of progression to end-stage liver disease and HCC will be calculated, health care utilization examined, and the observed data will be the basis for the forecast of future health care use."

This research aims to inform initiatives that can reduce health risks among the most affected refugee groups. We have partnered with different organizations committed to refugee health care and wellbeing."
Maternal and infant health associated with maternal country of birth,"['Urquia, Marcelo L']",['N/A'],"['Gender Inequalities', 'Health Services', 'Immigration', 'Infant Health', 'Infant Mortality', 'Maternal Health', 'Vulnerable Populations']",300000.0,268992,"Despite substantial progress in reducing maternal and infant deaths, serious illnesses in the perinatal period are still a big concern for both the mother and her child. Infants who survive serious morbidity around birth may still experience disabilities and other health disorders later in life. Compared to industrialized nations, maternal mortality may be 100 times higher in some developing countries. Female disadvantage is another global problem.   Compared to men, women are at disadvantage in terms of survival and overall health and quality of life in many nations. For example, almost 4 million excess female deaths occur every year, the majority of them in Asia and Africa. About 35% are never born or die at birth, 15% die in early childhood and 33% in their reproductive age. Poor infant, child and maternal health are intimately related as female disadvantage impairs the ability of mothers to take care of themselves and their children. 
Canada increasingly receives immigrants from world regions where maternal mortality and female disadvantage is quite common, such as Asia and Africa. However, little, if any, is known about how female immigrants and their newborns fare, or if the female disadvantage that is known to exist in some countries persist after immigration to Canada. On the other hand, some immigrants may be healthier than the Canadian-born. Learning what make them healthier might be beneficial for the whole population.
To examine these issues, this research program will study 2.6 million births (and their mothers) in the last two decades in Ontario, 500,000 of which were born to immigrant women. I have built a strong research team that will work in collaboration with immigrant community organizations to ensure that our findings translate into more equitable and improved care of mothers and their children."

Canada increasingly receives large numbers of immigrants and refugees from countries where the status of women is lower than that of men. Gender inequities manifest in various health disadvantages for girls and women over the life span across the world. These include female-selective abortions, excess child mortality for girls, poorer quantity and quality of healthcare, dating and intimate partner violence, and fewer opportunities to achieve their full potential compared to males. However, little is known about whether such patterns persist among immigrants settling in Canada and how their health, development and wellbeing are affected. To fill these critical knowledge gaps we will use state-of-the-art methods to analyze rich information obtained by linking multisectoral databases encompassing all immigrants arrived to Manitoba and Ontario in the last three decades and their offspring born in Canada. This research program will generate valuable information to assist with a healthier integration of immigrants to the Canadian society and help advance gender equity initiatives in Canada and beyond. This research program brings together a multidisciplinary and interprofessional team of researchers, government and immigrant community partners who will collaborate to ensure that the research findings translate into improved programs, policies and services for the benefit of children, women and families in the affected minorities and in the population at large."
"A multi-site, prospective risk study of sexual assault perpetration by university men","['Vachon, David']","['Fontaine, Nathalie', ""O'Connor, Roisin M"", 'Wells, Samantha L']","['Perpetration', 'Prospective Risk', 'Sexual Assault', 'University']",558451.0,420238,"At least 1 in 5 women in university will be sexually assaulted. Sexual assault has many immediate and long-term health consequences, including injuries, sexually transmitted infections, pregnancy, depression, substance use, post-traumatic stress, and suicide. Some experts have begun to address this problem by using intensive skill-building programs to help women avoid and resist sexual assault. Some of these programs have been quite successful, but with so many potential victims, such an intensive approach is difficult to fully implement. Furthermore, women should not bear this onus, as sexual assault is ultimately a male responsibility-98% of reported sexual assaults are committed by men. However, because a minority of men commits the majority of sexual assaults, prevention and treatment efforts will be most effective and appropriate when they focus on high-risk men in high-risk situations. Unfortunately, little is known about risk factors for future perpetration of sexual assault on campus. In this multisite study of university men, we seek to identify risk factors related to the perpetration of campus sexual assault, including first-time and repeated assaults. Here, we compare five major risk factors, including (1) deviant sexual interests, (2) psychopathic traits, (3) hostile attitudes towards women, (4) having peers who support sexually aggressive behaviour, and (5) alcohol use in sexual situations. Risk factors that most strongly predict sexual assault will be identified as future targets for prevention and early intervention. Our findings will be published in open access journals and a summary of our findings will be provided to all Canadian universities, sexual assault centres, and Provincial/Territorial Ministries of Education and Health."
Exposure to Ultrafine Particles and Associations with Cardiorespiratory Outcomes,"['Vachon, Julien']",['N/A'],"['Air Pollution', 'Cardiorespiratory Effects', 'Environmental Health', 'Environmental Modelling', 'Land Use Regression', 'Machine Learning', 'Public Health', 'Ultrafine Particles']",105000.0,459113,"In 2015, exposure to ambient fine particles in the air was responsible for 4.2 million deaths globally. Emitted mainly from motor vehicles, ultrafine particles (UFPs), having a smaller diameter, may have a higher potential to induce deleterious health effects than larger particles as they penetrate deeper into the respiratory tract and can reach the bloodstream. However, knowledge about populations' exposure to UFPs, in Canada and worldwide, and their cardiorespiratory effects remains limited. In fact, estimating population exposure is challenging. UFPs are rarely measured at government monitoring stations. Moreover, their concentrations vary widely spatially, temporally and with climate, thus models to estimate UFP concentrations are scarce and their transferability between cities is lacking.

Specific objectives of my thesis include, firstly, to develop and compare the performance and transferability of various models using statistical learning methods in estimating urban UFP concentrations, as opposed to traditional methods. Secondly, estimated UFP concentrations will be linked with health data from population cohorts created from medico-administrative databases to estimate associations with childhood asthma onset and cardiovascular mortality. Finally, I will use the previously estimated associations to compute marginal effects (i.e., number of cases that would be prevented by eliminating UFPs exposure).

My research will provide essential information on the intra-urban variability of UFPs in Canada. In addition, it will provide more accurate tools for modelling UFPs exposure, thereby improving risk estimates from epidemiological studies. Results of my epidemiological analyses will also contribute to the evidence linking UFPs to cardiorespiratory effects. Ultimately, these results will be communicated to public health stakeholders in Quebec and Canada, providing input to update risk assessment documents and air pollution standards to better protect public health."
Global Child; a rights-based approach to enhancing the health and development of Canadian children,"['Vaghri, Ziba']","['Bennett, Susan', 'Clinton, Jean M', 'Durrant, Joan E', 'Greenwood, Margo L', 'Julien, Gilles', 'Tompa, Frank F']","['Accountability', 'Child Health And Development', 'Child Rights', 'Convention On The Rights Of The Child', 'Data Collection', 'Monitoring System', 'Social Policies']",1146751.0,343662,"Recognizing the critical importance of children's environment to their lifelong health and development, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child's (CRC) reporting system is intended to help State Parties to identify and correct weaknesses and deficits in government service that impact children. Canada, though one of the driving forces behind the CRC, has consistently fallen short of the desired level of compliance with and reporting on CRC. While reporting difficulties might be explained by Canada's federal structure, it is also possible that inadequate reports reflect inadequate compliance. A comprehensive monitoring tool can facilitate the compliance and reporting.

This project is intended to help to align Canadian internal processes with our international obligations and commitments to the CRC, by creating a monitoring and accountability tool. We propose creation of the GlobalChild (GC), a comprehensive child rights monitoring platform based on a framework of indicators designed to correlate government policy, implementation structures and processes with children's health and developmental outcomes. In addition to providing a fully contextualised database available to different levels of government and researchers, GC would address consistent weaknesses in Canadian CRC reporting. Ultimately it will provide credible evidence to evaluate existing government service delivery against international standards and to guide the development of more effective policies and procedures. 

Based on our decade of work with the UN Committee, we have developed and tested the ""Early Childhood Rights Indicators"" (ECRI), which is a CRC monitoring tool for children 0-8 years old. We have demonstrated the usefulness of the concept and created international interest in both the ECRI and the possibility of a tool like GC.  We intend to build on this to create GC, a fully digitized, bilingual tool for all children in Canada, paying particular attention to our Indigenous children."

Health is the net result of opportunities for development, education, and participation. Canada is one of 196 signatories to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which has declared such opportunities as human rights for ALL children to enjoy optimal health and development. Yet, in Canada, these opportunities are not provided for all children equitably. As a result there is a pronounced health inequity between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children. Health inequities often stem from discriminatory policies and differential service provision. We have built a team of researchers in child health, development, child rights and Indigenous knowledge and we propose to create Indigenous-GlobalChild (I-GCh), a comprehensive electronic child rights monitoring platform. This platform will be a systematic way to measure the implementation of the CRC by collecting data on the governments' laws, policies and programs in support of each right, and to compare that data to CRC benchmarks to understand how the government is fulfilling its CRC obligations to Indigenous children. We will also consult with Indigenous children (10-17 years), in thirteen regions in Canada, to seek their opinions on their rights, which will then be incorporated into the indicators. Once the I-GCh platform is developed, repeated use will create a remarkable data repository of governments' policies and programs in support of each right. Such a database will help researchers explore different research questions and will assist with evidence-informed policy-making. In the longer term, this can enhance health outcomes of Indigenous children. We will also develop human rights training tools and translate them into several Indigenous languages. These tools will build capacity of children to understand and defend their human rights, while promoting the use of Indigenous languages."

HPV self-testing, which allows women to screen for the virus that causes cervical cancer in their own chosen location and at their own chosen time, has the potential to reduce cervical cancer screening inequalities. Self-testing has recently been incorporated into the Dutch cervical cancer screening program and is being explored in other European countries, but is not currently in mainstream use in Canada.
The overarching goal of this planning project is to explore the challenges faced in the provision of HPV self-testing in current provincial cervical cancer screening program in Canada and begin to lay out a framework for addressing these challenges. The specific objectives of the proposed project are: 
1) to conduct a comprehensive literature review and environmental scan to determine the current state of art related to HPV self-testing in Canada
2) to conduct a series of consultations with key stakeholders such as services providers and policy makers across Canada to seek their views on HPV self-testing
3) to hold a one day think tank session as a medium for knowledge exchange and discussion about our consolidated findings, with a focus on barriers and facilitators to incorporation of HPV self-testing into provincial cervical cancer screening programs, and important next steps from the research and policy perspectives.
This planning exercise will be an important first step in a program of research that has the potential to ultimately significantly impact cervical cancer screening for hard-to-reach women and reduce screening gaps."
Women Empowerment-Cancer Awareness Nexus (WE-CAN): An Implementation Research of Cervical Cancer Prevention through HPV Self-Sampling and Education,"['Vahabi, Mandana']",['N/A'],"['Cervical Cancer Screening', 'Community Based', 'Empowerment', 'Hpv Self-Sampling', 'Implementation Science,', 'Low Income', 'Mixed Methods', 'Rural', 'Sexual Health Education', 'Women']",1052397.0,437147,"With appropriate screening cervical cancer is highly preventable. However, some vulnerable groups of women in India, like those living in rural or impoverished urban areas, continue to be victims of premature deaths. Presently, cervical cancer screening is performed via the Pap test, which requires a visit to a clinician's office.  Self-sampling for HPV, the virus that causes cervical cancer, is an innovative and useful method of screening that allows a woman to test in a space and at a time of her choosing and could overcome many of the barriers to the Pap test like transportation, child care, and cultural modesty. Our goals are to provide sexual health education and to determine the acceptability, uptake and impact of HPV self-sampling on women's health. We will recruit 600 never/under screened women age 25-69 in rural and low income urban areas. We will provide sexual health education sessions to both women and their male partners. The cultural sensitivity and appropriateness of the content of educational materials will be determined through extensive consultation and collaboration with the local communities. To overcome issues related to low literacy we will rely heavily on audiovisual, info graphs, story boards and locally developed plays and videos. We will use a combination of surveys, focus group and interviews to assess the feasibility and impact of the HPV self-sampling and explore barriers and facilitators to cervical cancer screening uptake. The implementation of this proposed novel strategy of HPV self-sampling has the potential to lead to a new screening standard for hard-to-reach women by removing known barriers and offering it as a primary screening test for subsequent Pap testing. Furthermore, HPV self-sampling can be adapted and scaled up to other regions in India and other low- and middle- income countries to advance cancer prevention, community health literacy, public health policies, and enable women to make healthful and personalized decisions."

Immigrants in Canada bear a disproportionate burden of the pandemic. Research shows that more than half of COVID-19 cases in Ontario are among immigrants even though they only comprise a quarter of the population. There are more COVID-19 cases in areas where residents are recent immigrants, living in poverty and unemployed. In addition, immigrants with chronic illnesses also have a higher risk of getting infected and becoming very sick with COVID-19. Among people with chronic illness, those living with cancer or mental health and addiction (MH&A) are also at a higher risk of COVID-19 and worse outcomes. Cancers and cancer treatments weaken the body's immune system, and people with pre-existing MH&A problems experience barriers to health services. Immigrants who have either of these conditions may be at especially high risk of contracting and/or dying from COVID-19. However, there is a lack of research on the risk for these affected groups. Understanding the impact of COVID-19 on immigrants living with these high-risk conditions is critical to develop effective responses to the pandemic. Our study aims to determine 1) if immigrants with a) active cancers or b) MH&A are at higher risk/likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination, diagnosis, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and mortality than non-immigrants with the same conditions, and immigrants and non-immigrants without the same conditions; 2) the role that other sociodemographic and healthcare-related variables play in COVID-19 diagnosis for immigrants with a) active cancers and b) MH&A; and 3) which knowledge translation strategies can promote access to health services during current and future crisis, through Think Tanks with affected communities, service providers and decision makers.

Are we doing more harm?

Yet, couple sex therapy is less effective for them and, even if they are overrepresented in this clinical population, no couple sex therapy has been adapted to better meet the needs of this neglected population. Thus, as an essential first step to develop trauma-focused couple sex therapy, we need to better understand how individuals with a CSA history and their partners experience interventions frequently used in couple sex therapy. The proposed research will use mixed methods to examine the responses and experience of individuals with a CSA history and their partners to two commonly used couple sex therapy interventions: non-genital mindful touch and talking about likes and dislikes. We will also examine whether reporting additional vulnerabilities, namely other childhood maltreatment or intersectional discrimination, is related to worse responses, whether these responses differ along gender identities and expressions, and couples' recommendations to mitigate negative responses and increase acceptability. Couples will come twice to our labs to engage in these two different interventions while being videorecorded. Their heart rate will be monitored continuously and their hormonal reactivity will be assessed. Partners will self-report their positive and negative emotions after each task and their behavioral emotional responses will be automatically coded. Some couples will also take part in individual semi-structured interviews. Results will have clinically relevant implications regarding the safety of these interventions for individuals with a CSA history and directly inform the development of trauma-focused couple interventions to treat sexual difficulties. Overall, results will promote a greater sense of safety for individuals with a CSA history and their partners seeking treatment for sexual difficulties."

The motivation of this work is the underlying belief that peer victimization is an extremely difficult life experience that has lasting and serious negative ramifications in the lives of young people and as such should be stopped (or at least reduced) through intervention and prevention efforts. A review of the scientific research on peer victimization reveals that the introductory paragraphs in much of the published literature include a common script with three key premises: (1) victimization is prevalent in schools, (2) victimization is tied to a host of negative social and emotional adjustment indices, and (3) victimization is largely stable and the consequences of victimization are lasting. There is certainly considerable cross-sectional evidence to support the first two premises. What remains much less clear however, is the question of whether peer victimization and the concurrent correlates of these negative peer experiences are in fact long-term.  The proposed study is unique in that we plan to continue to follow our large cohort (n= 600) of Canadian children as they transition into and out of high school with a focus on the interplay between peer victimization, mental health, and academic achievement. To date, we have collected annual data from participants, their families, and their schools from the time they were in Grade 5 until now, Grade 8.  Using a ""pathways approach"", our multi-disciplinary team has and will continue to examine typical and atypical outcomes as well as divergent pathways by which outcomes are manifested by different children. This research will helps us begin to untangle the complex system of personal attributes, risk and protective factors, conditions, and processes that characterizes the long-term consequences of peer victimization."

Most adult mental health problems begin in childhood and thus reducing the burden of illness in childhood should have a notably positive impact on adult mental health. 

The proposed study focuses on reducing mental health problems by studying one important and often neglected root cause- bullying. Bullying is a systematic abuse of power occurring at an alarming rate, with 35% of Canadian youth reporting being bullied occasionally and 10% reporting being bullied every day. Researchers and clinicians are paying close attention to this problem given evidence pointing to a causal relation between being bullied and subsequent mental health problems that continue long after the abuse has stopped.

In a large cohort (N > 500) of Ontarians assessed yearly from age 10 until age 18, we will examine the long-term impact of bullying on adult mental health by assessing these youth until they are 23. We also examine how bullying in childhood affects two other important areas of their functioning- academic achievement across childhood to adulthood and adult functional outcomes including financial (e.g., keeping a job), social (e.g., early parenthood, peer and family relationships), and legal (e.g., criminal activity) outcomes. 

Establishing the time sequence of bullying and resulting outcomes is critical to help guide clinical intervention and prevention. Without this strong scientific knowledge, we are left with non-systematic and occasionally damaging approaches to prevention and intervention. By examining the chronological sequence between peer victimization and young adult outcomes we will be able to make much needed definitive statements about the long-term impact of bullying that will enable stakeholders to create evidence-based programs, interventions, and knowledge mobilization campaigns."
A tolerated intolerable: A longitudinal examination of youth soccer referee abuse and its impact on health,"['Vaillancourt, Tracy']","['Craig, Wendy M', 'Kerr, Gretchen A', 'Macmillan, Harriet L', 'Webb, Tom']","['Longitudinal', 'Mental Health', 'Physical Health', 'Workplace Abuse', 'Workplace Climate', 'Youth']",944776.0,490000,"In March 2022, a 15-year-old Ontario referee was threatened by an adult in the parking lot following a soccer game that involved him officiating children. This incident is not isolated for youth referees in Canada- 65% of Ontario youth soccer referees report being abused while officiating games. Concerningly, the bulk of this abuse comes from adults. In any other context, this would be called child abuse. In the context of sports, this is referred to as being ""part of the game"", a tolerated intolerable. But how can the above, and what follows, be part of the game?

""On a few occasions, when I coached U8 soccer, often parents would yell swear words from the sidelines, for example ""f*** you ref!"". Considering it was my first time refereeing and the summer I turned 16, it made me feel very insecure making decisions as a ref or in general facing adults"". 

According to the National Association of Sports Officials (NASO, 2017), more than 70% of new referees in all sports leave the job within 3 years. The main cause for this attrition is abuse. Youth competitive sport is the area of most concern (NASO, 2017; Ontario Soccer2019). The glaring issue with youth competitions being the most abusive environment is that youth referees almost exclusively officiate youth games. This means that far too many Canadian youth are being abused by adults in their workplace.

Despite the rampant abuse of referees in sports, we know nothing about the impact of this type of workplace violence on youth. In adults, the evidence supports a link between being abused and poorer mental health. If we look at other areas of abuse directed at youth as a guide on what to expect in this population, the evidence is damning. Being the target of abuse in childhood negatively impacts all aspects of functioning; it has a notable effect on the mental and physical health of youth in the immediate and in the long-term.Our primary aim is to examine the long-term effects of youth referee abuse on health."

Luckily, the medical field is getting better at treating cancer, and as a result the majority of individuals with cancer will be able to survive the disease. However, cancer treatments are usually quite harsh on the body and rarely leave cancer survivors as healthy as they were before being affected by the disease. The future is promising because we now know that exercise can help prevent, manage, or resolve many cancer-related symptoms. Therefore, regular exercise can help survivors regain the levels of health they once experienced before being affected by cancer or even help survivors to get in the best shape of their life. Unfortunately this solution is not that straightforward since people generally don't exercise at all or they have a hard time exercising enough to gain health improvements. Research has discovered many great ways to help make people realize the benefits of exercise and make them want to exercise more, but only half of all individuals who want to exercise actually end up exercising. So there appears to be something else determining whether or not individuals will follow through on their desire to exercise, but we still don't know what these sources of influence are yet. By determining what might influence a large group of cancer survivors who want to exercise to actually become regularly physically active, we may be able to help the many improve their own health. Furthermore, it is important to find ways to intervene on these sources of influence and ultimately make tangible differences on cancer survivors' exercise levels and health. Meeting once per week with cancer survivors who intend on exercising, and providing them with tangible research-based support in guiding their intentions into actual exercise participation, will likely make large differences in the survivors' exercise levels, and thus effectively improve their health."
Travail de nuit et difficultés de sommeil: déterminants psychosociaux et intervention psychologique.,"['Vallieres, Annie']","['Mérette, Chantal', 'Morin, Charles M', 'Morin, Dominique']","['Comportement', 'Professionnels De La Santé', 'Psychosociologie', 'Régions Urbaines', 'Sommeil', 'Traitement', 'Travail De Nuit']",454786.0,322926,"La grande majorité des travailleurs de nuit présente des difficultés de sommeil. De 8 à 25% d'entre eux souffrent du trouble du sommeil associé à leur horaire de travail (THT). Des conséquences négatives importantes, tant pour le travailleur que pour la société, découlent de ce problème; elles sont associées à l'augmentation du risque de dépression, de morbidité et d'ulcères gastriques ainsi qu'à une augmentation de l'absentéisme et du nombre d'accidents au travail. Lorsqu'ils vivent de l'insomnie, les travailleurs de nuit et de jour ont autant de détresse psychologique. Ces difficultés de sommeil s'expliquent principalement par le fait que l'horaire de travail amène les travailleurs de nuit à dormir au moment où leur horloge biologique favorise l'éveil. Cependant, il a été suggéré que des facteurs psychologiques, comme la présence de symptômes dépressifs, ou des facteurs sociaux, tels que la satisfaction au travail, jouent un rôle dans l'évolution de ces difficultés. Notre première étude démontre que 51% des travailleurs de nuit présentent un THT et que très peu reçoivent de l'aide. Cette étude identifie l'importance de l'activation cognitive au moment du coucher et de l'état d'anxiété dans les difficultés de sommeil vécues. L'étude actuelle vise à approfondir la conceptualisation du THT. L'efficacité d'interventions pour le THT sera également étudiée. Le projet étudie le sommeil, l'éveil et l'état sociopsychologique du travailleur de nuit avec ou sans difficulté de sommeil vivant dans diverses régions urbaines. Les résultats attendus fourniront de nouvelles connaissances quant à la compréhension des difficultés de sommeil chez les travailleurs de nuit et offriront une première approche comportementale d'intervention."
Applications of complexity science and network analysis to health behaviour change,"['van Allen, Zack']",['N/A'],"['Behaviour Change', 'Behavioural Science Theory/Methods', 'Complexity Science', 'Health Behaviours', 'Network Analysis']",105000.0,416082,"Four in five Canadian adults have at least one modifiable risk factor for chronic disease (e.g., smoking, inactivity, unhealthy eating). Additionally, the prevalence of Canadians with multiple preventable chronic diseases is increasing, which adds complexity to prevention and management. However, contemporary health and behavioural sciences tend to focus on health behaviours in isolation, failing to capture the dynamic interplay of psychological and environmental factors which influence the multiple behaviours contributing to health outcomes. There is an opportunity and a need to develop theory and methods to better understand how behaviour change is impacted by, and impacts upon, the rest of the activities in daily life, and how characteristics of an individual's behavioural patterns are related to their health and well-being. Despite calls in the literature for advancing our understanding of multiple behaviour change, there have not been major developments in theory or methods and efforts to date have been scattered across the literature. My PhD thesis aims to bring coherence to this literature by applying the principles of complexity science and network analysis to better understand and promote multiple health behaviour change."

Bien que plusieurs recherches démontrent des différences de sexe et d'âge du point de vue épidémiologique, dans l'épisode de la maladie ainsi que dans la réponse aux traitements, les guides de pratiques ne font pas de distinction selon le sexe ni selon l'âge dans les traitements proposés aux patients souffrant de schizophrénie. Les effets secondaires des antipsychotiques sont particulièrement inquiétants, notamment en ce qui a trait au développement du syndrome métabolique, qui semble également être influencé par le sexe. En résumé, de nombreux facteurs semblent pencher vers une différence de réponses aux traitements antipsychotiques entre les hommes et les femmes. De plus, comme les femmes post-ménopausées semblent réagir aux antipsychotiques différemment des autres femmes, des analyses par sexe et âge sont essentielles afin de bien cerner les facteurs agissant sur l'efficacité et la sécurité des antipsychotiques.

While the impact of environmental exposures on children's health is known to be large, the influence on early development is poorly understood. Equally, the influence of interactions between harmful exposures, such as noise and air pollution, and beneficial exposures, such as natural environments (NE, both vegetative, green, or water, blue), has not been investigated before. 
The primary goal with this project is to address this research gap and study relations between various environmental exposures and children's early development and health. We will focus on early life exposures - prenatally, in infancy, and up to age five. We will investigate the impacts of harmful environmental exposures (air pollution and noise) as well as beneficial exposures from NE, including a possible moderating effect of NE on harmful exposures. A sub-goal is to investigate a potentially mitigating effect of NE on socioeconomically related impairments in development. 
The significance of the proposed project is well reflected by a highly urbanized Canadian society with declining early childhood development and increasing socioeconomic inequalities, where knowledge on healthy urban planning is urgently required. The focus on children is specifically chosen in order to provide the highest health impact across the life course and thereby contributing to a healthier Canadian society. 
Results from the project may contribute to solutions to current challenges for early childhood development in terms of rapidly changing living environments, harmful exposures, and stressful lives. We aim to increase the evidence for environmental exposures' relation to early childhood development and thereby support healthy urban planning with targeted environmental interventions for a vulnerable population - children, especially in socioeconomically deprived areas."

The main objective of the Science Travels (La science voyage) program is to address this situation by enhancing the experiences of youth in northern Canada in the areas of sciences, health sciences, medicine, engineering and technology. Science Travels uniquely addresses both of these shortcomings by sending graduate student volunteers, who are actively involved in various fields of research, to engage the youth using specialized workshops for which all materials are brought from the university. Considerable effort is made to design workshops on topics that are relevant to northern communities; eg. nutrition and health, water management, northern ecology and climate change. The educational support to these youth is further facilitated by our online mentoring system. Synapse CIHR Youth Connection program funding would pay for the development of new health sciences activities and the travel expenses associated with the delivery of these activities, enabling us to travel to more remote regions to engage aboriginal youth participants."

Food consumed at restaurants and fast-food outlets accounts for a growing proportion of dietary intake among Canadians. Nutrition labels on food products have become a prominent policy tool for educating consumers and promoting healthy eating habits for pre-packaged foods; however, existing regulations do not apply to foods served in restaurants or fast-food outlets. Canadians currently receive little or no information on the nutritional content of restaurant food and the majority underestimate the calories, fat content, and salt of menu options.
This study will examine the impact of displaying nutritional information on menus. Four food outlets located at the University of Waterloo (2 'sit-down restaurants' and 2 fast-food outlets) have agreed to participate in a naturalistic study of menu labelling. Following a 1-month 'baseline' period, one restaurant and one fast-food outlet will be randomly selected to display calorie information next to each food and beverage item on their menus for a 1-month period, with the remaining 2 outlets serving as controls. Exit surveys will be conducted with 1,320 patrons during the baseline and intervention periods at each of the 4 outlets to examine differences in menu selection and calorie consumption among patrons. Each outlet will provide sales data that will be analysed to examine changes in menu selection between intervention and control outlets over the course of the study.
To our knowledge, this research would be the first study of menu labelling conducted in Canada. The findings from this study have potential to inform new policy measures intended to reduce the prevalence of obesity: the Healthy Eating Act (Bill 156) is currently before the Ontario legislature and would require mandatory calorie labelling on menus, with a number of other jurisdictions actively considering similar legislation."

Parents/guardians completed a demographic questionnaire. Data was analyzed to establish minutes of physical activity and sedentary time as well as to determine if activity levels differed based on children's sex (i.e., male vs. female) and/or attendance in childcare. The results show that on average, male toddlers engaged in more light physical activity (104.91 minutes vs. 90.31 minutes) and less sedentary time (505.92 minutes vs. 507.35 minutes) than female toddlers. Both male and female toddlers participated in zero minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA).

This population has been identified as an important cohort on which to focus, as increased obesity rates can be seen among children as young as 2 years of age, and children, even as young as this, can benefit from daily activity. The childcare environment has been recognized as an ideal venue to intervene, given the large number of children enrolled in this type of care, combined with the recognition that nearly 50% of the variation in preschoolers' PA has been accounted for by the childcare facility. The 2010 Active Healthy Kids Canada report card highlights the need for Canadian data on preschoolers' PA behaviours and recommends the childcare facility as a reasonable site to support PA among this group. This call-to-action sets the stage for future research which may highlight the need to modify current childcare policies to better support preschoolers' PA. As such, the purpose of this study is to assess the influence of the childcare environment on objectively-measured PA levels of preschoolers. Specifically, this study seeks to: 1) assess which attributes within the childcare environment influence PA; 2) compare PA levels between preschoolers attending home- and centre-based childcare facilities; and 3) compare preschoolers' PA levels to the NASPE PA guidelines (recommend 120 minutes of daily PA). Sixteen childcare facilities in London, ON will be recruited to participate (12 home- and 4 centre-based, because of the difference in the number of children attending these facilities). The Environment and Policy Assessment and Observation tool will be used to complete a day-long inventory of each childcare's environment (e.g., PA policies, equipment, play space, etc.) and a document review.

As a result, estimates of HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence among federal prisoners are, respectively, 10 and 30 times the population as a whole - with rates considerably higher for women and Aboriginal people. Among Aboriginal women in federal prisons, for example, over 1 in 10 is reported to be living with HIV and almost 1 in 2 is living with HCV. Whereas Aboriginal people make up only 3.8% of the total Canadian population, they represent approximately 20% of federal prisoners, and are thus disproportionately affected by HIV and the lack of access to clean needles. 

While the Canadian government has thus far been resistant to prison-based needle and syringe programs (PNSPs), a lawsuit undertaken by four HIV organizations and a former prisoner might result in the courts compelling the prison service to make PNSPs available as a public health measure. In order to be effective, however, PNSPs need to be developed and implemented on the basis of scientific research and practice-based evidence. Evaluations of PNSPs have found them to be an important means of reducing the risk of HIV and HCV infection. Outside of Canada, these programs currently work in a variety of institutions (e.g., men's and women's prisons of differing security levels) and have employed different methods of needle distribution (e.g., peer distribution, automatic dispensing machines, distribution by prison staff or outside agencies). 

Prison Health Now, held January 23-25, 2014 at Ryerson University, will bring together national and international stakeholders in the fields of HIV, Aboriginal health, harm reduction, women's health, and prisoner rights to disseminate research, dispel common misconceptions of PNSPs, build new partnerships, and develop practical PNSP guidelines."

Guided by an Aboriginal Advisory Committee, the NA will lead to exciting discoveries and lessons-learned about promising-practices in campaigns to improve the health and safety of Aboriginal sex working communities. It lays the foundation for further research into the complex health needs and social contexts of Aboriginal sex workers in major urban and northern rural areas, exploring how social services, community organizations, reserves, and Elders can function as facilitators or barriers to health equity. A qualitative research approach employing in-depth interviews in combination with an environmental scan of available services is an effective way to investigate how to improve the health of this particular vulnerable community. The findings of such a project will have important implications for the translation of evidence-based research into the development and implementation of public health policies and social practice."

This research project is part of INSTRUCT, the first national-level trial that uses a structural approach to HIV prevention. My research goal is to improve access to government support programs by marginalized young women in Botswana. I investigate individual and system-related obstacles to program access and delivery. As marginalized young women and service providers are deeply familiar with these obstacles and their underlying causes, they are best suited to identify ways to overcome them. They will therefore co-design solutions to improve access to support programs. To facilitate policy change, a summary of the evidence and co-designed solutions will be presented to national policy makers. 
The larger INSTRUCT trial will assess the impact of several structural interventions on HIV prevalence. Implemented by Botswana NGO CIET Trust and the National AIDS Coordinating Agency, INSTRUCT is fully supported by the government of Botswana.

A participatory research intervention of HIV-sensitive social protection in Botswana,"['van der Wal, Ran']",['N/A'],"['Botswana', 'Feminist Theory', 'Hiv Prevention', 'Hiv-Sensitive Social Protection', 'Participatory Research', 'Social Determinants', 'Vulnerable Young Women']",1500.0,400161,"To end AIDS by 2030, UNAIDS Fast Track goal 6 promotes social protection for people at risk of HIV. Poverty and lack of education in Botswana undermine young women's ability to negotiate safe sex. Access to existing social support programs that help young women to return to school, generate income or find employment could increase their negotiation position and reduce their HIV risk. Recent data showed that younger and less educated women who are at highest risk of HIV do not access these programs, however. 
We organized workshops with direct stakeholders: program officers delivering social support programs and vulnerable young women (18-29y; unemployed; out-of-school). Direct stakeholder groups made 14 Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) that indicate why young women do not access social support programs. In 5 deliberative dialogue workshops, stakeholders analyze these barriers; reflect on how to overcome them; and co-design improvement solutions to make social support programs more relevant for young women. The process makes young women part of the solution instead of the problem, empowering them while creating solidarity between them and program officers. FCMs and deliberative dialogue workshops create knowledge adapted to the local context and could generate solutions that may be feasible and acceptable for local stakeholders.  We believe that this participatory approach to local problem solving could help vulnerable young women access social support programs; increase their social and economic participation, and decrease their HIV-risk."

This project seeks to examine the role of material security in improving health for PWUD in British Columbia using mixed methods. This is of critical importance given the current opioid epidemic and may help to uncover innovative ways of preventing drug-related harm and overdose.

Premigration risks for female migrants might include greater exposure to gender violence, economic precarity, and less access to basic rights and healthcare services because of women's lower social position in migrants' origin countries. Childbearing age immigrant women are a unique population in terms of health challenges because of the added vulnerability that occurs during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Research shows that maternal health is particularly poor among immigrants in Canada. Immigrant women have worse self-rated health, more postpartum health complications, and higher rates of perinatal depression than Canadian-born women. Immigrant women also do not consistently have better pregnancy outcomes compared to Canadian-born women. To examine potential health service gaps for childbearing immigrant women, we will use linked administrative and vital statistics databases maintained or created by Statistics Canada to estimate non-delivery antenatal hospitalization rates for immigrants and Canadian-born women. Antenatal hospitalization is a well-established indicator of maternal morbidity. We will also examine the association between mother's country of birth and perinatal health outcomes (preterm birth, stillbirth and infant mortality) to determine if some immigrant subgroups are more susceptible to poor health. Finally, we examine whether gender inequality affects immigrants' perinatal health."

However, it is not clear how to successfully help Canadians improve these lifestyle behaviours at the lowest health care costs. In this project, study participants across Canada will be invited to take part in a 3-month health program (ACCELERATION Program) focusing on improving 4 health behaviours (physical activity, healthy eating, quitting smoking and low to moderate alcohol intake). Upon completion, half of the participants will be invited to join an online social networking program. This online program, accessible through computers and smart phones, will be used to monitor and encourage healthy behaviours. Two profiles of participants will be invited: 1) people considered at high risk for chronic diseases (for example, because they are obese); and 2) 'friends and family' of patients who have suffered a serious medical event (for example, a heart attack). We aim to find out whether the ACCELERATION program is effective at improving the 4 targeted health behaviours identified previously. Specifically, we want to find out whether the online social networking program will help participants sustain positive behaviour changes over time. We also want to find out which participant profile, that is 'people at high risk' or 'friends and family', will show the greatest improvement in health behaviours over time. A total of 3000 participants will be recruited in Halifax, Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver. Participants' health and behaviours will be monitored at 3 time points: before and after the 3-month program, and 6 months after the end of the program. Findings from this study will inform strategies to promote healthy lifestyle behaviours that can prevent chronic diseases among all Canadians."

Mothers, infants, children and families from disadvantaged social, economic and migration backgrounds are more likely to cumulate risk factors, and are less likely to receive routine preventive healthcare, leading to sub-optimal perinatal, infant, and early childhood health outcomes. Social perinatal primary care organizations, such as La Maison Bleue in Montreal, can offset these risks and promote the optimal growth, development and health of infants and children through the provision of adapted, integrated, and multidisciplinary healthcare and services during pregnancy and early childhood. La Maison Bleue operates across 4 sites located in low-income Montreal neighbourhoods each with a team including family physicians, midwives, nurses, social workers, and psychoeducators. Using a strengths-based approach, its mission is to promote the optimal growth, development and wellbeing of mothers, infants, children and families through the provision of prenatal and early childhood healthcare as well as psychosocial evaluations and follow-ups.
Over the past years, in collaboration with the organization's leadership team, a number of research activities have been implemented at La Maison Bleue. However, meaningful engagement with La Maison Bleue end-users (i.e., mothers and families) and healthcare and service providers was not systematically done in the design and implementation of these activities. In order to better understand the needs and priorities in terms of research and quality improvement activities at La Maison Bleue, we will: 1) develop a multi-stakeholder partnership (including end-users and service providers); 2) engage in consultation activities to generate a research agenda for La Maison Bleue; and 3) mobilize participation in a social perinatal community of practice for more effective knowledge dissemination and uptake."

In particular, the way in which residential neighbourhoods are designed can play a role in the development of obesity in children and youth. For example, access to nearby parks and stores that sell healthy foods can affect children's health behaviours such as their diet and physical activity. These health behaviours influence body weight and obesity. However, there is almost no research on whether neighbourhoods can support the adoption of healthy behaviours and improve health and body weight among children who are seeking clinical care for obesity. With more than 1 in 4 children in Canada who have an excess in body weight, a growing number of families are getting care for their children and youth in weight management centres across the country. This study will allow us to know whether the places where children live matter to their success in weight management programs. We will also learn about specific combinations of neighbourhood, program, family and personal characteristics for which children are less likely to respond well to existing weight management programs. Better understanding the role of neighbourhood characteristics on the adoption of healthy behaviours and improvements in health and body weight will provide the knowledge needed to start adapting existing weight management programs to the places where children and youth live."
"The Mental Health of Youth Born at High Birth Weight and Subjected to its Maternal Determinants: A Multi-National Study of Prospective, Longitudinal Cohorts","['Van Lieshout, Ryan J']",['N/A'],"['Birth Weight', 'Child And Adolescent Mental Health', 'Developmental Psychopathology', 'Epidemiology', 'Intrauterine Exposures', 'Maternal Health', 'Prenatal Risk Factors', 'Primary Prevention']",15000.0,185324,"Nearly one in five children suffers from mental illness and 50% of adult psychiatric patients have met diagnostic criteria for such disorders in childhood. Exposure to physiologically stressful environments in the womb can result in high birth weight and influence the development of organs and organ systems in ways that can be lasting or permanent. In fact, babies born at high birth weight may be at increased risk for a number of medical problems later in their lives. Recently, it has been suggested that the environment of the womb can affect brain development in such a way that the offspring of these pregnancies are at increased risk of psychiatric disorders, even when genetic risk is taken into account. 

If the medical problems affecting mothers during pregnancy that increase the risk of having a high birth weight infant (eg. obesity and diabetes) also increase the risk for psychiatric illness in the offspring of these pregnancies, we might be able to prevent or reduce this by treating mothers for such problems prior to or during pregnancy. Such intervention might not only reduce the enormous burden that mental disorders impose on sufferers and their families, but could also lessen the associated costs borne by health care systems and society as a whole. 

The current project seeks to determine if the maternal medical problems that result in high birth weight or if high birth weight itself are associated with particular psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents or if they increase risk broadly. We would like to understand the early life pathways through which this risk is expressed and if these differ between boys and girls. The proposed research will therefore not only identify prenatal targets for prevention, but determine who is at the greatest risk and why, as well as inform how we might reduce the proportion of children born at abnormally high birth weights who go on to develop mental illness later in life."

Previous NAISA meetings have been held at locations throughout the United States-but never in Canada. At least not until this year: June 13-15, 2013 marks the first time that the association's annual meeting will be held here, in our country. As the first international host, the University of Saskatchewan-and Canada more generally-has the opportunity to showcase its excellence in Indigenous studies and research, and to foster partnerships across nations, institutions, and disciplines. NAISA conference delegates come from all corners of the globe: Australia, United States, Mexico, New Zealand, Latin America, Asia, and Europe.

As an interdisciplinary conference, with researchers working in different areas of study, NAISA provides a venue in which health can be looked at from a variety of perspectives. It also offers an opportunity for those from non-health related disciplines to partake in discussions around health and enrich their own research. Historically, NAISA has had a strong health component, addressing everything from obesity and tuberculosis to poverty and the social determinants of health. The information that is shared at NAISA will be used to strengthen national and global relations in health research.

Following the conference, a special issue of the journal Native Studies Review, focused on health research, will be published. In this way, those who are unable to attend the conference will be able to benefit from global research on Indigenous peoples' health and well-being."

The garment industry is a fast paced global industry in which multinational corporations offshore garment production to developing countries. A multitude of ill informed and poorly equipped workers work in hazardous conditions resulting in occupational illnesses. Over 90% of garment workers in the manufacturing sector are females. A majority of these females migrate to cities from rural areas and often lack social support systems and access to primary healthcare. Our research aims to characterize whether health care utilization and the prevalence and severity of barriers to accessing health care differs between female garment workers in comparison to both women in agricultural labour and women in general in India. As well to assess whether women's empowerment indicators such as decision making, access to resources, domestic violence, gender role attitudes etc. differ between these groups. And finally, to research differences and trends in maternal and child health between female garment workers in comparison to both women in agricultural labour and women in general in India over three specific time points from 1992-2006. Since developing countries produce a large majority of the world's textile and clothing exports, the actual social and economic impact that the garment industry can have in the lives of these women and their families is enormous. Therefore, the opportunity to increase their health and well-being should not be dismissed. However, the first step is to accurately describe the current state of health, health care utilization, and the empowerment of female garment workers, which is the overarching objective of our study."

Consequently, despite intentions to uphold principles of fairness, particular groups of people continue to experience inadequate and inequitable treatment in EDs, including Indigenous people, racialized newcomers, people with mental illnesses, facing homelessness, experiencing interpersonal violence or using substances. Stigma and discrimination operating in health care can discourage access to care, result in reliance on EDs, interfere with effective care delivery, and increase human and financial costs. This project will develop a framework for health equity interventions to promote the provision of equity-oriented care (EOC) in Emergency Departments (ED). Through an integrated knowledge translation approach consisting of a three-way collaboration among health researchers, Indigenous leadership and health care leadership we will produce a framework to promote equity for Indigenous people in ED that can be applied beyond the context of ED and beyond promoting equity for Indigenous people. The framework will integrate evidence-based strategies to address stigma and discrimination faced by both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people including that related to racism, gender and heteronormativity, substance use, housing instability, commercial sex work, or mental illnesses. We will work with three EDs in different settings: an inner-city, a large suburban area and a rural serving regional centre to develop, test and refine the framework. This research has great potential to promote equitable health care and health systems, and dramatically improve health outcomes by targeting people who have the greatest health challenges and unmet needs, contributing to repeat ED visits. The research is innovative in its implementation and testing of tailored interventions at an organizational level, leadership structure, and meaningful collaboration across professions and sectors."
Develop Comprehensive Intervention Strategies for TB in Aboriginal Communities Using Mathematical Modeling,"['Varughese, Marie B']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal Health', 'Applied Mathematics', 'Epidemiology', 'Intervention Strategies', 'Mathematical Biology', 'Mathematical Modeling', 'Public Health', 'Transmission', 'Treatment Delay', 'Tuberculosis']",105000.0,229577,"TB incidence in Aboriginal communities is 20 to 50 times higher than that among Canadian-born non-Aboriginal peoples. The high incidence indicates that TB transmission is highly active in these communities. The probability of transmission and chances of new cases is increased if there is a long period between infection and treatment. Social and cultural factors and general lack of access to health care in Aboriginal communities have created a serious treatment delay.  Long treatment delay combined with overcrowded housing and high mobility among reserves creates a real possibility for high transmission. Interventions that reduce treatment delays can have a significant and direct effect on incidence reduction. Mathematical modeling is an effective tool that can qualitatively and quantitatively assess impacts of different intervention strategies and help develop a comprehensive approach to TB control. 

The proposed research aims to: 1) develop mathematical models that help describe and understand TB transmission dynamics in Aboriginal communities; 2) use mathematical models integrated with real data to conduct cost-benefit analyses on potential intervention strategies; and 3) provide recommendations based on model outcomes to policy makers. 

Using mathematical models to address public health issues is an innovative method of approach. The proposed research is highly interdisciplinary and will be carried out in close collaboration with mathematical modellers and public health researchers. We expect the research will provide insight and recommendations for comprehensive TB control strategies for these communities. The interdisciplinary modeling approach developed from this project can be applied to investigate other infectious diseases and public health issues in Aboriginal communities."

However, genetic linkage studies conducted in Western cultures have failed to identify specific chromosomal regions that are significantly linked to male sexual orientation. We plan to recruit participants from a Polynesian island population: Independent Samoa.  Because Samoa is a small island nation, we reason that it will be characterized by lower genetic diversity, which should theoretically facilitate genetic linkage studies. In Samoa, males are socialized into one of two genders (men or fa'afafine), thereby affording us the opportunity to examine how sex and gender interact to influence correlates of male homosexuality such as childhood separation anxiety."

By 2021, individuals aged 65 years or older will make up almost 18% of the Canadian population. Up to 20% of the elderly live with a psychiatric disorder.  Mental illness is associated with a lower physical and emotional health, pain, loss in productivity and mortality.  Many elderly do not receive appropriate treatment for their mental illness and psychological distress and the health consequences to this brings about increased use of services and health system costs.  In view of these demographic trends and the burden associated with mental illness in the elderly, the financing of mental health care for the elderly is an important issue in Canada.  Very few studies, most in the US and Europe, have documented health service use and costs associated with common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety in seniors living in the community. This study will document health care resource use and estimate the per capita excess costs attributable to depression, anxiety, psychotropic drug dependence and the inappropriate prescription of benzodiazepines while taking the health care system and society's perspective.  This will provide essential information to decision makers for planning and budgeting services to achieve a balanced mental health care system (where community and institutions are adequately funded) in order to effectively support all mental health client populations; as well as sensitize the general public as to the risks associated with the inappropriate use of psychotropic medication."
"Why Does Sexual Arousal Encourage Risk Taking? The Association Between Sexual Arousal, Sexual Risk-Taking, and Inhibitory Control.","['Vasquez, Brandon P']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Award'],1753.0,368466,"There are a number of variables that motivate sexual risk taking and can result in HIV transmission. Sexual arousal may be the most common and problematic factor, because it is also a desirable and sought-after element in consensual sexual encounters. Despite its desirable qualities, sexual arousal has been linked with increased sexual risk-taking intentions, decreased self-control, and impaired sexual self-restraint (Skakoon-Sparling, Cramer, & Shuper, 2016; Skakoon-Sparling &Cramer, 2016). The current study looked at how sexual arousal may affect the ability inhibit our natural behaviours and increase risk of HIV transmission. 

Undergraduate students (n=298) were tested on their ability to inhibit automatic responses on a cognitive task at baseline. Participants were randomly assigned to experimental (sexually explicit video clips) and control (non-sexual video clips) conditions. Sexually explicit material was intended to induce a state of sexual arousal. After viewing the video clips, participants completed another assessment of their inhibitory ability.

Individuals who were sexually aroused demonstrated more cognitive impulsivity. The current study demonstrates that sexual arousal can have a negative effect on the ability to inhibit behaviours - a skill that is critically needed during sexual encounters, where individuals must ignore invalid safety cues and instead persist in engaging in risk reduction strategies to protect themselves from HIV transmission. The current results suggest that being unprepared for the effects of sexual arousal on cognitive capacity can increase an individual's risk for engaging in risky sexual behaviour and contracting/transmitting HIV and other sexually transmitted infections."
Our responsibility: healthy welcoming community for newcomer children,"['Vatanparast, Hassanali']",['N/A'],"['Food Secuirty', 'Immgrant', 'Newcomer Children', 'Nutrtion And Health', 'Obesity', 'Refugee', 'Risk Of Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Vitamin D']",2000.0,236965,"The Canadian diverse society has made our nation culturally affluent and progressive. Newcomer families are the fastest growing population in Canada. The health status of newcomer adults declines within a few years after arrival due to adopting the ""Western lifestyle"", such as high consumption of readily available high energy foods and soft drinks, and low level of physical activity.  This adaptation is happening much faster in children than in adults and therefore might pose various health risks for newcomer children. Questions such as, how healthy are newcomer children, how has their nutrition and health status is changed over-time, what are the consequences later in life, and finally, what are the factors affecting the health status of the next generation of Canadians, are very important to raise public awareness.  

Researchers at the U of S in close collaboration with NGOs and governmental organizations have initiated a project ""Healthy Immigrant Children"" with the goal to improve health status of newcomer children. Our data reveal that: overall, 29% of newcomer children were overweight or obese; only 3% were allocated in good category according to the Canadian Healthy Eating Index; none of children reached the level of vitamin D sufficient for multiple health benefits; and more than one-third of immigrant children and half of refugee children spent more than two hours every day on sedentary activities such as watching TV or playing video games. These results indicate the need for awareness and active intervention from families, community, service providers and policy makers to prevent health risks related to unhealthy lifestyle in the next generation of Canadians. 

Hosting a Café Scientifique will provide us with the opportunity to have a very important conversation in an open and informal environment with the public. The audience will share their views with researchers, policy makers and service providers and interact with them in panel discussion."
Calcium and vitamin D intakes of Canadians: vulnerable groups and call to action for improving bone health,"['Vatanparast, Hassanali']","['Whiting, Susan J']","['Calcium', 'Food', 'Osteoporosis', 'Socioeconomic Status', 'Supplement', 'Vitamin D']",91765.0,363325,"Calcium and vitamin D are two important nutrients needed for bone health. Yet, using 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) Cycle 2.2 intake data, we have shown that people do not get enough calcium and vitamin D in their diets. The CCHS data set provided a comprehensive picture on food and nutrient intakes of Canadians. Now, release of the CCHS 2015 data set will allow us to investigate other important issues, such as:

§ The vulnerable groups at-risk of inadequate calcium and vitamin D intake;
§ The major food sources of calcium and vitamin D and changes since 2004;
§ To what extent has calcium supplement use dropped off, if at all;
§ Potential changes in calcium and vitamin D use in those diagnosed with conditions such as osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and cancer;
§ The role of antacids made from calcium carbonate on total calcium intake;
§ How vitamin D intake from food and supplements has changed since 2004;
§ The major supplement sources of calcium and vitamin D;
§ The socioeconomic, geographic, and cultural determinants of supplement use and patterns of use of calcium and vitamin D supplements in people with osteoporosis compared to the general population.
 
  
This project will contribute knowledge for use in policy and practice initiatives that improve and promote bone health, this in partnership with Osteoporosis Canada. We will explore the status and determinants of calcium and vitamin D consumption in Canada, particularly in vulnerable groups; and address the gaps in surveillance by identifying food trends and intake risk factors associated with inadequacy and excess, using both 2004 and 2015 CCHS Nutrition data sets. 

By contributing knowledge for use in initiatives that improve and promote bone health, findings will be particularly relevant to health issues, such as osteoporosis, influenced by socio-economic, geographic, and cultural factors and associated with inadequate calcium and vitamin D intake from food and supplements."

Measuring mental health trajectories in prison: Improving evidence-based policy using electronic medical records and multi-system data linkages,"['Vaughan, Adam']",['N/A'],"['Correctional Populations', 'Health Trajectories', 'Mental Illness', 'Substance Use']",108500.0,387665,"While prisons, jails, and remand centres were never intended to deliver healthcare services, mental illness is between 4-6 times more common in these settings. In Canada, most inmates in correctional facilities will eventually be released back in the community. As a consequence, it is vital to improve the mental healthcare services for incarcerated and released inmates to reduce adverse outcomes such as emergency department use, inpatient hospitalizations, overdose, suicides, premature mortality, and reoffending. This project will use data collected by correctional and health ministries to better understand the nature and quantity of mental illness of persons in jails and prisons. A major pillar to this project is to develop evidence-based policy that ensures a continuum of care as individuals move through the complex web of Canadian health, justice and social systems. The research will explore questions such as whether there is consistency in the identification and diagnosis of mental illness as people move from jails while awaiting trial into the prison system after sentencing, and what factors are related to improving or deteriorating mental health while in prisons. The work will serve as a demonstration of potential for linking existing data that is the responsibility of a mix of provincial/territorial and federal government departments to obtain a more complete picture of the strengths and weaknesses of existing policy from the perspective of individuals who navigate these multiple systems."

While limited research has documented the mental health status of trans and gender variant youth, especially younger adolescents, the evidence suggests this is an extremely vulnerable group. The National Canadian Trans Youth Survey will sample trans and gender variant youth nationwide, recruited through service providers and social networks. Survey questions will assess a broad range of physical and mental health outcomes and related behaviours, primarily drawn from existing national, provincial, and international school-based adolescent health surveys. This will allow direct comparison of trans and gender-variant youths' health and well-being to the rest of the population. I will lead the mental health component of the project. This will involve exploring the relationship between young people's social environments and mental health, including school experiences, family supports, and exposure to discrimination or violence. With a focus on specific mental health issues such as emotional distress, self-harm, suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, this research will identify both health inequities for trans and gender variant young people, as well as environments and experiences that contribute to mental health risk or resilience. Analysis of all of these factors will identify potential intervention points for school and community strategies to improve the mental health and well-being of transgender youth. The results will be taken back to trans youth themselves, as well as academic audiences, and education and public health stakeholders through a variety of knowledge-to-action strategies, and serves as the critical first step in developing policies and programs to promote the mental health of transgender adolescents."

The problem is, while complications are generally the exception and not the rule, they do happen...For the sake of safety, I'd personally choose a hospital."" Perhaps we need a more reliable source than WikiAnswers, but this is where the Tales and Truths emerge. If we ask experts, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists states: ""Choosing to deliver a baby at home...is to place the process of giving birth over the goal of having a healthy baby."" This suggests women who choose home birth are risking their baby's health. In contrast, experts from Britain's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists: ""support home birth in women with uncomplicated pregnancies."" Who should we believe? Why do US and UK obstetricians have opposite opinions? What do Canadian obstetricians think?

This cafe scientifique will discuss the conflicting opinions among maternity care providers about the safety of planned home birth. We will look at the science and examine the evidence and the politics surrounding birth place.

We will discuss what makes a birth place safe, how we measure safety, and what women say about home birth. We will look at the quality of evidence about home birth safety. In particular, we will describe a study that took place here in Vancouver to measure the safety of planned home births, and what Canadian obstetricians think about it.

We hope you will share your experiences and perceptions of home birth, learn about Canadian research, and discuss what the options should be. Canadian health care policy is based on expert opinions and the interests of the public. Have a listen, have a say, and join us for a lively and informative discussion."

Exploring the role of in-school food advertising and adolescent dietary outcomes,"['Velazquez, Cayley E']",['N/A'],"['Dietary Practices', 'Food And Beverage Advertising', 'Multilevel Regression', 'Youth']",165000.0,269309,"The prevalence of obesity and related chronic diseases among Canadian youth has risen significantly over the past several decades, in part because of poor dietary patterns. While many factors influence diet, food and beverage advertising is thought to be important because of its significant association with the food preferences and choices of youth. These associations are not surprising given that many youth lack the necessary cognitive abilities to understand and/or resist the persuasive intent of advertising. To date, minimal research has explored whether associations between food advertising and dietary outcomes extend to settings outside the home, and none have looked at these relations within the context of Canadian schools where youth spend much of their day. Without this information, employing a multi-sectoral approach to reduce the negative impact of advertising on youth is unlikely. The purpose of this proposal is two-fold. First, all in-school food advertising will be documented and described within a sample of Vancouver schools. Second, connections between school-level food advertising and student-level dietary outcomes will be examined. These objectives will be met by developing and piloting a measurement tool and coding protocol to capture all in-school food advertising and by using multilevel statistical methods to analyze existing data from the CIHR-funded Food Practices on School Days Study, a cross-sectional study (n~1,000) that builds on a larger 5-year SSHRC Community University Research Alliance program that was funded to initiate a variety of food system and curricular initiatives in Vancouver Schools (K-12). Research findings will: provide insight into the prevalence of food and beverage advertising within Vancouver schools; help to determine associations between food and beverage advertising and the dietary outcomes of youth; and guide future school-based interventions and/or policy decisions for improving dietary outcomes among youth."

The fertility rates have declined during the last decades, which besides to social changes in desired family sizes and the use of contraceptive methods, may be attributed to the adverse effects of Environmental contaminants. 
The goal of my research is to assess the potential of environmental contaminants to affect human reproduction.  The biological capacity for reproduction is known as fecundity. Fecundity will be measured by the time required for the women to achieve pregnancy. Women's who are unable to conceive within 6 months and within 12 months of trying will be identified and considered to have fecundity impairments. Fecundity impairments have been independently associated with increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes such as low birth weight and preterm birth. 
The primary groups of environmental exposures included in my research are: 1.) Metals, 2.) Plasticizers, surfactants, and flame retardants, 3.) Pesticides and persistent organic pollutants, and 4.) Passive exposure to tobacco smoke. A growing body of the literature suggest these compounds may exert effects on human reproduction; however, definitive data are lacking serving as the impetus for this research project.
My research project will take advantage of the ongoing MIREC national pregnancy cohort study to address this issue.  Preconception exposure to the selected environmental contaminants will be estimated using a proxy measure based on questionnaires and biological measures performed on blood and urine samples obtained in the first trimester of pregnancy.
Knowledge generated in this research project will allow policy makers to formulate sound strategies to reduce potentially harmful chemical exposures to women during their reproductive years."

In fact, women, and not men, are the ones exposed to fertility therapy if treatment is needed to achieve a pregnancy. Although some studies suggest long-term adverse events in women after fertility therapy (e.g cardiovascular diseases, and hormone sensitive cancers), others point to the underlying infertility diagnosis as a greater risk factor. A major limitation of current studies is a lack of comparison between untreated women with infertility to those who received fertility therapy. The GOAL of this workshop is to bring together Canadian and international experts to develop research questions and strategies to better understand the link between infertility and/or fertility therapy and women's long-term health using population-based administrative health datasets."

The population studied will consist of adults aged 18 years or older who are new opioid users at any time during the cohort entry (January 1, 1999 to December 31, 2013). All data will come from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and an associated database, the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). In this proposal, new opioid users are patients who received a first prescription of opioids during the cohort entry, without any recorded opioid prescription in the prior two years. All eligible patients will be followed until a first hospitalization for CAP occurs during the study period, end of registration with the general medical practice, death from any cause, development of any exclusion criteria during follow-up, or end of the study period, whichever comes first. We will identify all cases of CAP and controls free of CAP, occurring during follow-up by searching all episodes of CAP in the HES database. This study will provide the medical community with further evidence on the relationship between immunosuppressive opioids and CAP."

The FNHA is governed by First Nations individuals and communities and has a mandate to reform the way healthcare is delivered to First Nations in BC. An important part of this mandate is to facilitate high-quality data collection and analysis by and for BC First Nations. Toward this end, FNHA took responsibility for implementing the BC portions of the First Nations Regional Health Survey (RHS) and the First Nations Early Childhood, Education, and Employment Survey (REEES). The RHS and REEES are the only survey instruments for First Nations in BC that reflect the First Nation perspectives on health and wellness. Our project is a partnership between FNHA and the Simon Fraser University Faculty of Health Sciences (SFU) to train four Indigenous graduate students who will conduct research for their degrees at SFU while receiving practical training in public health and wellness at FNHA. They will use RHS and REEES data from BC to research causal influences on health topics important to First Nations in BC and other knowledge users. This initiative builds upon the already established partnership between FNHA and SFU to support the mandates of FNHA. The students' will conduct what is termed causal modeling, which is a technique used to identify causes and effects.

Similarly, the global prevalence of obesity has more than doubled since the 1980s, increasing related morbidity and mortality, as well as placing a substantial economic burden on healthcare systems. One potential risk factor for CVD and obesity is food insufficiency. Households lacking financial resources to purchase food may compensate by increasing reliance on cheap, energy-dense, and nutrient-poor foods, a diet which can lead to fat accumulation and metabolic disturbances. Food insufficiency may also affect CVD and obesity risk in other ways, such as by increasing stress, triggering harmful coping behaviors (e.g., smoking), or reducing the ability to effectively manage chronic disease conditions (e.g., diabetes). The aim of this project is to examine longitudinal relationships of food insufficiency with CVD risk and obesity, as well as to identify which factors explain these relationships. To answer this research question, we will analyze 10-years of data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study of black and white adults (n=5155, ages 18-30y at baseline in 1985-6). We will examine several CVD risk factors (blood pressure, fasting cholesterol (total, HDL, LDL), and fasting glucose), summary CVD risk using the Pooled Cohort Equations for estimation of 10-year risk for atherosclerotic CVD, and measures of adiposity (measured BMI, waist circumference). Food insufficiency is a key public health concern in high-income countries. With this research, we aim to identify the mechanism through which food insufficiency impacts obesity and CVD risk in order to develop targeted prevention and intervention strategies. This in turn may improve the health of populations by reducing the burden of obesity and CVD."

My research will evaluate the nutritional quality of the product portfolios of major Canadian packaged food and beverage companies. Specifically, this study will assess the nutritional quality of companies' portfolios at two points in time and in relation to the strength of voluntary commitments made by companies to improve the formulation of their products. This work will also investigate the relationship between the nutritional quality and prices of products in several key food categories, and examine if improvement in product healthfulness is associated with an increase in price. The nutritional composition and prices of products will be determined from a large, highly-representative database of Canadian packaged foods. Overall, this study will provide the first comprehensive evaluation of the nutritional quality of the national food supply, and the relationship between the nutritional composition and prices of foods in Canada. My research will also offer insight into the effectiveness of voluntary company policies, commitments and actions in improving the nutritional quality of foods in Canada. Comparing company practices in the areas of product nutrition and pricing may prompt initiatives to improve the healthfulness and affordability of their products. Lastly, this work will provide a baseline to monitor the effectiveness of policies recently proposed by Health Canada, and inform future government policies to improve the nutritional quality of foods in Canada."

They are associated with increased risk of unemployment, low earnings, welfare receipt and poor mental and physical health outcomes. Given the large costs of disruptive behaviors for individuals and society, it is important to identify children who are at risk as early as possible so that they can be monitored and supported. So far, few studies have identified high-risk behavioral profiles in the general population and examined the impact of these profiles on future economic outcomes. Furthermore, it is unclear what precise mechanisms explain the association between risk profiles in childhood and poor economic outcomes in adulthood (e.g. adolescent delinquency, education underachievement) or what factors in childhood protect against these harmful effects (e.g. consequential parenting, good peer relations). This study will use teacher-rated behavioural assessments from age 6-12 years drawn from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Kindergarten Children (n=3017) and government tax return records from age 18 to 35 years obtained from Statistics Canada, to address four questions: (1) What are the risk profiles at age 6 years that are associated with poor economic outcomes? (2) What is the structure and stability of these risk profiles from age 6-12 years and are they associated with risk profiles at age 6 and with economic outcomes? (3) What social and psychological factors explain the association between risk behavioural profiles at age 6 and poor economic outcomes? (4) What factors protect against the harmful effects of risk profiles at age 6 and poor economic outcomes? Findings will inform the development of prevention programs and policy initiatives designed to reduce the harmful effects of disruptive behaviours on long-term economic and social participation."

I argue that the literary works of Indigenous writers can be read (and listened to) as decolonial acts that promote the revitalization and resurgence of our communities and distinct expressions of Indigenous sovereignty. Utilizing my own interpretation of Indigenous feminisms and an intersectional analytical lens to guide the theoretical approach, this project engages critical discourse analysis to find the connections between queering, governance and resurgence exemplified in case studies of poetry and podcasts of Indigenous women, Two Spirit and queer people. This research has two distinct purposes; one, to prioritize Indigenous ways of knowing, examining artistic and scholarly works of Indigenous gender and sexuality through individual and community expressions of sovereignty that place Indigenous peoples firmly in the present to (re)imagine Indigenous futurities. Secondly, this research interrogates settler colonial structures of and the foundational role that heteropatriarchy and heteronormativity play in perpetuating such colonial power formations. Overall, this research work seeks to engage in a healing process for Indigenous peoples and communities that prioritizes a queering of resurgence as a promising avenue towards Indigenous wellbeing."

This region is characterized by intense natural gas exploitation by hydraulic fracturing known to release contaminants in the environment. We found that exposure to a toxic solvent (benzene) in these women was four times higher than in the Canadian population; in Indigenous women, exposure to this solvent was six times higher. Exposure to toxic heavy metals was also high. This is concerning because exposure to these contaminants during pregnancy could alter fetal development. To better evaluate the exposure to these contaminants and their potential risks during fetal development, we propose to:

1) Characterize exposure to these chemicals in 100 pregnant women residing in Northeastern British Columbia using urine, hair, indoor air, outdoor air, and drinking water samples. 

2) Assess the effect of these chemicals on hormone production during fetal development using in vitro tests. Disruption of hormone production during pregnancy is associated with pregnancy and birth outcomes like pre-eclampsia, small birth weights and pre-term birth.

3) Evaluate associations between natural gas development intensity and exposure levels in pregnant women.

4) Explore social inequities related to exposure to environmental chemicals in Northeastern British Columbia."
Is maternal physiological status associated with dietary intakes of breastfeeding toddlers in Peru?,"['Verney, Allison']",['N/A'],"['24-Hour Dietary Recall', 'Breastfeeding', 'Child Weighing', 'Complementary Feeding', 'Dietary Intakes', 'Feeding Practices', 'Infant Growth', 'Infant Nutrition', 'International Nutrition', 'Lactation']",17500.0,200334,"Throughout the world, malnutrition and poor child feeding practices remain a serious problem in low-income communities. In Peru, roughly 31% of young children are short for their age due to inadequate diets, frequent infections, and many underlying biological, social, economic, and environmental factors. Although the high rates of breastfeeding at 12 months seen in Peru would be expected to be correlated with adequate dietary intake, some studies have reported that toddlers during the second year of life had an increase in mild to severe malnutrition and slowed growth due to lack of complementary feeding. This creates extra concern for toddlers whose mother continues to breastfeed upon becoming pregnant since our research group demonstrated that when a woman breastfed during late pregnancy, the feeding practices, dietary intakes, health, and growth of her infant were compromised.  Without the proper compensation of an increase in complementary food intake dietary intake will suffer for toddlers.

The present study will compare the dietary intake of 12-24 month old breastfed toddlers between pregnant and not pregnant mothers.  The study hypothesis states that there is an expected decrease in breast milk intake in pregnant compared to non-pregnant women, and complementary feeding does not adequately provide the necessarily dietary recommendations for toddlers between the ages of 12-24 months resulting in a lower total energy intake.

Since the first two years of life are one of the most vulnerable times in growth and development, it is important to develop appropriate feeding strategies during this time. If not, the severe implications that accompany malnutrition and improper growth and development will lead to complications in later stages of life such as chronic diseases leading to declining health of the population. By implementing effective infant feeding interventions, child malnutrition rates will decrease and help Peru meet the Millenium Development Goals."
Reducing adolescent psychopathology through improvements in parent emotion regulation and adolescent attachment security,"['Vernon, Julia']",['N/A'],"['Attachment', 'Emotion Regulation', 'Psychopathology', 'Youth']",105000.0,458670,"The prevalence of mental health problems in Canadian youth has surged in the past decade, making youth mental health an urgent public health priority. Secure youth-parent relationships buffer teens from risk. Preliminary evidence suggests that youth whose parents are better able to regulate their emotions are more securely attached, while youth of parents with emotion regulation (ER) difficulties have greater mental health problems. However, it is unknown whether strengthening parent ER improves youth attachment security and mental health. Emerging research shows that reductions in attachment anxiety and avoidance predict reductions in internalizing and externalizing symptoms, respectively. Yet it is unclear whether reductions in specific parental ER difficulties differentially predict changes in dimensions of youth attachment security and psychopathology. 
This study will examine the impact of a trauma-informed and attachment focused parenting intervention (Connect) on parental ER, youth attachment security, and youth internalizing and externalizing symptoms in over 800 families over 18 months.
I hypothesize that (1) ER difficulties will decrease among parents completing Connect; (2) reductions parent emotion dysregulation will predict reductions in attachment anxiety, which will predict reductions in internalizing symptoms; (3) reductions in parental emotion suppression will predict reductions in attachment avoidance, which will predict reductions in externalizing symptoms. I will explore whether the effects are consistent across age, gender, and symptom severity, and test the hypotheses using parent report data and youth self-report data. Completers and intent-to-treat analyses will be performed.
This project will generate new evidence about the impact of a trauma-informed and attachment-based intervention on parents and youth with respect to key mechanisms of change and offer insight into how to refine treatments to best meet the needs of parents and youth."
Extending the methodology for evaluating consistency in networks of interventions using individual patient data,"['Veroniki, Areti Angeliki']",['N/A'],"['Coherence', 'Consistency', 'Individual Patient Data', 'Meta-Epidemiology', 'Mixed Treatment Comparisons', 'Multiple Treatments Meta-Analysis', 'Network Met-Analysis']",140000.0,315656,"Network meta-analysis (NMA) is the only approach to formally compare the efficacy of all available treatments. However, many NMAs fail to account for differences in effects within different groups of individuals such as those who are older or those at different stages of illness. A key assumption in NMA is that trials are sufficiently similar in their design (including patient characteristics), called consistency. A different distribution of an effect modifier (e.g. patient age) across treatment comparisons can cause inconsistency questioning NMA validity. For example, while oral anticoagulants are effective in reducing stroke in all patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, older patients (i.e. >75 years) are at the highest risk of a stroke and achieve greater benefit than patients <75 years. Similarly, this older age group is at a higher risk of bleeding with these agents. These types of analyses are optimally informed by the use of individual patient data (IPD) where data on each patient enrolled in the included trials is combined. NMA is commonly performed with aggregated data (AD) where the summary results of included trials are combined, and the value of IPD in NMA is currently unknown. The IPD NMA can increase power, and identify interactions not detected with AD. However, further research is needed to establish the benefits and properties of IPD in networks of interventions. My objectives are to: 1) establish and advance IPD NMA methods, and 2) make NMA more useful and applicable for clinical practice. My results will be used to answer whether the same treatment effect is applicable to all patients, or whether the treatment effect for patients in population A (e.g. >75 years) is greater than for patients in population B (e.g. < 75 years), or whether intervention 1 is more effective for patients A and intervention 2 is more effective for patients B. My research will inform decision making by providing contextualized information tailored to the patient."

SRs are a powerful tool used in decision-making to optimize patient care, and are being published at an increasing rate, estimated at >10,000/year. Meta-analysis can be part of a SR and is the statistical synthesis of at least 2 trial results.
The Preferred Reporting Items for SRs and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was developed to increase transparency and reproducibility of SRs. PRISMA, published in 2009, was designed for SRs with meta-analyses of healthcare interventions and has been widely used by authors and journals. It is of major importance to report SR methods and results so these methods can be reproduced by others, which can help avoid biased healthcare recommendations and decision-making.
Multiple types of knowledge synthesis exist in the literature with the most common being SRs with network meta-analysis (NMA), rapid reviews (RR) and scoping reviews (ScR). NMAs are meta-analyses in which multiple interventions are compared and ranked according to their efficacy using evidence from entire networks of trials. RRs accelerate the process of conducting a SR through streamlining methods to produce evidence for knowledge users in a resource-efficient manner, typically to meet urgent decision-making timelines. ScRs aim to map the literature on a specific topic and identify key concepts, gaps, and evidence sources to inform future research.
Extensions to the PRISMA 2009 statement have been developed to guide reporting of SRs with NMA and ScRs. Similarly, the PRISMA for RRs has started but was not completed. In 2020, the PRISMA statement was updated to reflect advances in the reporting of SRs. These important advances have yet to be incorporated into the PRISMA for NMA, RR, and ScR, and we aim to improve these reporting tools through this research."
Comparisons of Interventions and their Components for Preventing Falls in Older Adults: A living systematic review and component network meta-analysis,"['Veroniki, Areti Angeliki', 'Tricco, Andrea C']","['Isaranuwatchai, Wanrudee', 'Konstantinidis, Menelaos', 'Moher, David', 'Saadat, Pakeezah', 'Stratton, Catherine S', 'Straus, Sharon E', 'Watt, Jennifer A']","['Component Network Meta-Analysis', 'Fall-Prevention', 'Living Systematic Review', 'Network Meta-Analysis', 'Older Adults', 'Scoping Review']",344250.0,489341,"Falls are the leading cause of injury among those aged 65+ living in Canada: 40% of them experience one or more falls every year. Falls have negative outcomes like chronic pain, reduced mobility, loss of independence, depression, and death. Falls also cause 85% of injury-related hospitalizations among older adults, 95% of all hip fractures, and directly cost Canada's health care systems $2 billion per year. 

The good news is that we can prevent falls. Fall-prevention strategies consist of one or more components, like vision tests, assistive devices for walking, anti-slip footwear, education on falls, exercise, and/or nutrition programs. Healthcare providers recommend component(s) based on evidence from clinical trials that they effectively prevent falls and/or the negative outcomes of falls among older adults with specific sets of characteristics. There are hundreds of clinical trials, and more being done every year. Many trials seek to determine if a fall-prevention strategy is effective by determining if it reduces a single negative outcome of a fall. They do not indicate which component of a fall prevention strategy contributes most to its efficacy or if the underlying component reduces multiple negative outcomes of falls. This lack of evidence makes it challenging to recommend an optimum fall-prevention strategy in older adults. 

Our work will build on statistical methods we previously used to analyze all clinical trials on fall-prevention. We will determine the components of fall-prevention strategies that are effective, which negative outcomes of falls they prevent, and the characteristics of the older adults for whom they are effective. We will update our review every six months to incorporate new clinical trials. Our results will provide up-to-date information on how to best prevent falls in older adults, ensure that recommendations remain current, and guide Canadian and international healthcare providers and policymakers on fall-prevention strategies."
A pilot study to empower parents: Knowledge translation interventions targeting the uptake of pain-relieving strategies during routine childhood immunization injections,"['Versloot, Judith']",['N/A'],"['Children', 'Health Information', 'Immunizations', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Pain Management', 'Parent Education']",71250.0,214678,"Immunization injections are a common source of pain in childhood. Unfortunately, even though previous research has identified a number of strategies that parents can use to reduce children's pain during immunizations, these techniques are not used in practice. Parents are recognized as the primary targets for education regarding healthy child development since they are responsible for all aspects of the care of their child. Parents reported that they are largely unaware of effective pain relieving strategies for immunization and that they would use pain relieving strategies if educated about them. This pilot study will compare three teaching modules to educate parents about strategies they can use to alleviate pain during their child's immunizations. The objective is to determine the optimal strategy to translate knowledge on proven pain management techniques into use in practice. The results of this research will indicate the best way to educate parents and thereby improve pain management for children receiving immunizations. Better pain management during these common procedures will not only reduce children's immediate suffering, but may also avoid long term sequelae that can arise from poorly managed pain during medical procedures, such as needle fears and healthcare avoidance, including non-adherence with immunization schedules."

The Children's Lifestyle and School Performance Study (CLASS) was conducted in 2003 and demonstrated the extent of this concern in Nova Scotia by identifying that 32.9% of grade 5 children were overweight, with 9.9% considered obese. CLASS also shed light on the significance of unhealthy eating and sedentary behaviours of children in Nova Scotia and contributed to the development of recent provincial policies and programs addressing these issues. However, the effectiveness of these policies and programs is not known. We do not know how policies and programs have translated into healthier school practices or if and how this translates into healthy eating and active living behaviours and healthier body weights among children. Knowledge of the effectiveness of policies and programs is important to justify past investments and inform future policy decisions.
The proposed research will collect data and analyze changes related to healthy eating and active living at four different levels: programs and policies by the (1) Provincial Government and (2) among School Boards; (3) school practices; and characteristics of (4) children and families. Qualitative and quantitative methods are proposed to study how Provincial and School Boards policies and programs have affected school practices and to shed light to how changes in policies and practices are related to changes in diet, physical activity and body weights between 2003 (original CLASS observations) and 2011 (proposed data collection). 
The results of this study will demonstrate which policies, programs and practices have been significant in addressing factors related to children's health and health behaviours.

Our team is also involved in implementing large scale interventions to prevent chronic diseases, which provides a unique setting to learn from. It also provides the opportunity to 'use' and 'test' the lessons-learned.
The proposed work has 6 integrated objectives. The team consists of 9 members with diverse backgrounds. Three young, very talented new professors will play an important role in this research and receive mentorship from the more senior applicants. 
Upon completion of the research we will know much more about 1) What policies and programs work; 2) How they work; 3) What investments are needed to achieve healthier eating patterns; 4) Whether children that change to healthier diets also experience benefits in terms of better academic performance; and 5) How poor diet affects blood pressure and blood sugars and eventually leads to chronic diseases.  Lastly, the research program will develop a computer program that can calculate the costs of all kinds of policies and programs that promote healthy eating. This program will also calculate how many cases of chronic disease can be prevented and how much in health care costs can be saved. This will provide decision makers with the information they need to make the best decisions."
Simulation Modelling of the Impact of Population Approaches to Reduce Free Sugar Consumption among Canadians,"['Veugelers, Paul J']","['Hanning, Rhona M', 'Lieffers, Jessica R', 'Loehr, Sarah A', 'Ohinmaa, Arto E', 'Raine, Kim D', 'Storey, Kate E', 'Taylor, Jennifer P', 'Willows, Noreen D']","['Chronic Disease', 'Free Sugars', 'Health Economics', 'Health Policy', 'Nutrition', 'Population Health', 'Simulation Modeling']",,366340,"Canadians consume much more sugar than what is recommended. This is not good for their health. It increases the risk of developing chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes and some forms of cancer. In many other countries the problem of high sugar consumption is the same as in Canada. Some of these countries have taken steps to reduce the consumption of sugar. Canada has not yet done so. There are quite a few things Canada could do. The government could put a tax on sugary foods and drinks, provide economic incentives for low income groups or those who cannot afford a healthy diet, nutrition policies for schools and rec-centers, education, clear label-warnings on sugar content, and many more. We do not know which one of these options would work best. What we propose for this research is to calculate which option works best. The get to this, we propose three steps: 
Step 1: Calculate how much sugar Canadians consume.     
Step 2: Calculate how many Canadian will be developing chronic diseases because of their high sugar consumption, and next calculate how much this costs to provide these Canadians good health care.  
Step 3: Make a list of all kinds of policy options to reduce sugar consumption. For each of these policy options we then will calculate how much less sugar Canadians would consume. We then will calculate how much we would save on costs for health care because fewer Canadians would get sick. 

As such, for every policy option we get a dollar figure representing costs that we will save on health care if that policy option is carried out. Policy makers may find these costs savings very helpful when deciding which policy option to put in place."

Determinants of Sleep Duration and Quality among Overweight/Obese Childbearing Age Women,"['Vézina-Im, Lydi-Anne']",['N/A'],"['Childbearing Age Women', 'Correlates', 'Determinants', 'Gestational Diabetes Mellitus', 'Maternal And Child Health', 'Obesity', 'Overweight', 'Sleep', 'Theory Of Planned Behavior', 'Type 2 Diabetes']",100000.0,338361,"Recently, many studies have found strong links between sleep and both obesity and type 2 diabetes. Since approximately 35% and 50% of Canadian and US childbearing age women are overweight or obese, and pre-pregnancy body mass index is an independent risk factor for gestational diabetes, interventions to promote adequate sleep have been advocated to enhance maternal and fetal health. We know of no published studies on interventions to promote sleep among overweight/obese childbearing age women. Yet, before such interventions can be successfully implemented many questions need to be answered. 1) Which behaviors promote adequate sleep in this population? 2) Which demographic characteristics are associated to sleep in this population? 3) Which psychosocial beliefs must be changed in order to promote adequate sleep in overweight/obese women of childbearing age? Study 1 will answer the first two questions by identifying, in large and representative samples of Canadian and US overweight/obese childbearing age women, demographics and behaviors associated with adequate sleep. Study 2 will answer the last question by identifying, in a sample of overweight/obese childbearing age women, psychosocial determinants of sleep using an extended version of the Theory of Planned Behavior. This theory has already been successfully used to identify the psychosocial determinants of sleep, but all were conducted among undergraduates and sleep was measured with self-reported measures only. In our study, sleep will be assessed using both self-reported and objective measures (wrist actigraphy) to enhance our confidence in the data collected. The two studies will provide foundation for a future intervention to promote sleep among overweight/obese childbearing age women. By promoting adequate sleep (and also weight loss), the intervention would be beneficial for women and their offspring by preventing a multitude of serious lasting health consequences, such as type 2 and gestational diabetes."

It can have serious consequences for the pregnant woman and her unborn child, such as a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. A healthy diet comprised of fruit and vegetable would help prevent gestational diabetes and type 2 diabetes. Unfortunately, the majority of women with a history of gestational diabetes have suboptimal fruit and vegetable intakes. Implementation intentions are a type of psychosocial intervention that provides solutions to common situations that impede the adoption of a given behavior (e.g., time constraints). A recent review of the literature found that this type of intervention is effective to promote healthy eating in the general population. However, it is unknown if implementation intentions would be an effective strategy to promote fruit and vegetable intake in women who are at risk of developing gestational diabetes. In the present study, women were considered at risk for gestational diabetes if they either had a history of gestational diabetes or were overweight. Women were randomly assigned to a group who received the implementation intentions intervention or to another group who did not received this intervention. The study included a follow-up assessment 3 months after the intervention was carried out and the outcomes were fruit and vegetable intake and weight. At the 3-month follow-up women who were exposed to the implementation intentions intervention had significantly increased their fruit and vegetable consumption compared to those not exposed to this intervention. There were no significant changes in weight in the two groups at the 3-month assessment. Implementation intentions can be used to promote fruit and vegetable intake in women at risk for gestational diabetes and thereby prevent future occurrence of gestational diabetes and its serious consequences for women and their babies."
Who attempts suicide? Predicting attempted suicide among a high-risk population engaging in non-suicidal self-injury.,"['Victor, Sarah E']",['N/A'],"['Adolescents', 'Cross-Sectional', 'Emotion', 'Longitudinal', 'Non-Suicidal Self-Injury', 'Risk Assessment', 'Suicide', 'Young Adults']",150000.0,274493,"Suicide and attempted suicide are shockingly prevalent. Suicide is the ninth leading cause of death in Canada, and twenty times as many people attempt suicide as die by suicide each year. Non-suicidal self-injury, such as cutting or burning, is also highly prevalent, with an estimated 15% of Canadian adolescents having engaged in these behaviours. Only in the last few years, however, have researchers begun to understand the relationship between non-suicidal and suicidal self-injury. Engaging in non-suicidal self-injury is associated with a much greater likelihood of attempting suicide; this relationship is stronger, in fact, than the relationship between attempted suicide and depression, hopelessness, and previous suicide attempts. Despite this strong relationship, not all self-injurers will make suicide attempts, and little research has investigated what differs between those who do and do not attempt suicide. This proposed research will clarify how aspects of non-suicidal self-injury, such as the frequency of self-injury, the methods used, or the purpose or function of self-injury, are related to suicide attempts among adolescents and young adults. Participants in this research will provide detailed information about their history of non-suicidal self-injury and attempted suicide to determine which aspects of non-suicidal self-injury are most related to suicide risk. Further, some participants will be followed over time to investigate how earlier non-suicidal self-injury is related to later suicide attempts. This research will clarify the relationship between non-suicidal self-injury and suicide, thereby improving not only the ability of researchers to understand the relationship between suicidal and non-suicidal self-injury, but also the ability of clinicians to assess risk of attempted suicide among the already high-risk population of self-injurers."

In addition, these communities are more likely to develop diabetes-related complications much earlier than other populations.  It is critical to examine the South Asian population because they are the fastest growing immigrant population in Canada.
Many challenges exist in diabetes self-management for South Asian newcomers.  They are more likely to work in low paying, precarious jobs, have little to no social support and experience systemic discrimination.  Structural factors that prevent the adoption of health behaviours include lack of low cost physical activity facilities and lack of culturally tailored and language-specific diabetes education programming.  Religious barriers also play an important role in diabetes self management, such as a belief that God will look after a person's health.  From a cultural perspective, a South Asian diet is rich in fat and carbohydrates, and sweets, which are a significant part of cultural and religious celebrations.  Also, the notion of regular physical activity for preventive health care is not a cultural norm in South Asia.  Our proposed qualitative research using in-depth interviews will shed light on the perceptions of barriers to diabetes self-management among South Asian newcomers.  Twenty-four participants of different South Asian communities will be selected on the basis of gender and faiths such as Hinduism and Islam. The results will provide direction for educational and health promotional strategies to improve diabetes management programs and services.  Given that South Asians will be the most prominent visible minority group in Canada by 2017, efforts must be made to effectively manage diabetes to minimize the burden of chronic disease on the health care system, patients and their families"

While the built environment can positively (or negatively) influence many determinants of health, there are important research gaps for the health impacts of environmental exposures of the built environment.  In particular, few studies have examined the combined impacts of walkability, access to green space, air pollution, and urban noise on mortality. The association between these exposures and mortality may well vary by the socio-demographic profile of individuals or neighborhoods. To address this research gap we will evaluate the association between these environmental exposures among the 2.2 million Canadians who completed the 1991 Long Form Census and whose mortality was ascertained over a nearly 2 decades long follow-up. We will use state of the art methods to assign environmental exposures to these individuals by using satellite imagery, air pollution monitoring, and geospatial surfaces for green spaces and noise.  We will perform similar analyses using data from 4 Canadian Community Health Surveys that have been linked to mortality. Our research team includes researchers at three Canadian University, two federal government department, and external stakeholders. This study will  will produce evidence-based findings to support local initiatives to improve neighborhoods (e.g. community greening) and the health of their residents."
Patterns of mortality and cancer incidence among adults who live near Canadian nuclear power plants: A population-based longitudinal study of CanCHEC participants between 1991 and 2016.,"['Villeneuve, Paul J']","['Goldberg, Mark S', 'Peters, Cheryl E', 'Pinault, Lauren', 'Rainham, Daniel Gareth C', 'Tjepkema, Michael J']","['Canada', 'Cancer', 'Dosimetry', 'Ionizing Radiation', 'Leukemia', 'Longitudinal Study', 'Mortality', 'Nuclear Power Plant', 'Spatial Statistics', 'Thyroid Cancer']",692326.0,420812,"Nuclear power is used in Canada to provide electricity, with its greatest use in Ontario where 61% of the province's electrical generation is from 18 CANDU reactors. Barriers to increased production of nuclear energy include public concern over the intractable nuclear waste disposal problem and about the possible health impacts of low levels of exposure to ionizing radiation. In Canada, 7% of the population lives within 25km from a nuclear power plant. Ionizing radiation is a carcinogen, and has been associated with other health conditions such as cardiovascular disease. There are uncertainties about the health risks at low levels of exposure. While previous reports support the conclusion there are no adverse health effects from living near nuclear power plants (NPPs), these studies have many weaknesses. These include: small study populations, lack of lengthy follow-up, the inability to account for residential mobility, and to control for other disease risk factors. Our study overcomes these limitations. We propose to examine patterns of cancer incidence and mortality among adults who live close the 5 NPPs in Canada. The study population is drawn from those who completed a mandatory long form Canadian Census between 1991 and 2011. The cohort contains data for 13.4 million adults whose place of residence is tracked annually. Cancer diagnoses and cause of death information for each of these individuals through 2015/16 has been determined by linkage to national registry data. We will investigate differences in mortality and cancer rates between those who live near NPPs to those who don't while accounting for other determinants of health. We will also create exposure surfaces that map differences in ionizing radiation around the NPPs, and we will estimate how health risks vary by these exposures. Our findings will provide important evidence about the population health impacts of exposure to ionizing radiation for both the public, and regulatory agencies."
Does residential proximity to natural environments impact the mental health and well-being of participants of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging?,"['Villeneuve, Paul J']","['Crouse, Dan L', 'Dales, Robert E', 'Griffith, Lauren E', 'Hystad, Perry W', 'Raina, Parminder S', 'Rainham, Daniel Gareth C', 'Ross, Nancy']","['Aging', 'Canada', 'Epidemiology', 'Greenness', 'Mental Health', 'Population-Based Survey', 'Sleep', 'Social Determinants Of Health', 'Urban Built Environments', 'Walkability And Active Living Environments']",191251.0,388452,"Over 80% of Canadians live in urban areas, where they may be exposed regularly to traffic congestion, heat islands, and air and noise pollution. Natural features within built environments, including green spaces and views of open water, have the potential to mitigate the adverse effects of these stresses of urban living. For example, measures of green vegetation have been associated with reductions in: negative perceptions of noise, temperatures from urban heat islands, concentrations of air pollution, stress, and mortality rates.  Although previous studies have suggested that exposures to natural environments can benefit levels of well-being, there remains a lack of strong evidence. The goal of this study is to describe the association among Canadian adults between residential exposure to natural environments and indicators of positive well-being (i.e., satisfaction with life, absence of depression and sleep disorders). For this, we will use data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), which is a national-level study of approximately 51,000 Canadians who were aged 45 to 85 years old at baseline. The CLSA includes information on sociodemographic, biological, medical, psychological, social, and economic characteristics. We will use data describing the presence of green vegetation from both an aerial view and from the street view, along with a dataset of water features, around each participant's residential postal code, as estimates of exposure to natural environments. Our results will identify whether older Canadians living in areas with more green and natural spaces around their homes also have better levels of well-being. Our analyses will also take into consideration factors such as age, sex, income, and evidence of clinical depression, season of sampling, retirement status, and social support."
Are day-to-day changes in air pollution and weather associated with suicide?

Emerging evidence suggests that daily changes in outdoor air pollution impacts mental health, and is a risk factor for suicide. These studies have found positive associations between suicide and outdoor air pollution levels. The possible association between air pollution and suicide is controversial because past studies have important limitations. These include inaccuracies in coding suicide as a cause of death, differences in the reporting of suicides by urban\rural areas (which differ in pollution levels), and unaccounted day of week effects that are related to both pollution levels and number of suicides. In addition, previous research has also reported links between suicide and weather characteristics such as temperature and number of daylight hours. These findings are also controversial as they were found to diminish after adjusting for seasonal trends in suicide. Our study proposes to investigate associations between air pollution, weather, and suicide using a study design that overcomes common limitations of previous work. We would analyze associations between day to day changes in air pollution and death from suicide among those who completed the Canadian long form census. Combined, this includes about 13 million adults followed between 1991 and 2017. Among those in the cohort who died from suicide, we will compare daily weather and air pollution concentrations at the time of suicide death to suitable control times. Daily concentrations of air pollution and weather data will be obtained, and linked to the place of death of those who died from suicide. We will also study whether associations between air pollution, weather and suicide vary: by age-group, sex, ethnicity, and socio-demographic status. Finally, we will apply our risk estimates to forecasted changes in extreme heat event to estimate impacts from climate change on suicide risk through to 2100."
Identifying Colombian-based research priorities to investigate through the creation of a Colombian Census Health Cohort,"['Villeneuve, Paul J', 'Rodriguez Villamizar, Laura A']","['Baumgartner, Jill C', 'Ospina, Maria B']","['Census Data', 'Cohort Studies', 'Environmental Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Geospatial Analysis', 'Global Health', 'Occupational Health', 'Record Linkage Studies', 'Sex And Gender', 'Social Determinants Of Health']",20000.0,499747,"We will establish a collaborative initiative between Canada and Colombia to create a Colombian Census Health Cohort. We would bring together government stakeholders and researchers to identify a series of Colombian-based research priorities and develop a plan to create the cohort and the methodology to carry out research. This activity is consistent with CIHR's Strategic Plan to ensure a robust and responsive global health research environment while maximizing global health equity for all.

Canada's expertise in record linkage methodology to create population-based cohorts has informed global public health policies. These cohorts have uncovered links between environmental exposures, occupation, socio-demographic factors and health outcomes. This has included the creation of the Canadian Census Health and Environmental Cohorts. Colombia, with 52 million residents, maintains a series of comprehensive databases that track births, deaths, and illnesses. Unlike most countries, Colombian residents have a unique national identifier, and this allows for the creation of a population-based cohort to investigate determinants of health in a middle-income nation. 

This proposal is motivated due to unsuccessful applications submitted to CIHR Project Grant competition, and reviewers recommendations to better engage researchers in Colombia. As such, this planning grant seeks funding for a 2-day meeting in Bogotá, Colombia. Objectives include fostering collaboration, identifying research priorities that align with Colombia's goals on health determinants. The meeting will strengthen interdisciplinary research between Canadian and Colombian researchers and trainees centered on a newly created Colombian Census Health Cohort.  We will build on existing collaborations between Canadian and Colombian health researchers, including Statistics Canada and DANE, the statistical agencies of the two countries. The research has the potential to evidence-based public health policies in Colombia."
"Occupational exposure to ionizing radiation and the impacts on cancer incidence, and mortality: a record linkage cohort study of nearly one million workers in the Canadian National Dose Registry","['Villeneuve, Paul J']","['Demers, Paul A', 'Do, Minh T', 'Peters, Cheryl E']","['Cancer', 'Cardiovascular Disease', 'Dosimetry', 'Gender And Sex', 'Ionizing Radiation', 'Life Expectancy', 'Longitudinal Study', 'Mortality', 'Occupational Health', 'Record Linkage Study']",558451.0,480070,"All Canadians are exposed to ionizing radiation, whether it be from medical treatments, airplane travel, or the production of nuclear energy. Nearly 160,000 Canadians are exposed to radiation in their workplaces. Many have concerns about the health effects of radiation, because it is known to cause cancer, has been linked to heart disease, and may increase the risk of dementia. There is a lack of knowledge about the health effects at low doses of radiation. This study has been designed to improve our knowledge of how prolonged exposure to radiation increases the risk of cancer or death. 

Our study would analyze data from ~1,000,000 workers in the Canadian National Dose Registry (NDR) whose mortality and cancer history have been determined from record linkage. These workers better represent the types of radiation exposures that Canadians receive than the Japanese atomic bomb survivors that have played a central role in understanding radiation health effects. 

Our specific aims are to characterize the dose-response relationships between ionizing radiation and cancer incidence and life expectancy in Canadian workers. Secondary objectives will evaluate associations between ionizing radiation exposures and specific causes of death and assess sex differences in risk. All objectives will be addressed by analyzing individual-level contained in the NDR. 

No analyses of these outcomes in the NDR have been done in nearly 20 years. This Health Canada registry follows up radiation exposed workers from 1950 onwards. Occupational radiation doses have been collected four times each year. The Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission and Health Canada recently funded Statistics Canada to extend the follow-up of this cohort by 20 years by linking these workers (at an individual level) to Canadian mortality and cancer incidence through 2018. Our findings will provide important evidence about the health impacts of low dose ionizing radiation for both the public, and regulatory agencies."

Most Caribbean countries do not currently have established air pollution monitoring networks in place, and there have been few attempts to characterize spatial variations in pollution. Residents of these nations are exposed to air pollution from a variety of sources including: emissions from vehicles and ships, local industry, bush and waste burning. Moreover, the long range transport of Saharan dust particles has been shown to increase daily concentrations of fine particulate matter pollution. Biomass combustion for cooking is a source of indoor air pollution.  

In 2020, in partnership with researchers at St. George's University, we established a network of low cost sensors to characterize daily variations in ambient fine particulate matter pollution in Grenada. We collected Saharan dust samples to look at the concentrations of endotoxin. This current application is designed to extend these research activities by establishing a  network of researchers across the Caribbean. Funding from this application would support a planning and dissemination meeting in Grenada. The purpose of this meeting is threefold. First, we would engage researchers from other Caribbean nations to expand the monitoring of air pollution in this region. Second, we would identify priorities for future air quality research in the region. These priorities would consider strategies to improve monitoring of air pollution, epidemiological studies to characterize human health risks, and intervention studies to mitigate harms. Third, we would provide training applications of geospatial mapping, and measuring air pollution in indoor and outdoor environments.  

The primary knowledge dissemination product would be a report that summarizes the meeting's proceedings, and outlines future research directions. The meeting will also serve as an impetus for developing a grant application with the aim to secure additional funding."
Environmental exposures in Canadian urban areas and incident breast cancer in young women,"['Villeneuve, Paul J']","['Brook, Jeffrey R', 'Harris, Shelley A', 'Lavigne, Éric']","['Air Pollution', 'Case Control Study', 'Female Breast Cancer', 'Greenness', 'Light At Night', 'Mediation Analyses', 'Social Deteminants Of Health', 'Urban Built Environments', 'Walkability', 'Young Women (Pre-Menopausal Breast Cancer)']",99500.0,467829,"Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in Canadian women, and a leading cause of death in young women. There are several established risk factors for breast cancer including reproductive history, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and diet. Environmental exposures are recognized to play a role on the development of breast cancer, but their impacts are less understood. Emerging evidence suggests that several environmental exposures contribute to sociodemographic disparities in breast cancer incidence. For example, urban areas that are more walkable and provide access to green spaces may contribute to lower breast cancer rates by promoting physical activity. On the other hand, some studies have shown that exposure to traffic-related air pollution, and outdoor light at night increase the risk of breast cancer.  

Our proposed research will study how environmental features of where we live, namely, walkable neighbourhoods, access to green spaces, air pollution, and light at night impact the risk of developing breast cancer in young women. We will address our research objectives using previously collected data from the Ontario Environmental Health Study (OEHS), and environmental exposure data from CANUE that are linkable participants' residential addresses.

The OEHS collected questionnaire data from 216 women diagnosed with breast cancer and 414 healthy controls. These data include information on  breast cancer risk factors including physical activity, alcohol consumption, and reproductive history. We will use statistical models to describe the associations between these environmental exposures and the risk of breast cancer.  We will also evaluate whether these associations vary based on the timing of the exposure, and by sociodemographic status.

Findings from this study will fill knowledge gaps on how environmental exposures in urban areas impact the health of women, and inform urban planning policies and interventions designe to reduce harm."
Disordered eating behaviours in midlife women: what happens during the menopausal transition?,"['Vincent, Coralie']",['N/A'],"['Body Image', 'Determinants Of Health', 'Dietary Disinhibition', 'Dietary Restriction', 'Disordered Eating', 'Eating Behaviours', 'Menopausal Symptoms', 'Menopause', 'Mental Health', ""Women'S Health""]",105000.0,476304,"Menopause is a natural process involving a decrease in estrogen production leading to the end of women's menses and reproductive potential. The menopausal transition is a complex phase of women's lives that is accompanied by a variety of challenges which can affect physical, psychological, and social well-being. During this transition, most women will experience menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, urogenital issues, and more. They will also be more likely to experience mood disorders (e.g., anxiety, depressive symptoms) and physical changes such as weight gain. Hormonal, physical, and psychosocial challenges are known to be risk factors for the development of disordered eating behaviours (e.g., excessive restriction, binge-eating, emotional eating) during other periods of women's lives like puberty, pregnancy, or postpartum. However, few studies on these topics have been conducted in menopausal women, leaving a major knowledge gap in this population. My doctoral project aims to explore the experience of disordered eating behaviours in midlife women during the menopausal transition, as well as some consequences and risk factors of such behaviours in this population. The presence of both overly restrictive or disinhibited eating behaviours in midlife women is of concern as it could accentuate the increase in body fat and decrease in muscle and bone mass typical of the menopausal transition. Considering that nearly 50% of Canadian women are over 40 years old, that menopausal symptoms have a median duration of 7.4 years, and that with a life expectancy of 82 years, most women will spend about one third of their lives in postmenopause, the understanding and optimal management of women's physical and psychological health through this transition is of great importance. Knowledge generated through this project will help guide future research on menopausal women's health and better target their needs in terms of tools and support from health professionals."

Clinical studies have found that ADHD can continue into adulthood and be associated with increased negative social outcomes, including substance abuse, risky driving, poorer health status, although there is controversy about how often these negative outcomes occur and whether they are due to other disorders. Controversy also relates to gender. Among children, boys are 3 to 9 times more likely to be assessed with ADHD compared to girls, while the few adult studies suggest that ADHD rates in men are similar to women. These gender and age differences could be due to differences in symptoms displayed (e.g. inattentive vs. hyperactive/impulsive), diagnosis and acting-out behaviours associated more with ADHD boys. Recent research has highlighted the importance of examining these different symptom domains as they may be associated with different negative social outcomes and the need for different treatments. 
No Canadian studies examining ADHD in the general adult population are available. The proposed study will examine ADHD by adding ADHD questions to the Ontario Monitor, an on-going provincial survey of health and well-being.  Specifically, we will analyze ADHD screening questions, previous diagnosis and medication use by gender and age. Additionally, we will examine whether negative social outcomes are due to ADHD, or other psychiatric problems. Better understanding of adult ADHD by gender and age through a population-based survey can provide evidence of potentially gender-differentiated symptom patterns, outcomes, under-diagnosis and can guide diagnosis and treatment. For example, knowledge on whether the underlying problems are related to ADHD or anxiety would lead to different treatment approaches. Assessment of adult ADHD in a sample of Canadians would also provide important data to regulatory bodies for treatment planning and resource allocation."

My PhD project proposes a systematic search for biomarkers of healthy aging which has the potential to identify biological processes and pathways that are relevant for healthy aging. The basic assumption is that at a given age, healthy individuals are expected to have values closer to an ideal value, than unhealthy individuals for certain phenotypes. Those quantities that vary around an ideal value in human populations would be expected to show what we call a 'Sweet Spot'. Thus, measures that show Sweet Spots can be used to identify some potential biomarkers of healthy aging. We hypothesize that identification of measures for which healthy individuals show less variance than unhealthy individuals can be used as a means to distinguish some phenotypes that are important for healthy aging from others that are not. I will perform a systematic analysis of available phenotype, clinical hematology and clinical blood chemistry report data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) for both magnitude effects and Sweet Spots among individuals with different health levels. There are several ways to define this gradation. We are using four different approaches: a frailty index; total number of chronic conditions; an overall score for physical and cognitive function; and number of conditions that were exclusion criteria in the Super-Seniors study (cancer, cardiovascular disease, major pulmonary disease, diabetes or dementia). For biomarkers that show a Sweet Spot, I will explore possible protective factors that may correlate with the low deviation from the mean. In further research, I will apply the Sweet Spot principle to identify biomarkers of healthy aging in metabolomics data in the Super-Seniors Study and in CLSA."

Of these new immigrants in Canada, many are girls and women born in countries where the practice of female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) has been documented. In all its varying forms, FGM/C is recognized worldwide as a human rights violation. Providing best quality health care and social services to girls and women living with FGM/C is a challenge. Accessing gender-responsive health services can be complex. There is a growing number of Canadian studies demonstrating not only a significant association between FGM/C and various physical, psychological as well as reproductive health complications, but also regarding the quality and respectfulness of care received. Similarly, Canadian healthcare providers report limited knowledge and understanding of how to provide proper and tailored support to women and girls living with FGM/C. Despite these trends of immigration and documented adverse health experiences, we have yet to adequately and respectfully derive the number of Canadian girls and women living with FGM/C. This proposal aims at establishing a baseline on national and provincial prevalence of FGM/C to improve the health and well-being of Canadian girls and women living with FGM/C. Through an indirect approach, we will apply data from the Statistics Canada 2021 Census of population to nationally representative survey samples from 30 countries in which FGM/C is documented. It is expected to ensure access and uptake of resources for Canada through various integrated knowledge translation activities.

Over 90% of SHARP's current clients have had a history of homelessness or unstable housing prior to entering SHARP's residential facilities. Another trend adding to the complexity of the HIV residential service needs is aging; the success of anti-retroviral treatment is allowing PLWHAs to live longer.

The second goal is to determine the extent to which common underlying genetic and-or environmental influences account for the overlap in the development of gambling behaviour and substance use from early to late adolescence. The third goal will be to examine the role of specific environmental factors, notably those related to the family or to the peer group, in explaining the overlap between gambling and substance use. Finally, the fourth goal will be to determine the possible protective role of social norms and school-based prevention programs for adolescents who are at risk for gambling problems or substance abuse. The results of this research will help identify risk and protective factors that are common or specific to the two types of addictive behaviours. These common, or specific, factors should be the main targets of preventive interventions."

To do this, we systematically reviewed the literature to collect relevant data for calculating population attributable fractions (PAFs). A PAF quantifies the possible reduction in new cancer cases that could be achieved if the infection were eliminated. PAFs were calculated for 19 cancer sites linked to infections, and for an additional nine cancer sites where the relationship between the infection and cancer was more recently discovered. We found that the seven infections with exposure in Canada, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis B and C, Helicobacter pylori, human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), human T-cell lymphotropic type 1 (HTLV-1), and human papillomavirus (HPV), were responsible for approximately 6,000 cancer cases representing 3.4% of cancers diagnosed in 2012 in Canada. Among these cancer cases due to infections, 54% were related to HPV, 28% to Helicobacter pylori, 9% to hepatitis B and C, 8% to EBV and the remaining 1% to HHV-8 and HTLV-1. The analysis of newer associations will include hepatitis B and C in bile duct cancer, EBV in stomach cancer, Helicobacter pylori in colorectal cancer, HPV in laryngeal cancer, among others. The current PAF of 3.4% will increase when we include the results of the additional nine infection-cancer site associations. The study findings will assist Canadian public health decision makers in prioritizing interventions that decrease the number of cancers associated with infections."

Walking further to school increases physical activity in a dose-dependent manner,"['Voss, Christine']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,303958,ICS Travel Awards
Combining global positioning systems and accelerometry to identify physical activity 'hotspots' in adolescents residing in downtown Vancouver,"['Voss, Christine']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,324379,"Introduction. Fewer than one in ten Canadian adolescents are sufficiently active to achieve health benefits. We aim to assess adolescents' geo-spatial physical activity behaviours to better understand when and where they are most active.

Methods. Participants were from the only high school in downtown Vancouver (fall 2013; n=31; 14.4 yrs, 38% female). They wore an accelerometer (GT3X+, 1 sec epoch) and GPS (Qstarz, 1 sec epoch) for seven days. Data from the two devices were merged using time-stamps. Using a geographic information system software (ArcGIS 10.1; ESRI), participants' GPS tracks were manually coded. Indoor GPS scatter was coded using land parcels for school and home locations. Trips were assigned a mode based on distance, speed and physical activity (moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), Evenson cut-points >=2296 CPM). We included weekday person-days with >=6 hrs of matched accelerometry/GPS data and >=1 school trip (23% of all person-days). 

Results. Valid days had on average 8.5 hrs of matched data. The majority of captured time was at school (4.1 hrs), followed by home (2.4 hrs) and other locations (1.1 hrs). Twenty-five minutes were spent travelling to/from school, and a further 19.1 minutes to travel elsewhere (for example, walking during lunch breaks). On average, students accrued 51.6 minutes MVPA/day, nearly half of which was achieved at school (21.4 minutes). Despite the relatively short duration spent travelling compared with time spent in other locations, travelling from place to place yielded most of the remaining daily MVPA (school-travel: 11.6 minutes, other travel: 11 minutes). 

Conclusion. Evidently, school is a hotspot for adolescents' physical activity. Travel - which in this sample largely comprised of walking and public transit trips - is also an important source of physical activity. Travel-related physical activity may be less susceptible to age-related declines in physical activity during adolescence."

In recent studies, doxycycline, a commonly used antibiotic, has been tested to prevent bacterial STIs (i.e., prescribed before being tested for the STI), showing evidence of reducing the chance of infection among GBQM and trans women. Despite the growing research, the medical and GBQM and gender diverse communities across Canada will vary in acceptance and willingness to use such preventative treatment. A concern for antimicrobial resistance (AMR) remains, which could make it harder to treat other types of infections. There is little research from other interested parties from the health system (other than doctors) that explore preventative use of doxycycline among GBQM and gender diverse people. Further, the debate about using antibiotics to prevent STIs and concerns for AMR, as well as lack of consistent guidelines to govern prescribing practices, result in a need for more clarity. This is a proposed expanded sub-study of the Engage 2.0 Study, which is a mixed-methods cohort study collecting data from GBQM in Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal. The purpose of the proposed study is to explore GBQM's, gender diverse people's, and health system stakeholders' needs, concerns, and research priorities related to the preventative use of doxycycline. This study involves four phases, including (1) a rapid review and synthesis of the research and guidelines; (2) focus groups with health system stakeholders; (3) interviews with community members; and (4) knowledge mobilization. This study will inform the data collection phases of the Engage 2.0 Study, as well as develop recommendations for future work (e.g., research priorities, policy statements, sexual health programs)."

The research will find and put into action cultural ways to improve wellness. The Group will look at women's wellness related to issues that are taboo in the community.  Women in the community have decided they want to look at ways to improve wellness associated with leaking urine (incontinence) and pelvic organs bulging from the vagina (prolapse).  Both of these are common in women who had lots of pregnancies.  
The Group will hold community workshops, small group discussions and individual interviews to learn how women cope with these issues.  The ideas could be physical, emotional, mental or spiritual, and based on community values and beliefs.  We have found that women have good advice to offer.  They want to share their own experience about taboo topics.  Women who join the research will help develop easy wellness solutions for day-to-day use.
The Sohki Teyhew Group will find ways to share the advice about ways to cope with women's issues.  Possible ways might be self-help wellness groups, simple pamphlets, or holding more workshops.  The advice will be shared in Maskwacis and other communities."

Our Sohki Teyhew Group consists of community members and Elders, community partners and researchers. Since 2014 we have worked on research about aging women's wellness in Maskwacis, a large rural First Nation community in Alberta. 
Our recent research has found that women believe that maintaining and sharing healthy traditional cultural practices (such as preparing and cooking traditional food, gardening and crafts) can improve the health of individuals and the community.  Our planned research will take these ideas forward. 

Research Question:
Can younger First Nations women be encouraged to learn traditional skills from female Maskwacis Elders and does this learning lead to enhanced community engagement, wellness and/or quality of life for Elders and/or younger women? 

Methods:
1.Develop opportunities to exchange cultural knowledge - we shall develop and implement intergenerational community activities and workshops, involving Elders with specific knowledge and expertise about cultural activities and younger women who wish to be introduced/reintroduced to cultural skills. The particular skills will depend on the wishes of potential participants, but may include making traditional food, crafts, and gardening.
2.Evaluation of the impact of workshops - At the start of workshops, Elders and participants will complete questionnaires about wellness, quality of life and community engagement. A year later, they will complete the same questionnaires.  We shall also interview Elders and participants to identify the value of specific cultural activities, and the potential for increasing opportunities for intergenerational activities.  
Expected outcomes: 
This research will build on Sohki Teyhew's experience to reinforce Elders' roles as knowledge keepers, develop alternative ways for younger women to learn traditional skills, and evaluate the effect of the proposed interventions on the quality of life and wellness of Elders and younger women."
A'ekalix-Culture as the Foundation for Wellness: Honouring Indigenous Nursing Knowledge,"['Voyageur, Evelyn']",['N/A'],"['Indigenous Nursing Knowledge', 'Indigenous Research Methodologies']",2500.0,337310,"Culture as the foundation for wellness is about honouring Indigenous nursing knowledge and the result of coming to know and understand our own Indigenous experience.  While working with four Indigenous nurse scholars Lisa Bourque Bearskin, Alice Reid, Madeleine Dion Stout, and Lea Bill we drew on our own Indigenous research approach to glean aspects of our collective experience to attended to the question of how Indigenous knowledge manifests itself in the practices of Indigenous nurses and how it can better serve individuals, families and communities. This research framework centers Indigenous principles, processes, and practical values at the center of the design. It inclusively captures four key components of the entire research process, which are based on Cree/Métis understandings of creating respectful research activities; enacting ethical relationships; being responsible for the gathering, documenting and analyzing the data, and ensuring that mutual reciprocity is honoured. One of the finding from this research study was the notion of culture as wellness. Each of the other themes outlined in the study stem from the four main threads of understanding including roots of being, entanglement of roots, on nursing terms and living the practice. Culture as wellness is stem from the ontological and epistemological of Indigenous knowledge. What was central to this study was that Indigenous knowledge has always been fundamental to the Indigenous nurses' ways of undertaking nursing practice regardless of the systemic and historical barriers faced when providing healthcare for Indigenous peoples. One of outcomes of this research showed many important aspects to building Indigenous knowledge in nursing scholarship such as how nursing education and the delivery of nursing service to Aboriginal communities needs to ensure that local Indigenous peoples and the community knowledge systems are at the core of nursing standards and healthy public policy"
Association between Loneliness and Adverse Medication Use among Canadians,"['Vyas, Manav V', 'Watt, Jennifer A']","['Jones, Aaron T', 'Kapral, Moira K', 'Nicholson, Kathryn', 'Straus, Sharon E', 'Yu, Amy Ying Xin']","['Benzodiazepines', 'Gender', 'Loneliness', 'Opioids', 'Sex']",62750.0,491731,"Polypharmacy, defined as daily use of multiple prescribed medications, has been reported in one in four Canadian older adults (aged 65 years and older), and it is linked to poor health outcomes, including hospitalizations and death. Use of medications such as opioids and benzodiazepines in older adults is increasing, and it remains a concern due to the risk of falls and fractures linked with their use. Reasons for such high rates of polypharmacy and opioid and benzodiazepine use (henceforward referred to as adverse medication use) are not entirely known. Loneliness, defined as a perception of being alone and isolated, affects about one in ten community-dwelling adults in Canada. It is associated with substance use disorder and smoking. Our previous work found that loneliness was associated with an increased with 60% odds of daily use of opioids and benzodiazepines and 20% odds of polypharmacy in older adults (aged 65 years and older). 

This project will build on our prior work by 1) using data as recent as 2018 compared to our previous findings based on data collected in 2008-09, 2) establishing temporality between loneliness and adverse medication use using longitudinal data, and 3) identifying factors associated with adverse medication use among lonely adults to help identify at-risk individuals. The Canadian Longitudinal Study of Aging provides us with the necessary information to answer our research questions, and we have already obtained the necessary approvals to undertake this research. Our team has advanced experience in epidemiological and health services methods. Our work will help healthcare providers to improve screening for loneliness among adults who are on polypharmacy or have high cumulative use of opioids or benzodiazepines. In turn, it will help develop methods to mitigate the effects of loneliness on adverse medication use, along with their attendant health effects."
A Gene-Environment Interaction Model of Theory of Mind Development,"['Wade, Mark']",['N/A'],"['Avpr1a Gene', 'Gene-Environment Interaction', 'Maternal Sensitivity', 'Mediation', 'Moderation', 'Oxtr Gene', 'Psychopathology', 'Social Cognition', 'Theory Of Mind']",105000.0,257562,"Theory of mind is the ability to know that other people act according to mental states (beliefs, desires, emotions, etc.). Children typically show this ability around 4-years-old. However, children with poor theory of mind often experience many problems, including behavioural and social difficulties. Deficits in theory of mind are also a core feature of autism. Thus, it is important to understand what factors contribute to theory of mind so that we can support children's healthy development. In this project, we look at how both genes and children's experiences with their environment influence their theory of mind. Two candidate genes are examined, one from the vasopressin system and one from the oxytocin system. These genes are examined since they have been shown to be important for social interactions that theory of mind is needed for. We also look at how the child's environment affects theory of mind. Specifically, we look at how parenting behaviour early in life impacts theory of mind ability. This environmental factor was chosen since parenting has widely been shown to influence many childhood outcomes, including social, emotional, and academic competencies. In fact, some of my previous research has shown that a mother's level of sensitivity toward her child affects numerous early skills that can be considered precursors to theory of mind, such as cooperation and empathy. Finally, we look at how genes and environments work together to shape theory of mind development. There is now an abundance of research showing that development occurs due to each child's unique combination of genes and experiences. To accomplish this, we investigate gene-environment interaction models, which tell us about the combinations of factors that promote healthy development, and those that may produce poor outcomes. By knowing this, we can develop effective interventions and policies that aim to support children's functioning in everyday life."
Intergenerational transmission of early adversity from mothers to their children: Testing mechanisms in a large Canadian birth cohort,"['Wade, Mark', 'Jenkins, Jennifer M', 'Shah, Prakeshkumar', 'Knight, Julia A', 'Matthews, Stephen G']",['N/A'],"['Adverse Childhood Experiences', 'Birth Cohort', 'Child Outcomes', 'Executive Function', 'Intergenerational Trasmission', 'Mechanisms', 'Socioemotional Processing']",9040.0,491344,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) include a number of negative experiences during childhood and adolescence that are known to increase the risk of poor outcomes later in life. These experiences include things like physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, emotional and material neglect, exposure to intimate partner violence, and socioeconomic disadvantage. A significant literature exists which convincingly shows that individuals with more ACEs are increasingly likely to experience a host of chronic physical health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and metabolic disorders. They are also more likely to experience a range of mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, substance use, and schizophrenia. A much more limited literature suggests that ACEs might be transmitted from parents to their children, wherein parents' own ACEs are associated with poor cognitive, social, emotional, and academic outcomes in their children. How does this transmission of adversity across generational occur? This is the central question guiding this research project, which will use data from a large Canadian epidemiological study to test whether more biomedical complications during pregnancy and around the time of birth (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, low birth weight), as well as more mental health problems among mothers (e.g., depression and anxiety) explain why children whose mothers report more ACEs demonstrate more developmental difficulties over the first five years of life. We will also examine the role of mothers' parenting practices during early childhood in these pathways. By testing these combined pathways, we will be in a better position to understand how mothers' ACEs impact their children, and in turn to develop a set of practice and policy solutions that allow us to tackle this significant public health problem. In doing so, we may be able to stave off the negative impact of ACEs not only on mothers, but on children in the next generation."

Studies have found that an accumulation of negative childhood experiences and childhood maltreatment are linked to many adult mental and physical health problems including cardiovascular diseases.[1] To illustrate the extent of the problem, a 2013 community study in Alberta found that 27% of adults reported some form of child maltreatment and 49% experienced some form of household dysfunction.[2] 

Increasingly recognized as having its roots in childhood, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are leading causes of death among adult Canadians. However, we do not know if, and at what age, we can begin to identify compromises in heart health resulting from negative childhood experiences. As such, we will examine about 500 young adults who previously participated in one of three different research projects examining heart health in the Niagara Region when they were in grades 6 to 8. We will re-examine these young adults to look for preclinical changes in cardiovascular health indices in relation to exposure to negative childhood experiences.

This study will have two objectives. First, it will examine how negative childhood experiences influence cardiovascular health over time. Second, it will examine factors that may account for this connection. Previous findings from one of our studies found an accumulation of these negative experiences to be linked to obesity, waist circumference and heart rate among grade 6 - 8 children but not blood pressure.[3] As previous research links negative childhood experiences to adult cardiac disease, the proposed work would enable us to provide a detailed examination of the onset of preclinical cardiac health concerns and the processes involved."

Although recreational cannabis use in Canada is illegal, 24% of under-25's reported using cannabis in 2013. Canada, however, will soon legalize cannabis use and there are concerns that this may increase use among young people.  Although cannabis use is not associated with the levels of harm that come with tobacco or alcohol, cannabis use at an early age is associated with greater risk of damaging health outcomes. The Canadian Health Minister stated that a primary objective of legalization would be to ""enhance the safety of youth""; however, the existing evidence on the potential effects on young people is mixed. The Canadian policy is therefore one of the best opportunities to assess the impact of cannabis legalization on young people, with important implications for public health policy. 

My dissertation will examine the impact of cannabis legalization on the prevalence and patterns of use of young people in Canada, and US states where cannabis is illegal and where it is decriminalized. Young people will be surveyed at three time points: before implementation and at a 12-month and 24-month follow up. An anticipated outcome is that there will be modest changes in prevalence of use and a modest increase in experimentation, with no significant changes in frequent or problematic use. The study allows for comparisons 'within-Canada' over time, as well as comparisons between Canada and US states where legislation varies. 

The results of the study will contribute to the body of evidence assessing the impact of cannabis legalization on young people and resulting public health policies. Furthermore, this research will be important to other countries reviewing their own cannabis legislation. The Canadian government will review this policy and my research will provide evidence about the impact of cannabis legalization. This is a one-time opportunity to capture a rare snapshot of the implementation of such a radical policy."
Traumatic stress and  Mental Health Impacts  of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Front-Line Workers in Homeless Services,"['Waegemakers Schiff, Jeannette', 'Jones, Alana R']","['Clelland, Steven R', 'Hatfield, Randy', 'MacMaster, Frank P', 'Scharf, Deborah M', 'Schiff, Rebecca', 'Weissman, Eric P']","['Covid-19', 'Front-Line Homeless Services Workers', 'Mental Health Impacts', 'Trauma And Ptsd', ""Woker'S Compensation Claims""]",187556.0,432537,"Lay Abstract: This proposal addresses the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on frontline workers in the homeless sector. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, our research reported high levels of direct traumatic stress among frontline workers. In five previous studies, we surveyed frontline workers in homeless services, in Calgary, Edmonton, AB, and Saint John, NB. Results showed consistently high rates of traumatic stress across all locations, exacerbated by lack of training, inadequate preparation for responses in a pandemic and a perceived lack of physical and psychological safety that could potentiate further primary traumatic stress.  Given the sudden and protracted impact of the COVID-19 virus and the systemic challenges faced in the social services, it is critical to examine how these experiences are impacting frontline workers' mental health and well-being. The overall goal of this research is to document the extent to which the COVID-19 crisis has impacted psychological well-being and work-related disability among frontline workers in the homeless sector. A second aim is to document rates of disability (stress) leave for staff through Workers' Compensation Board claims to further asses the extent of this impact. Finally, we will extend the study to four other Canadian cities.  Together this data will present important information on staff stress, the impact of the COVID-19 virus, resultant disabilities, and possible mitigating factors resulting from organizational changes. Thus, this study would provide understanding of the pandemic's impact on this vital workforce and illuminate any organizational actions that informed mitigating strategies for staff well-being. This is especially critical as health authorities predict a second and possible third wave of infections that would seriously deplete an already highly stressed group of essential workers."

This project represents a unique opportunity to gather essential information about the health of South Asian families and children living in one of Canada's COVID-19 hotspots. We will do this by contacting families from the South Asian Birth cohort (START) study. This is a study of South Asian children and families living in Ontario, Canada. The study collects information at regularly spaced intervals over many years to help understand how diseases such as diabetes and heart disease begin.  The information collected for this project will help us answer three important questions related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on South Asian children and families: 1) What is the impact on the mental health of South Asian children and parents as measured with, and compared to, the Ontario Parent Survey? 2) What are changes in health-related behaviours (e.g., diet, physical activity, screen time and sleep) compared to the previous measures of these behaviours in the START cohort? 3) How are the experiences, facilitators, and barriers to health and wellbeing through the COVID-19 pandemic and recovery efforts encountered by South Asian families?

Grey Tsunami: A narrative ethics argument against the trend of existing ageist word choices,"['Wakabayashi, Ellie']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1000.0,400551,"The Grey Tsunami metaphor is gaining momentum and a Google search returned with 70 million hits with projections to rise even higher in the next couple of years.  This increasingly popular metaphor, and its many variations, is being used to describe the predicted ""apocalyptic"" effects of the aging baby boomer generation.  In addition to popular media, professional registers and organizations have used such metaphors to title their reports. 

I argue that extensive use of such word choices not only propagate ageist sentiments but also cannot be ethically justified.  By invoking - the aging population as a threat to healthcare, economy, and a continued future it deprives the concepts of personhood and citizenship from this highly variable and vulnerable population.  Furthermore, it discourages more holistic and positivistic methods of investing in research for improving palliative care.  
The method I will use is the narrative ethics approach.  I will use three different approaches; 1) narrative ethics as identifying voice, 2) word choice implications for elderly personhood, 3) mimetic content as re-defining citizenship.  I believe this will be most appropriate because it disrupts the stifling of elderly individuals' narratives and individuality.  Framing the elderly as a literal Grey Tsunami compounds more problems than would exist if this population was approached with an optimistic framework.  Metaphors shape the way we think and thinking shapes the way we behave. There is a practical need for more hopeful metaphors to describe aging processes and with it new aging metaphors."

Neighbourhood inequality has been growing in Canadian cities, and in response some local governments are working with neighbourhood residents to find solutions. Comprehensive evaluation of these interventions is required to assess their effectiveness in impacting the social determinants of health in marginalized communities. Neighbourhood Action is a particularly good case to follow because there is considerable buy-in from stakeholders in the process, and the community-oriented approach used here could be a model for other communities. This research will identify the extent to which the intervention is actually achieving its goals, by assessing: whether the specific activities of the neighbourhood plans are being accomplished; what factors impede or enable action on the neighbourhood plans; how ongoing community development work during plan implementation impacting on neighbourhood capacity to create positive change; whether participation in Neighbourhood Action inclusive, and how this shapes implementation; and, if unanticipated changes influence plan implementation. In order to assess the how and when the activities of the neighbourhood plans are being implemented, a progress tracking tool will be used to record progress on planned activities, and key informant interviews and focus groups with key stakeholders will explore the issues in more detail.  Without this information, it is impossible to understand whether outcomes seen (or not seen) are a result of implementation failure, or to assess if and how the community development approach of this project enhanced the enhanced the implementation process.  Evaluation of this intervention will provide timely information to a broad audience in Canada and beyond."

We propose an ongoing process evaluation examining how NAS - a complex, multi-stakeholder population health intervention - moves from planning to implementation, how the intervention changes over time, and the kinds of challenges actors face in achieving their goals. Although neighbourhood-level population health interventions are becoming more prevalent as an approach to tackling health inequalities, few neighbourhood initiatives have been subject to rigorous evaluation, and evidence to guide the implementation of such initiatives is limited. In collaboration with other research, this evaluation contributes to a comprehensive evaluation that will begin to fill this gap in evidence, and will provide needed information to researchers and practitioners.  The proposed research will monitor progress on neighbourhoods' specific actions towards health equity using an ""action tracking"" tool, as well as through key informant interviews, focus groups, and participant observation. This evaluation of the operations and implementation of NAS will be valuable for other cities, organizations, and communities engaged in resident-led, neighbourhood-level population health interventions, and is an important step in strengthening evidence about the impact of these interventions."

While legislation to provide for regulations to govern drinking water and waste water treatment in First Nations communities appears to be a step forward, imposing regulations without providing adequate training and resources to meet regulatory requirements places at risk the safety of drinking water, the promotion of health, and health equity in First Nations communities. This project will develop baseline information on important issues related to drinking water access and safety in First Nations communities. These baseline data will be used to provide essential information to guide the development of First Nations water regulation, to evaluate the potential effectiveness and the need for implementation of Bill S-11, and ultimately the promotion of health equity for members of First Nations communities."

In high-income countries (HICs), the use of self-care models has led to a decline in HF prevalence. However, these improvements are less evident in low-and-middle-income countries (LMICs) and marginalized subgroup populations in HICs, like the Indigenous. HF is a complex condition and requires the combined expertise of specialists and primary care physicians, yet marginalized populations often live in remote areas with limited access to any source of care. To help minimize these health disparities, digital health has been offered as a tool to improve access to HF care. However, as the majority of digital tools have been designed for use in HICs, there is concern if they will be effective in these populations, since their health outcomes are strongly rooted with their cultural context. To support HF care in these populations, there is a need to understand the context-specific factors influencing their health outcomes. University Health Network has displayed the effectiveness of their Medly Program, which allows patients to manage their HF through their mobile phone. With this, my research aims to work in partnership with the Uganda Heart Institute in Kampala, and three Aboriginal Health Access Centres in Northern Ontario, to adapt Medly for the LMIC and Indigenous contexts. As the project lead, I will interview patients and clinicians to investigate their views on the factors affecting HF outcomes. This feedback will be used to adapt Medly for the LMIC and Indigenous contexts. Usability testing will then be held to evaluate the adapted systems effectiveness. Finally, results from all phases will be used to conduct a comparative case analysis to differentiate the impact of context between the LMIC and Indigenous systems. Ultimately, this study will support improved access to HF care in marginalized populations and will serve as model to design tools for settings with limited resources."
"Environmental Exposures, Helicobacter pylori Infection and Gastritis in Canadian Arctic Communities","['Walker, Emily V']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal Health', 'Environmental Health', 'Gastritis', 'Helicobacter Pylori']",945.0,288360,"Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) are bacteria that infect the lining of the stomach. H.pylori is found all over the world, but some populations are more affected by the infection and related disease than others. Initial infection typically occurs during childhood and can persist life-long in the absence of treatment. Chronic infection is associated with inflammation of the stomach lining and rarely serious stomach disease, including peptic ulcers and stomach cancer. This research examines the role of the environment in transmission of H.pylori and development of related disease in Canadian Arctic communities, where 58-70% of tested residents have the infection. 
Residents if Aklavik, NT and Tuktoyaktuk, NT took part in a community-based research project on H.pylori infection in 2007 and 2011, respectively. Participants were tested for the infection and data on demographics, medical history and frequency of exposure to environmental sources were collected through structured interviews. Stomach biopsies were obtained in 2008 in Aklavik and examined through a microscope for signs of inflammation, graded as none, mild, moderate or severe. The frequencies of the infection and severe inflammation were compared between people who were and were not exposed to environmental sources using statistical models.  
Results indicate that the infection does not occur more frequently in individuals exposed to environmental sources that could potentially be contaminated with the bacteria, relative to participants who were not exposed to these sources. This includes environmental exposures such as untreated water, sewage, cats and dogs. Preliminary analysis of the effect of exposure to mice indicates that prevalence of H.pylori infection is higher in individuals who reported having mice in their home, relative to those who are not exposed to mice. This analysis also provided evidence of a possible link between untreated water consumption and prevalence of severe gastritis."

In the context of the overdose crisis there is an urgent need to inform the implementation and scale-up of harm reduction services and their effective integration within health, housing and support programs and services. While the effectiveness of harm reduction services has been shown in certain contexts, much less is known about how to implement comprehensive equity-oriented approaches in diverse contexts, and the impacts of these approaches. Equity-oriented approaches attempt to lessen the potential harms that can occur when people experience stigma and discrimination when accessing services. Researchers on this proposal collaborated on the development of a social justice and health equity framework known as EQUIP to foster equity-oriented interventions in primary healthcare. The EQUIP framework and interventions are based on four interconnected dimensions of equity-oriented care (trauma and violence informed care, culturally safe care, contextually tailored care, and harm-reduction) and 10 strategies to guide organizations in enhancing their capacity to provide equity-oriented services. This proposal builds on this research and engages collaborators implementing harm reduction programs and services in Victoria BC. The purpose of this planning grant is to translate our existing equity-oriented framework to inform the development of equity-oriented harm reduction interventions which can be tailored to improve policies and practices regarding illicit substance use and opioid overdose in Victoria BC. Specifically, we will engage local stakeholders in a two-day meeting to determine key issues and research gaps and build local capacity for implementing equity oriented harm reduction strategies.

Despite this declaration, 780 million people remain without access to improved sources of drinking water, with 653 million of them living in rural areas; and 2.5 billion are still without improved sanitation. WaSH (water supply, sanitation and hygiene) problems are especially acute in low and middle income countries (LMICs), which often lack the financial, human, and infrastructure resources to deal with the problems of providing enough drinking water of sufficient quality and appropriate sanitation/wastewater treatment alternatives. WaSH access has direct impacts on health. Poor water and sanitation can lead to several common health problems in vulnerable populations that can be life threatening and/or chronically debilitating. In high income countries (HICs), rural communities often experience parallel difficulties. In 2008 more than 1700 boil water advisories were in effect across Canada and as of December 31st, 2012 there were 117 First Nation communities under a Drinking Water Advisory. Moreover, Aboriginal populations are reported to have lower life expectancy and higher disease burdens than the general Canadian population. There is a need, both in Canada and globally, to address the problem of inadequate WaSH in rural, remote and otherwise marginalized communities to improve health and well-being. These complex problems require a concerted trans-sectoral and transnational response, employing integrated transdisciplinary approaches. The proposed event will bring together water and health experts from S.E. Asia, Africa and Canada to explore a different and transformative approach to integrating research, policy and practice as it applies to the WaSH crisis. The ultimate goal of the event is to develop a network of researchers, practitioners and policy makers to address what has become a ""wicked"" problem."

Nowhere is the threat greater than for Indigenous communities. Impacts of climate change are being felt through changes in wildlife patterns, sea ice and permafrost extents, and rainfall and snowfall timing and amounts. Given close ties to the land, these changes impact significantly upon the health and wellbeing of Indigenous populations in Canada and abroad. Indeed, such close interaction with and dependence upon the land and the environment significantly increase vulnerability, especially in terms of health and wellbeing. Superimposed upon this, changing weather patterns pose increased risk for outbreaks of waterborne disease, especially in communities where the multiple barriers for safe water protection are not securely in place. The goal of the proposed initiative is to improve the capacity of Indigenous populations to protect and promote the quality of drinking water in their communities in an holistic manner, balancing sustainable economic growth, environmental integrity, and cultural identity in a model for future green economies. 
Building upon community water self-assessments, online resources, and community-based monitoring initiatives, this initiative supports local ownership of knowledge, planning, and policy interventions for source water protection and sustainable water management through development of tools designed a) for use in data poor regions, and b) for strengthening of community partnerships with sectors and stakeholders (horizontal and vertical).

A recent report indicated that 30% of First Nations children, 11% of Metis children, and 3% of all other Manitoba children were in the care of CPS at some point before their 18th birthday. Whether parents' health impacts such separation, and how this separation impacts parents' health is not well understood. 
Over the past few years, we have worked with community partners to identify questions that would be most useful in improving the wellbeing of families involved with CPS. The first step is to understand the scope of the issue; to do this, we will describe how many parents are involved with CPS, and how they move through the system. Next, we will look at whether parents with specific health conditions are more likely to have a child placed in the care of CPS and whether losing custody of a child affects parents' health. These relationships will first be examined for parents losing temporary custody of a child to CPS. Among parents who lost temporary custody, we will then examine these relationships for parents who lost permanent custody of their child to CPS.
Ongoing colonialism and intergenerational family separation among Indigenous peoples may be experienced differently by First Nation and Metis families. Therefore, we will look at each research question separately for three groups of parents: First Nation, Metis, and all other Manitoban parents. Questions will be answered using population-based administrative data for all parents who had a child born in Manitoba from 1998 to 2020. Findings will inform equity-based and community-led interventions to address the unique health challenges of parents involved with CPS to reduce family separation and shorten the time to reunification among separated families."

Emergency education is regularly offered in elementary schools through regional police school visits.  However, school-based emergency education largely focuses on the use of landline phones and does not adequately reflect today's digital technology.  Our research took children through a simulated emergency scenario to evaluate whether children know how to use a smartphone to call 9-1-1 in an emergency.  The results of our research showed that only 17% of children in junior kindergarten to grade three who recognized the situation as an emergency were able to call 9-1-1 on a smartphone.  Additionally, we identified the specific tasks that prevented children from successfully calling 9-1-1.  These included pushing the 'emergency' button to bypass a locked screen and pushing the 'call' button after dialing 9-1-1 to initiate the call, both of which are unique features of dialing 9-1-1 on a smartphone and are vital steps to making an emergency call.  This study highlighted the need to develop emergency skills education aimed at enhancing children's emergency preparedness in today's digital era.  As an immediate and widely accessible solution to this problem, we developed the child-friendly video, ""When & How to Call 911"" (available in both English and French).  This video reviews how to call 9-1-1 on a smartphone, as well as the various other types of phones children are exposed to today, and specifically teaches the steps that many children in our study had difficulty with, in order to address this knowledge gap.  We hope this video is a valuable resource for emergency education that can be used widely by schools, police agencies, community organizations, and parents and caregivers to prepare children to effectively respond to emergencies in today's digital era."

Research suggests that more than half (approximately 64%) of Canadian children are inactive. Despite the well documented benefits of leading a healthy, active lifestyle (e.g., increased self-esteem), research suggests that engagement in physical activity declines during adolescence. Reasons for this decline include lacking the motivation to initiate physical activity and an inability to overcome obstacles preventing activity. To address our youth's inactive lifestyles, it is important to identify strategies which will increase the exercise behaviors of children and youth.  For example, for adults, imagery (i.e., creating or recreating experiences in one's mind), and self-efficacy beliefs (i.e., the confidence associated with executing a specific behaviour), play an important role in whether or not someone engages in exercise.  However, it is unknown whether these same psychological processes apply to younger populations. The current research seeks to examine the specific strategies involved in young people beginning and maintaining physically active lifestyles."

One of the severe consequences of having MDE is suicide. US workers with depression cost an estimated US $44.01 billion per year in lost productivity. Because of its significant impact on employee health and productivity, MDE in the workplace has drawn considerable attention from governments, business community, health, research and NGOs. Nevertheless, the progress of prevention of workplace MDE has been sub-optimal, which may be due to many factors, including: 1) lack of effective, acceptable and sustainable prevention strategies, and 2) insufficient involvement from relevant stakeholders such as employers and employees. 

E-mental health solutions are a promising approach for addressing MDE in workplaces.

The impact of coach-guided risk communication on the risk of major depression: A randomized controlled trial,"['Wang, JianLi']","['Feng, Cindy Xin', 'Hajizadeh, Mohammad', 'Lesage, Alain D']","['Depression', 'Early Prevention', 'Longitudinal Study', 'Risk Communication', 'Self-Help']",856801.0,488636,"Depression is a highly prevalent and disabling mental health problem. One way of preventing depression is to stop it before it happens through effective self-management. Working with potential users, we developed a coach-guided, personalized depression risk communication tool (PDRC) for sharing information about individualized depression risk, risk profile (risk factors present), potential risk reduction and evidence-based self-help strategies. We anticipate that the PDRC will greatly motivate users to actively engage in self-help and help-seeking, leading to a reduced risk of depression. The proposed study will recruit 500 male and 500 female adults who are at high risk of having depression across Canada, and randomly allocate them into the intervention and control groups. They will be followed for 12 months. The data of the trial will allow us to answer the questions: (1) Can the coach-guided PDRC reduce the risk of depression? (2) Does the intervention motivate people to actively engage in evidence-based self-help and help-seeking behaviors? (3) For whom the intervention works best? and (4) what are the costs and potential savings associated with the intervention? If successful, this project will offer a novel and effective tool for early prevention of major depression in the Canadian general population, help us understand how it works and the cost-effectiveness of implementing such a tool in the community from the economic perspective."
Planning and co-designing a school-based longitudinal study on student mental health in China,"['Wang, JianLi', 'LIU, YAN']","['Georgiades, Katholiki K', 'Lesage, Alain D']","['Co-Design', 'Mental Health Problems', 'Planning Activities', 'School-Based Study', 'Students']",20000.0,499811,"Globally, epidemiological studies have unveiled a broad spectrum, with the prevalence of mental disorders in children and adolescents ranging from 3.5% to 38.3%. In the context of China, cross-sectional surveys and media reports have pointed to an upward trend in the prevalence of mental health problems and suicide behaviors among students and young adults. Despite these alarming observations, there are no longitudinal studies in China that explore the incidence of mental health problems, suicide behaviors, associated health determinants, mental health services utilization, and notably, the equity in student mental health and service access. 

Recognizing this knowledge gap as a barrier to effective intervention strategies, appropriate mental health services, and policies, we propose to use this Planning Grant to foster collaboration between Canadian and Chinese researchers and key stakeholders in China, including local health and education authorities, schools, students with lived experiences, and parents. Through a collective and participatory approach, we plan to co-design a school-based longitudinal study on student mental health. This planning phase is pivotal in laying the foundation for a robust study. The grant will facilitate Canadian researchers' travel to China for a three-day planning event. 

During this immersive experience, our objectives are to understand stakeholder perspectives and their information needs, to strategize recruitment and data collection, to define study components and to identify suitable measurement tools. This participatory planning event is poised to foster strong partnerships between researchers and stakeholders. By working collaboratively, we aim to design a high-quality longitudinal study, producing meaningful impacts on mental health service delivery and policy development in China."
"Spatial and Language Discordance in Accessing Physicians among Older Immigrants in Toronto: Identifying Barriers, Facilitators and Interventions","['Wang, Lu', 'Guruge, Sepali']",['N/A'],"['Access To Healthcare Services', 'Location And Language Discordance', 'Older Immigrants', 'Physician Location']",19921.0,353133,"Physicians play a pivotal role in delivering primary and specialized healthcare to the aging immigrant population in Canada. While much research has examined the linguistic barriers immigrants encounter when accessing healthcare in general, less attention has focused on older immigrants' access to physicians, which are culturally and linguistically diverse and geographically clustered. The unequal spatial distribution of physicians across different urban and suburban neighbourhoods, as well as the rapidly evolving residential patterns of immigrant seniors create an alarming location and language discordance, or mismatch, between physician location and socioeconomically disadvantaged and linguistically-challenged older immigrants. The low-density and car-centric geography in the suburbs exacerbates this level of discordance. This discordance may lead to adverse outcomes for both the individuals and the healthcare system, as the cost of care may be much higher if a senior citizen's emerging health needs are not addressed in an efficient and timely manner. This project aims to bring together community members, community organizations and healthcare practitioners to generate knowledge of the barriers to and facilitators of older immigrants' use of culturally and linguistically accessible physician services. Locally relevant health programs and interventions will be explored to close the language and spatial gap in order to improve seniors' access to healthcare and their overall physical and mental well-being. This project will advance research on healthcare access for older immigrants and lay the groundwork for future inter-sectoral collaboration research. The project outcomes will provide practical implications for practitioners to deliver culturally-accessible health care and for community brokers to develop and implement programs to facilitate healthcare access to older immigrants, which are key to ensuring the healthy aging of immigrants in Canada."
Spatial and social patterning of COVID-19 prevention and transmission in Canada: Investigating the impacts of risk perception and preventive behaviour on individual activity space,"['Wang, Lu', 'Chen, Dongmei', 'Yang, Lixia']",['N/A'],"['Social, Cultural, Environmental And Population Health']",189050.0,422607,"Emerging and re-emerging global infectious diseases are presenting unprecedented public health challenges, resulting in negative, long-lasting health, sociocultural and economic consequences for individuals and communities around the world. As a global city, Toronto is home to one of the most highly-travelled populations in the world. It has been a significant receiving geography of a number of global infectious diseases. The project aims to understand the relationships among health risk perception, community prevention behaviour and individual activity space during the on-going global COVID-19 outbreak. Disease transmission in an urban centre is directly influenced by individual activity space and the effectiveness of preventive measures taken in a community, which is largely shaped by perception of the disease and its risk. The project will (1) explore the perception of COVID-19 and its risks among groups with different immigration status, socio-economic-demographic characteristics within Toronto's Chinese community; (2) examine how risk perception shapes prevention behaviour and individual activity space; and (3) assess how activity space is influenced by risk perception, prevention practices, and other factors through spatial-quantitative, mapping and qualitative analysis. Data will be collected from a community survey on risk perception, prevention behaviour and daily mobility, and focus groups on coping strategies. The project will contribute to the global response to the COVID-19 outbreak by providing evidence-based findings on community prevention behaviour in a large urban hub. It will reveal local perspectives, citizen approaches and community practices as outbreak response effort, and enhance our understanding of the cultural dimensions of the epidemic. It will yield implications for public health response in setting policies under time constraints and uncertainty, allocating resources, identifying high-risk groups and setting vaccine priority."
"Mobilizing the Chinese Immigrant Community and Battling the Potential COVID-19 outbreak in the Greater Toronto Area: Gathering essential information, creating a mutual support quarantine network and assessing psychological impacts","['Wang, Peizhong P', 'Yang, Lixia']","['Ye, Jun', 'Wei, Xiaolin', 'Zhang, Weiguo']","['Social, Cultural, Environmental And Population Health']",,422630,"The COVID-19 outbreak is raging in China and spreading across the globe. The situation is getting worse and may last longer than anyone can expect.  Despite of only eight confirmed cases, Canada is now shrouded in fear and worry in face of uncertainty.  

The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) has one of the largest Chinese communities in the world and thus bears the brunt of the fear, anxiety, and panic. This, coupled with English language obstacles, has enabled rumors and misinformation to explode on social media.  It has been suggested that the Toronto Chinese community is the most vulnerable, yet least prepared population for the potential COVID-19 outbreak. There is an urgent need to prepare and mobilize the GTA Chinese community to fight against the possible outbreak. 

In this context, the overarching goal of the proposed work is to assess the knowledge, develop effective epidemic control practice, and identify the psychological impacts of the disease. This will be achieved through coordinated efforts across communities, professionals, and local residents, to address three specific and inter-related objectives: 1) assessing GTA Chinese immigrants' knowledge, attitudes/beliefs, and protection practices toward COVID-19; 2) developing, evaluating, and optimizing a mutual-support quarantine network to contain COVID-19 from further spreading; and 3) assessing the psychological impacts and the associated predictors of the potential COVID-19 outbreak. 

The proposed project is culturally relevant, practical, and community-based. The research team is comprised of multidisciplinary researchers from the related fields of public health (epidemiology), psychology, sociology, and health policy. As part of the ongoing effort, the team has been closely working with the GTA Chinese community in various ways. This project will benefit not only the target population but also other communities in Canada."

As people age, however, they are more likely to develop dementia, a degenerative condition that often leads people having difficulties with everyday activities and needing to move into long-term care homes. To help persons with dementia stay in their communities for longer, public systems around the world are prioritizing ways of making communities more ""dementia-friendly"". This includes redesigning public spaces, infrastructure (e.g., pedestrian walkways, land use, transportation systems), and services to better accommodate older adults with physical and cognitive limitations. One problem that requires more attention, however, is how to ensure that rapid technological development is not posing an additional barrier to persons accessing public spaces and services (e.g., electronic payment machines, or information only available using a mobile phone). Fortunately, a few different groups around the world (e.g., Canada, Sweden, UK), with different expertise (e.g., urban planning, occupational therapy, computer science), have been tackling this issue and increasingly partnering with persons with dementia, technology designers, community organizations, and government policymakers. This project aims to bring together these different groups and share knowledge, methods, and ways of partnering with persons with dementia and other key stakeholders. We hope to build an international network and share knowledge and tools that will improve the development of more dementia-friendly services, technologies, and environments in Canada and around the world."
Effects of Arsenic on DNA Damage and Repair,"['Wang, Zhixin']",['N/A'],"['Arsenic', 'Cancer', 'Carcinogenesis', 'Dna Damage', 'Dna Repair', 'Environmental Influence On Health']",90000.0,227327,"Arsenic is naturally present in the environment. Long known as an acute poison, arsenic has come to be recognized in recent years as one of the most important environmental agents in causing cancers. The primary sites of human cancer associated with arsenic exposure are skin, bladder and lung, but the list may also include kidney and liver. Arsenic in drinking water, for example, currently affects more than 100 million people around the world. However, how arsenic causes various cancers is not understood. The primary objective of this study is to gain a mechanistic understanding of how arsenic causes cancer. Specifically, this study will investigate how arsenic interacts with another cancer-causing chemical and contributes to cancers. 

The rationale of this study is that arsenic itself may not react with DNA but it may interfere with cellular repair of DNA damage caused by other agents. Supporting evidence can be found from synergistic interactions between arsenic exposure and cigarette smoking in the induction of lung cancer. One of cancer-causing compounds in cigarette smoking is benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), which is the model we chose. The study consists of three main parts. The first examines whether arsenic affects the formation of DNA damage caused by BaP. The second investigates whether arsenic interferes with the repair of DNA damage that is caused by BaP. The third examines what specific process of the cellular repair is altered by arsenic. An important feature of this study is the use of newly developed ultrasensitive assays for DNA damage and arsenic. It enables the study to be conducted at very low levels of arsenic and BaP relevant to day to day exposure. 

The study will provide mechanistic insight for improved understanding of arsenic carcinogenic effects. By understanding causal effect of arsenic, regulatory agencies would be able to develop scientifically sound guidelines and measures to prevent and reduce cancers, particularly induced by arsenic."
The Relationship Between PTSD and Comorbid Post-trauma Mental Health Conditions Among Canadians,"['Wanklyn, Sonya G']",['N/A'],"['Comorbidity', 'Cross-Lagged Panel Design', 'Depression', 'Longitudinal Design', 'Posttraumatic Stress Disorder', 'Resilience Factors', 'Risk Factors', 'Structural Equation Modeling', 'Substance Use', 'Trauma']",105000.0,257565,"Over 75% of Canadians experience a traumatic event during their lives, and 9% of these individuals develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a chronic and debilitating mental health condition associated with substantial personal and societal costs, including overuse of healthcare resources and reduced workplace productivity. The estimated annual cost of PTSD is $40 billion. Many people with PTSD also develop major depressive disorder and substance use disorders, which are associated with additional economic costs. Yet, PTSD is generally investigated without considering these commonly co-occurring disorders. As a result, it is unclear if PTSD leads to depression and substance use. In addition, few attempts have been made to identify the factors that predict PTSD, depression, and substance use. This study will extend the literature by examining the relationships among PTSD, substance use, and depression symptoms over a one-year period in individuals who have experiencing a traumatic event. This study will also examine the risk and resilience factors that predict PTSD symptoms, and PTSD symptoms with co-occurring substance use or depression symptoms. Several of theses factors include sex, social support, and life stressors. A better understanding of the relationships between PTSD, substance use, and depression is necessary to identify Canadians at the greatest risk to develop these conditions after experiencing a trauma, and to improve treatments for individuals living with these conditions. The results of this study will guide treatment and prevention efforts, ultimately improving the health of Canadians."

There is a clear need for best practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of cardiometabolic disease. However, most guidelines have been developed without considering the unique needs of Aboriginal peoples. Moreover, there is an acknowledged translation gap between the research evidence and the application of this knowledge in the real-world setting (particularly within Aboriginal communities). In our collaborations with Aboriginal peoples, we are aware of the lack of culturally appropriate resources for Aboriginal youth and adults. Aboriginal community leaders often complain of inadequate continuing education and/or culturally appropriate resources to deal with the primary and secondary prevention of chronic disease (and obesity). We have recently created a series of recommendations for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiometabolic disease. We have recently sought to improve the translation of this information by creating novel interaction designs (i.e., the specific shaping of digital media for people's usage) through innovative web- and phone-based applications. However, we recognize that our messaging may be of limited value to Aboriginal peoples without a clear understanding of the needs of Aboriginal communities. Addressing this knowledge translation gap is essential for effectively meeting the needs of Aboriginal peoples. Accordingly, this planning meeting will bring together world-leading experts in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiometabolic disease, application designers, and Aboriginal leaders. It is our intention to use this planning grant as the catalyst for the development of new resources and collaborative grants that facilitate the translation of knowledge related to the primary and secondary prevention of cardiometabolic disease in Aboriginal peoples."

Several barriers to the translation and uptake of health knowledge have been identified, emphasizing the need to consider health from culturally appropriate and holistic manner. We have established how essential Aboriginal community leaders are in the delivery and uptake of health information. As such, our interventions have been designed such that Aboriginal community leaders are the key knowledge translation brokers. These interventions are highly effective leading to marked health benefits in the communities that we reach. However, we acknowledge that the long-term sustainability of these interventions is challenging, particularly in remote and rural regions. Also, our Aboriginal community leaders have acknowledged the need for advanced and on-going training to ensure a self-sustaining model wherein Aboriginal community leaders are the key advocates for health change. Accordingly, this proposal seeks to gather information from Aboriginal communities and their leaders regarding the needs of their communities, the barriers to healthy living, and the values, knowledge, and cultures that must be respected to create a self-sustaining model for healthy lifestyle behaviour change. In addition, we will seek the advice of world-leading experts in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiometabolic disease in Aboriginal communities. It is our intention to use this planning grant as the catalyst for the creation of a new training program designed to empower Aboriginal community leaders in the effective translation and uptake of healthy lifestyle behavior information within their community.

Starting August 2013, children less than nine years must use booster seats.  Motor vehicle crashes are a leading cause of death and injury for 4-8 year olds and many do not use a booster seat.  As of May 2013, cyclists less than 18 years of age must wear a bicycle helmet.  Children living in poverty are even less likely to use booster seats or bicycle helmets and have a higher risk of injury. To reduce the cost of obeying these new laws, there is no provincial sales tax on booster seats and bicycle helmets as of July 1, 2013 and a provincial low cost purchase program through schools has been introduced. Before the booster seat and bicycle helmet laws were passed, we counted the number of children using booster seats and bicycle helmets in the summers of 2010 to 2012: 15-31% used booster seats and 35% of all cyclists wore a helmet.  We will determine if Manitoba's new booster seat and bicycle helmet laws have increased use, reduced injuries, and if the laws are protecting all children and families equally. We will compare pre-legislation (2010-2012) and post-legislation (2014-2015) outcomes, including: injury, observed booster seat and bicycle helmet use, police enforcement and infractions, parent and child knowledge/attitudes/self-reported use, booster seat and bicycle helmet cost, and availability of low-cost or free booster seats and bicycle helmets to low income families, including use of loan and low cost purchase programs. By looking at more than the typical outcomes of injury and observed use, we will examine a greater impact of Manitoba's new traffic safety laws.  We will engage government officials, police, and families, to examine any unintended impacts, such as differences in use based on income.  Knowledge of inequities will help design more relevant promotion strategies to increase booster seat and bicycle helmet use and ultimately reduce injury and health care costs."

However, the statistics following sustained long-term health behavior change are discouraging.  There is a clear need to investigate what works in health promotion to sustain healthy behavior change over the long term.  This project seeks to explore dance and its accompanying benefits of music and artistic expression as a treatment and prevention option for diabetes and obesity and explore the effects of dance practice as potential mechanisms for long-term health behavior change.  Building upon our current projects, affiliations and working relationships, we are keen to develop projects on several fronts:  with older adults; with children; and with several First Nations communities.

Prevalence of and factors associated with dementia in Ontario First Nations,"['Warren, Laura']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal', 'Aging', 'Chronic Disease', 'Cognitive Impairment', 'Dementia', 'Epidemiology', 'First Nations Health']",108000.0,272864,"The objective of this research project is to identify factors associated with dementia in First Nations communities in Ontario.  To date, no research has been done investigating the impact of dementia on First Nations communities in Canada.  This will be the first Ontario-based project on the prevalence of dementia in First Nations seniors.  Identified risk factors associated with dementia in First Nations populations will be contrasted to the risk factors in the general Ontario population to understand unique health services required (if any).  By having a variety of sampling populations we may identify geographic/environmental risk factors associated with dementia in addition to high risk populations.  The results will be useful for First Nations communities, and also for guiding the clinicians and community organizations who serve them."

The objective of this study is to characterize the epidemiology of dementia diagnoses and care in Ontario Indigenous populations using data from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) and provincial health insurance claims datasets housed at the Institute of Clinical and Evaluative Sciences (ICES). We have established a Community Advisory Board (CAB) comprised of five members from a variety of research backgrounds, Indigenous communities and lived experiences to provide leadership, support and direction to all stages of our research. Specifically, the CAB will ensure we answer questions relevant to Indigenous communities, think beyond risk factors that have already been established for dementia and are relevant to the Indigenous community (e.g. heavy metal contamination), incorporate Indigenous healing and traditional medicine for dementia, help interpret our findings through an Indigenous lens (e.g. social determinants of health), and provide community feedback for all stages of research. This research project is the first of its kind in Ontario and will serve as a building block for future research, including work proposed by team 20 of the Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration and Aging (CCNA).  By characterizing the epidemiology of dementia cases and care in Indigenous populations we hope to identify risk factors, identify gaps in dementia health services, and increase awareness of dementia among Indigenous populations in Ontario."
Exploring the Mental Well-being of Impoverished Black Women at Risk of Intimate Partner Violence: A Grounded Theory Study,"['Washington, Danielle']",['N/A'],"['Black Feminism', 'Black Women', 'Class', 'Gender', 'Grounded Theory', 'Intersectionality', 'Intimate Partner Violence', 'Mental Health', 'Poverty', 'Race']",105000.0,475940,"Women suffer from higher rates of intimate partner violence (IPV) than men in Canada; the rates of IPV are higher among Black women. Racialized women are at an increased risk of poverty because of the multiple barriers they face and women who encounter the coexisting conditions of poverty and IPV are more likely to develop mental illnesses. However, a research gap exists surrounding the mental well-being of Black women living in poverty in Ontario who are at risk of IPV. We aim to understand the impact of poverty and IPV on the mental well-being of Black women in Ontario, and to analyze how the social positions of Black women influence violence in their intimate relationship, as well as their access to receiving supports across sectors. The research is guided by the following questions: 1) How do Black women who live in poverty and at risk of IPV describe their mental well-being? 2) Do the social positions-specifically gender, race, and class-of Black women with no fixed address in Ontario, influence the prevalence of experiencing intimate partner violence in their relationships? 3) Do the social positions of Black women influence the way in which they receive health/ social/ legal services support from across sectors? Conducting research within this area will support stakeholders in identifying the needs that are most salient to Black women exposed to poverty and IPV and struggling with mental health issues. Mental health services may be improved by ensuring that health professionals receive cultural competency and anti-oppression training to understand the factors that may contribute to poor mental health in Black communities. Findings will aid in the development of nursing interventions that seek to inform practice, policy and inform future research. Increasing access to IPV intervention services, prevention programs, and mental health services will be prioritized, thereby improving the mental health prospects of women who are disproportionately at risk."

Coping-Together is a program that helps to turn challenges into triumphs for patients with cancer and their caregivers, developed for early-stage cancer. Whether they are grappling with anxiety or treatment side effects, Coping-Together can be used to learn how best to overcome the physical, psychological, or social challenges of cancer. Users navigate 6 booklets at their own pace, using only the sections that apply to them, from the comfort of their homes. During my master's study, we interviewed 26 patients and caregivers facing advanced cancer and found that many aspects of the intervention were useful as is. Participants reiterated the main advantage of Coping-Together - it empowers them to develop autonomous coping skills, tailored to their needs.
But a few necessary adaptations were identified to respond to the specific challenges of advanced cancer (e.g., palliative care, the fear of recurrence, end-of-life planning). Patients and caregivers in this situation often find themselves with fewer resources and less recognition. 

To address these specific challenges, this study aims to modify the existing Coping-Together program to meet the needs of advanced cancer. Not everyone needs the same level of guidance, so different types of support will be offered. 25 patient-caregiver pairs will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 1) self-directed Coping-Together advanced or 2) usual care. After 6 weeks, they will provide feedback about how Coping-Together advanced worked for them. From there, they will be re-randomized to either continue with Coping-Together advanced or receive lay guidance. Those in usual care will be offered Coping-Together after 6 weeks. 

Coping-Together is poised to make a significant impact on the lives of patients and caregivers facing cancer challenges. By adapting and expanding its reach, we aim to provide a valuable resource to support those who need it most."

Emergency preparedness and response (EPR) is recognized as a core function of public health, with formal public health agencies expected to respond to a wide variety of emergencies. If public health experts are to play a greater role in managing complex emergencies in the future, it would benefit formal public health agencies to have evidence-informed and pedagogically sound emergency response training. To our knowledge, few formal models for emergency preparedness and response training specifically designed for public health exist. The COVID-19 pandemic has additionally brought into focus the need for such responses to have a heavy emphasis on health equity and decolonized approaches.

The proposed 1-year catalyst project aims to:
1. Examine emerging and existing theories and pedagogical approaches to public-health emergency response training; 
2. Collect and analyze key actors' descriptions of the gaps and strengths of existing EPR training programs in public health, including their views on equity-based approaches as well as decolonizing and indigenizing approaches to EPR; 
3. Apply new knowledge and generate new models to inform the development of new public health training programs designed to teach effective and equitable EPR. 

This project will serve to inform future work on the development of high quality EPR training for public health in Canada."
Presence and Length of Gay-straight Alliance Networks as Interventions for Emotional Distress,"['Watson, Ryan J']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1475.0,346771,"The presence and participation in gay-straight alliance (GSAs) at schools can serve as interventions at the population level and are related to well being for youth in school; in some cases, aspects of GSAs can buffer the negative association between school victimization and well-being. Some studies have confirmed that GSAs impact the school environment for sexual minorities (e.g., gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender). Almost all research on the role of GSAs has relied on cross sectional data and student-reported presence of GSAs. In this project, we explore how one population health intervention implemented at middle- and high-schools in British Columbia for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender adolescents might be associated with health and well-being over time. The objective was to examine how a GSA might ameliorate the experiences of students in unsafe school environments through information exchange mechanisms. We found that disparities in victimization and emotional distress varied by how long a school had a GSA and the gender of students. For example, in schools with GSAs that began before 2003, female students were more than 2x higher the odds and male students were nearly 3x higher the odds of reporting lower rates of teasing compared to their respective counterparts in schools with no GSA programs.
We suggest knowledge transfer strategies to stakeholders, such as administrators and researchers, who are invested in the adoption of interventions - such as GSAs - to protect sexual minority students at schools."
"Health and Well-being of Canadian Sexual Minorities: Stigma, Resilience, and Mental Health","['Watson, Ryan J']",['N/A'],"['Family', 'Lgbt Youth', 'Mental Health', 'Parent Support', 'Romantic Relationships', 'Social Support']",90000.0,338585,"Research in Canada and the United States over the past decade has found that lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth experience higher rates of health disparities relative to their heterosexual peers. However, most samples are so small that participants must be analyzed in aggregate as a monolithic sexual minority group. When considering protective factors that may mitigate health disparities of LGB youth, the role that interpersonal relationships are poorly understood. For example, previous research on family has been contradictory in explaining the role of parent support for sexual minorities' well-being. In addition, very little research has explored the role of same-sex romantic partnerships for youth; same-sex romantic partnerships remain stigmatized in North America, yet some literature suggests that these partnerships may be protective. 

The project aims are to a) investigate how parents and romantic partnerships mediate health outcomes (such as depression) for LGB adolescents over time, b) identify which aspects of parent and partner relationships are most protective, and c) identify LGB subgroup differences by disaggregating the sexual minority subsample using population level representative data in British Columbia. Based on previous literature, I hypothesize that mother support (specifically, care and warmth) will be most important for gay males whereas father support (specifically, closeness) will be most important for bisexual and lesbian females.  

The findings from this project have the potential to shape parent, partner, and community interventions that promote better psychosocial experiences for LGB youth. The results may also inform the practice of mental health professionals and school counselors to effectively work with LGB youth and their families."
Informing policy on drug-impaired driving in Canada: Driver perceptions and countermeasure impact,"['Watson, Tara M']",['N/A'],"['Alcohol', 'Drug Use', 'Impaired Driving', 'Injury Prevention', 'Policy', 'Qualitative Methods']",135000.0,319172,"Road collisions are a major health and social burden in Canada. Driving after drinking is a large contributor, but over the past few decades policies aimed at reducing this behaviour have shown substantial success. Evidence now shows that drug-impaired driving (DID) plays an important role in collisions. Successful initiatives will save many lives, but developing policy and programs to address DID is challenging because the evidence is new and evolving. Understanding DID is complicated by many factors including the effects of drugs, substance use patterns, and reasons for use. Qualitative research is valuable for understanding individual perceptions, awareness, and motivations regarding DID. I propose two-stage postdoctoral research that will help inform policy and collision prevention efforts.
 
The first stage will involve interviews with varied subgroups of drug-using drivers including: young and older drivers; those with substance use problems and/or have been convicted of an impaired driving offence; those who drive after using legal and/or illegal drugs, and after recreational and/or therapeutic drug use. Questions during this stage will focus on how drivers perceive the impact of drug(s) on driving skill, any steps taken to reduce impairment, motivations behind DID, awareness of laws, and opinions about DID countermeasures. In the second stage, I will compare policies focused on efforts to address DID in Canada and international jurisdictions such as the United States, European countries, and Australia. Interviews with relevant stakeholders will accompany the policy review. Different approaches (e.g., zero-tolerance laws, remedial programs) have been suggested or tried, but there has yet to be a comprehensive report about these initiatives or their impact in the literature. The proposed research will result in important new information about DID that will be highly valuable to injury prevention researchers and policymakers in Canada and internationally."
Understanding the Impact of Osteoarthritis on Depression in the Canadian Population,"['Watson, Tristan']",['N/A'],"['Causal Inference', 'Depression', 'Multimorbidity', 'Osteoarthritis', 'Pain', 'Population Health', 'Social Determinants Of Health', 'Survey Methods']",150000.0,437161,"In Canada, a major public health concern is that osteoarthritis (OA) and depression affects millions of Canadians, and both conditions co-occur in about 20% of adults. Most people know a friend or loved one whose quality of life has been negatively affected by either of these two chronic conditions. OA pain symptoms and depressive symptoms are two of the leading causes of disability in adults.  The double burden of having both OA and depression further compromises a person's quality of life and severely limits activity.

There has been inconclusive evidence regarding the assertion that OA can lead to subsequent depressive symptoms facilitated through pain.  In addition, there has been a lack of available Canadian data sources to examine the relationship between OA and subsequent depression in a population of adults where variables are measured across different time points (also known as a longitudinal study).  

There is a great opportunity to better understand the relationship between OA and depression, by using recent data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA). The CLSA provides pan-Canadian data that has information on OA, depression, pain, and other key variables. I will study the temporal relationship between OA and subsequent depressed mood using statistical methods appropriate for longitudinal data. 

A cure for OA does not exist at present, but it is possible to minimize the impacts of this debilitating health condition. Current OA treatment is focused on pain management, but it is not clear whether pain management is effective at dealing with the psychological consequences of OA.  The study results will help to clarify the risk of developing depressive symptoms among people with OA, in order to improve the lives of people with OA, by informing OA clinical management (e.g., screening tools for depression) and supporting health services planning (e.g., social support programs)."
The impact of family and school nutritional-related factors on dietary behaviour change in teens participating in a lifestyle modification intervention,"['Watts, Allison W']",['N/A'],"['Health Behaviors', 'Intervention Research', 'Nutrition', 'Obesity', 'Population Health']",72000.0,218625,"Childhood obesity is a major public health concern in Canada. Increasingly, it is important to determine what puts youth at risk for becoming overweight or obese, how to improve prevention efforts, and how to develop more effective interventions. Diet has been identified as an important lifestyle factor that contributes to weight gain and obesity. The family and school environments are known to influence adolescent's eating behaviours but little is known about the combined influence of factors in these environments on changes in eating habits as adolescents participate in an intervention to improve healthy eating and physical activity. 
The purpose of this study is to investigate how factors in the family and school environments influence dietary behaviours in adolescents. It is hypothesized that access and availability of unhealthy foods in the family and school environment, unhealthy food modelling, and frequency of purchased meals will be associated with poorer dietary habits and will impede dietary behaviour change as adolescents progress through the intervention. 
Data will be collected from 150 overweight or obese adolescents and one of their parents over an 8-month period in 2010/2012. A combination of web-based surveys and 24-hour recalls will be used to collect information from adolescents and parents about their dietary behaviours. Results from this research will provide timely evidence that informs obesity prevention efforts and the development of more comprehensive public health interventions."
"Violence and police harassment associated with barriers to drug treatment amongst women sex workers who use drugs in Metro Vancouver, Canada","['Watt, Sarah A']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,400268,"Background: High rates of drug overdose in North America highlight the need for improved drug treatment access, particularly for marginalized populations. Women sex workers (SWs) are often marginalized and face substantial health and social harms, including high rates of substance use. Relationships between violence, criminalization and barriers to health and harm reduction services among SWs are described elsewhere, with Indigenous SWs facing pronounced health inequities related to colonization and criminalization. However, little is known about SWs' access to drug treatment.
Aims: Identify correlates of drug treatment barriers and investigate interactions between police harassment and Indigenous ancestry on drug treatment barriers among SWs who use drugs in Vancouver, Canada.
Methods: Data were drawn from An Evaluation of Sex Workers' Health Access, a community-based prospective cohort of women SWs. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were used to investigate correlates of experiencing drug treatment barriers among SWs. A multivariate model examined interactions between Indigenous ancestry and policing in influencing drug treatment barriers.
Results: Among 644 SWs who use drugs, 29% faced drug treatment barriers over the 8-year study period. Gender/sexual orientation, opioid use, workplace violence, community violence, intimate partner violence and incarceration were independently associated with drug treatment barriers. In interaction analysis adjusted for key confounders Indigenous SWs who experienced police harassment faced the highest odds of treatment barriers.
Conclusions: Findings suggest violence and criminalization may impede access to drug treatment, especially for Indigenous SWs among whom police harassment may disproportionately threaten access. Findings highlight the need for improved drug treatment access and support the decriminalization of sex work and scale-up of low-barrier, trauma-informed, culturally-sensitive addiction programs and policies."

Pain in extremely low birth weight survivors: Severity and stability from adolescence to adulthood,"['Waxman, Jordana']",['N/A'],"['Extremely Low Birth Weight', 'Longitudinal', 'Pain']",1000.0,304117,"In the past 40 years, there have been vast improvements in the management and survival of those born at extremely low birth weight (ELBW; < 1000 g). Although the first generations of ELBW survivors are now well into adulthood, premature infants have been found to differentially respond to pain. However, there has been no research regarding long-term differences in pain in those born at ELBW compared to NBW controls. The objective of this study was to compare the severity and stability of pain concerns in those born at ELBW and NBW from adolescence to adulthood. 84 ELBW survivors born between 1977 and 1982 and 78 NBW controls had complete data present at ages 12-16 (Adolescent), 22-26 (Young Adult), and 30-35 (Adult). Participants were asked to rate pain concerns at 12-16, 22-26, and 30-35 years of age. A measure of physical pain concerns was created by summing the following items on a validated self-report measure, ""Aches and pains,"" ""Headaches,"" ""Nausea,"" ""Skin Problems,"" and ""Stomach aches."" ELBW survivors did not differ on a composite measure of physical pain concerns when compared to their NBW peers, suggesting the long-term outcome for some ELBW adults may not be characterized by increased self-reported levels of pain. Overall, pain concerns decreased across the lifespan; however, there was a trend towards the ELBWs exhibiting an increase in pain at ages 30-35 compared to NBW controls. It is important to compare the severity and stability of pain concerns in ELBW and NBW controls, in order for health care professionals to better understand the potential health consequences of premature birth. This will lead to more accurate predictions regarding quality of life for those born at ELBW across the lifespan. Furthermore, intervention programs designed to decrease pain concerns in ELBW survivors can be targeted at specific age groups that are found to experience heightened levels of physical pain."
Development of cardiovascular responses to acute pain in preterm infants: A systematic review,"['Waxman, Jordana']",['N/A'],"['Cardiovascular Reactivity', 'Infant Pain', 'Needle Pain', 'Systematic Review']",1000.0,324358,"Although heart rate is a common measure of infant pain, few studies have examined how heart rate responses to pain develop over the first year of life.  Therefore, our ability to understand and manage infant pain is hindered. The current comprehensive review aims to chart the development of heart rate responses to needle pain in preterm infants over the first year of life. A comprehensive search was conducted in four search engines. After removing duplicate articles, 6994 studies were assessed for eligibility to be descriptively analyzed in the review. Search results were limited to evidence-based methodologies, publication years (1980+), and age group (0-3 years). Thirteen studies were first separated by gestational age (GA) at birth (24-28, 28-32, 32-37 weeks). These groups were then qualitatively synthesized based on age at measurement. During the first week of life, a blunted heart rate (HR) response to needle pain was found in extremely premature infants (24-28 weeks GA). From 1 to 4 months, the extremely premature infants had increased heart rate following needle pain. In older infants (28-37 weeks GA), heart rate was variable over the first 4 months of life, but significantly increased in response to needle pain. When examining studies of preterm infants from 0- 4 months of age, cardiovascular responses to needle pain qualitatively differed based on gestational age. Longitudinal research examining preterm infants' heart rate response to needle pain over the first year of life is necessary to understand how premature infants physiologically respond to pain over time. Research in this area will lead to empirically based evaluation and treatment of preterm infants' pain"

While there is good evidence that the environment and genes act together to influence the emotional development of children, traumatic experiences have been the main environmental factor studied; (iii) We will focus on early emotional difficulties because these are the first emerging signs of possible later problems and their rates in toddlerhood (15-25% of children) are similar to those in older children. Focusing on early manifestations also allows for early identification and intervention; (iv) We will pay special attention to anxiety and depression since it is less studied in this age group and since both low birth weight and maternal depression are associated with depression in early childhood; (v) We will measure comprehensively childhood psychopathology by using reports by parents, teachers, children as well as a investigator-based parent diagnostic interview."

Differences by gender in the response to stress are well document in early emotional development but evidence is needed in older children and adults. Genetic differences in susceptibility to prenatal events are also important. Finally, the early environment as seen in early maternal care might be a significant positive or negative influence on the effect of prenatal, gender and genetic risk. For cost-effective interventions to exploit the higher neuroplasticity in children, such a complex developmental approach is needed to identify those at risk. This is more poignant given the availability effective individual and family interventions. We will examine these important questions by means of a collaboration of 4 prolific international longitudinal cohorts, in Canada (Maternal Adversity, Vulnerability and Neurodevelopment), the United Kingdom (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children), the Netherlands (Generation-Rotterdam) and Singapore (Growing Up in Singapore Towards Health Outcomes). With samples of 590-15,290 subjects with comparable data on prenatal exposure, genotype, early mother-child interactions and temperament as well as anxious and depressive psychopathology, we will develop a complex model of prediction of anxious and depressive psychopathology in early adolescence which would support efforts for prevention and early identification and intervention of this chronic disorder."
Developing a modular occupational health assessment tool for sex workers in the context of criminalization and stigmatization,"['Webber, Valerie']",['N/A'],"['Criminalization & Stigmatization', 'Health Technology', 'Legal Issues', 'Occupational Health', 'Sex Work']",135000.0,471989,"This research will consult sex workers in two sectors-massage parlours and porn production-about their occupational health concerns. The consultation process will involve a survey and focus groups with people of all genders working in Canada in one of these two sectors. The insights gained from the consultation process will be used to develop a resource-such as a smartphone application-that sex workers can use to inform their occupational health and safety protocols at work, including how to reduce the possibility of harm  even when ideal standards cannot be met due to ongoing criminalization and stigmatization. The tool will be designed to offer context-specific guidance rather than broad educational content. This is an important tool to develop because sex work entails several health considerations, such as sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections, HIV, and other viral, bacterial and fungal infections, as well as musculoskeletal and repetitive strain injuries. But because sex work in Canada is criminalized and marginalized, workers do not have access to the protections afforded by occupational health and safety law, nor can they access benefits like paid sick leave or worker's compensation. In the absence of these protections, self-regulation is the only recourse most sex workers have to protect themselves at work. Therefore, facilitating the participatory development of workplace safety assessments will benefit sex workers across the country by preventing illness and injury, and this in turn will benefit their families and larger communities."

Rationale: Community-based research offers the opportunity to include First Nation older adults as co-researchers as we build on values of aging at home and in First Nations communities. Drawing on the values of the Anishinabek, this community-based participatory action research project will aim to answer the research questions: What is an age-and-dementia friendly community model from the perspective of Anishinabek people in Atikameksheng Anishnawbek, Ontario? What are the perceived strengths, opportunities, and gaps in applying the model in current provincial and federal policy and funding structures?  Method: The Gaataa'aabing visual research method is a culturally safe Anishinaabek adaptation of the photovoice method, which will be used to bring together 10 older adults from Atikameksheng Anishnawbek over 12 months to discuss the strengths, challenges, and opportunities for aging well in their community. We will seek to include male and female adults, aged 55 or older with 1) memory loss, 2) mild cognitive impairment, or 3) dementia and their caregivers; as well as older adults who do not have memory loss.  Implications: This research aims to identify the lived experiences of the participants and develop an Anishinabek model of an age-and-dementia friendly community. In addition, we will seek a resolution from the Anishinabek Chiefs in Assembly to support the implementation and policy development of an age-and-dementia friendly community model."

Our proposed project will examine how people living with poverty manage their chronic pain during the time of COVID-19. COVID-19 response measures may be creating barriers to accessing services for those living with pain, like pain management services, leading to a spike in overdoses. Our research will also contribute to understandings of how people living with other chronic illnesses (including mental illness and persistent drug use) are variously impacted by pandemic policies, both negatively and positively, and are able to adhere to public health recommendations such as physical distancing and self-isolation. This knowledge will help governments better (re)design our systems and inform decision-making across Canada to ultimately strengthen our public health, health and social care systems now and into the future for all Canadians."

Infections in humans due to antimicrobial resistant bacteria originating from companion animals are becoming a concern. It is generally accepted that a high bacterial burden and high antimicrobial resistance gene copy numbers are present during an active infection. There is a gap of knowledge on the dynamics of transmission and selection of antimicrobial resistance at the companion animal-human interface. It is known that animals share antimicrobial resistant bacteria and genes with humans, but the extent to which this happens is unknown. Pet-Risk will evaluate the transfer of antimicrobial resistance between companion animals and household members during animal active infections and determine which type of infection (skin and soft tissue vs urinary tract infections) promotes a higher risk of transmission of antimicrobial resistance to humans. Furthermore, in a longitudinal study we will collect samples of infected animals and their household members at several time points, which will allow the assessment of critical control points at which interventions could substantially affect the spread of resistance. The causality and directionality of spread of resistance genes between humans and companion animals will be established in order to design and evaluate preventive and intervening measures for controlling resistance and diminishing the public health consequences of antimicrobial resistance."

Specifically, outdoor fine particulate air pollution is known to contribute to cancer and heart disease and emerging evidence suggests a possible association with brain illnesses including dementia. However, we still know surprisingly little about how the specific sources and components of particulate air pollution ultimately impact population-health.

New approaches to exposure assessment are needed to address this crucial knowledge gap.  These approaches must incorporate emerging technologies and new chemical assays and must be scalable to large populations to take advantage of population-based cohorts available in Canada. Moreover, this evidence must be integrated and communicated in a manner that is accessible to the general population to affect change not only through regulatory decision making but also through individual-level behavioural changes.
 
Our research program will address these issues in a number of important ways. The first theme will focus on developing new exposure models for airborne pollutants in metropolitan areas. One example includes combustion-related nanoparticles that have been shown to reach the brain and may contribute to neurological illnesses. The second theme will apply these new models to population-based cohorts to evaluate population health risks. The third theme will focus on panel studies of local environmental health issues that can inform policy interventions. One example includes evaluating the impact of air pollution from residential wood burning on children's health. The fourth component will integrate knowledge across program areas to provide direct dissemination of results to government stakeholders and the public. 

Our vision is to identify and evaluate new environmental risk factors for chronic diseases to decrease the burden of illness associated with environmental contaminants originating from human activities and climate change."

Currently, 1.4 million Canadians are living with the effects of brain injury, with 50,000 new cases occurring each year. Patient outcome after serious brain injury is highly variable. Following a period of coma (unconsciousness) lasting days or weeks, some patients make a good recovery, while others progress into a vegetative or minimally conscious state. Patients in a vegetative state appear to be awake but show no signs of awareness, whereas patients in a minimally conscious state show inconsistent signs of awareness. As it is difficult to predict who will make a good recovery after serious brain injury, families and physicians are forced to make treatment decisions in the face of uncertainty. Further the diagnosis of vegetative and minimally conscious states is itself difficult, with error rates as high as 43%. 

Recent advances in neuroimaging allow for the detection of intact brain functions that cannot be found by routine bedside examination. Neuroimaging offers the prospect of improved prediction of patient outcome and increased diagnostic accuracy. Remarkably, in 3 cases, neuroimaging has been used to communicate with patients thought to be vegetative or minimally conscious. Neuroimaging after serious brain injury raises difficult ethical issues that must be addressed before it can be responsibly adopted in practice. Our research team brings together philosophers, neurologists, and neuroscientists to provide answers to these difficult problems. We will ask whether patients who can only communicate through neuroimaging can participate in care decisions. We will develop a moral framework for interacting with these patients based on their ability to experience pain and pleasure. We will interview families to better understand their experiences and to develop educational materials. Finally, we will analyze the impact of neuroimaging results on end of life decisions."
Community-Based Assessment and Prevention of Tooth Decay for Children Experiencing Domestic Violence,"['Weijs, Cynthia']",['N/A'],"['Community-Based Health Services', 'Dental Public Health', 'Early Childhood Decay', 'Health Equity', 'Individuals Experiencing Domestic Violence', 'Social Determinants Of Health']",108500.0,387687,"Approximately 1/2 of children in Canada experience some tooth decay. Severe tooth decay is the number one reason for day surgery in young children (less than 5 years of age), even though it can be prevented. The estimated hospital cost alone for this surgery is approximately $21 million/year. The full cost to society is much more when you add on dental and anaesthesiology fees, parents' lost work time and travel costs. Preventing tooth decay is important, but our publicly funded health system provides very little dental care, and many Canadians cannot afford dental prevention or treatment services. Canada has some publicly funded dental programs available, but vulnerable groups especially, may not make use of them for various reasons. 

My program of work aims to support dental health for a hard to reach group-children in families experiencing domestic violence. Through this work we will be using a community setting to increase availability of publicly funded dental care for some of our most vulnerable community members. We are co-developing, implementing and evaluating a sustainable cavity prevention program with women's shelters and community agencies in Calgary.
 
This program addresses critical issues within Alberta Health Services to better use prevention services and eventually reduce emergency department visits, dental surgeries, and hospitalizations related to severe decay in young children. The proposal blends epidemiology (screening to identify cavities) with a social determinants lens (factors beyond individual responsibility) in a practical approach to improving early uptake of preventive dental services. Success will mean increased access to prevention and treatment services as well as a sustainable, efficient, and proven prevention program that can be easily integrated into Alberta Health Services publicly-funded oral health program."

It is common and causes pain, difficulty speaking, eating, sleeping, and learning. Health Canada reports that half of Canadian children have tooth decay.  Surgery as treatment for decay was the #1 reason for day surgeries  in Canada among children aged 1-5, costing $21.2 million/year between 2010-2012. That cost does not include specialist fees or the cost of treatments outside of hospitals, in private dental offices. Tooth decay can be prevented; it is important to find new ways to prevent, and reduce the burden of this health problem.
Part of the reason for such high decay rates is that dental care is not part of Canada's publicly-funded health care system. Therefore, it is important to find other ways to identify children who are at risk, and to make it easier for them to access dental services. A partnership between dental public health and community shelters to screen for and prevent tooth decay in children from families who are experiencing domestic violence, is one way to do this.
We will hold focus groups to better understand the needs of parents, children, and shelter staff, and identify the challenges of running a screening and decay prevention program within the domestic violence shelter system. The rich knowledge uncovered from those conversations will help us develop a strong program that can be run in several Calgary domestic shelters as a pilot project."

One possible mechanism is through heart rate variability (HRV), an indicator of autonomic nervous system functioning measured through non-invasive ECG recordings. The aim of the present study is to compare the links between obesity, sleep, and HRV in two large samples of Quebec children aged 10-12. The first is a population-based sample of children in Quebec, and the second is a cohort of youth at risk for developing obesity identified as having one biological parent who is obese. Each group completed detailed questionnaires asking about their sleep, and had anthropometric and physiological data measured by trained research assistants. Data analysis will be conducted to determine if there is a link between obesity and HRV across both groups, if this link is influenced by short total sleep time or disrupted circadian regularity, and whether the relation is stronger in the cohort at risk for obesity. The results will provide information to help scientists better understand the relation between sleep and obesity in youth."

Many youth do not receive needed care because of their insufficient knowledge for early identification, stigma about mental disorders, and lack of help resources. There is a need to effectively address these issues. My PhD research will focus on understanding effective mental health literacy programs that will address youth mental health for Canadian secondary schools. The fundamental assumption of mental health literacy programs is that increasing knowledge and awareness can lead to positive health improvements such as decreased emotional and behavioral problems, improved clinical and functional outcomes, and improved school performance among youth. The study will evaluate a mental health literacy program, Mental Health and High School Curriculum Guide. The program addresses brain functions, specific mental disorders, stigma about mental illness, help seeking resources and the importance of positive mental health. It will be evaluated among grade nine to ten students in Nova Scotia high schools with a cluster randomized controlled trial study design. The study will include the integrated knowledge translation component through the engagement of related stakeholders in each phase of the study. Should the program be effective, it will potentially enable both youth and educators to achieve better understanding about mental health, to reduce stigma about mental illness, and to appropriately recognize and respond to signs of mental disorders and therefore link with health care providers for treatment, and ultimately promote mental health in youth."

School-based mental health literacy interventions have been identified as a beneficial population health approach to address these challenges, however, this approach is not yet available for Indigenous youth. We will address this significant gap in secondary schools and the community by developing, implementing, evaluating and disseminating a school based mental health literacy intervention for Indigenous youth in Canada. 

This project will be led by a multidisciplinary team of members from Indigenous communities (e.g., youth, families, Elders, and educators), mental health professionals and researchers, policy makers, literacy experts and researchers. It will apply mixed methodologies of qualitative (e.g., focus groups, storytelling, narratives) and quantitative (prospective cohort study) designs to fulfill the project goals. In year 1, we will apply qualitative methods to conceptualize how the mental health literacy intervention will be built and will start developing the intervention. Meanwhile we will develop a national network of Indigenous organizations to observe and provide feedback on the project deliverables. In year 2, we will complete the creation of the intervention and investigate its impact in Indigenous secondary schools in Nova Scotia, Alberta, Northwest Territory, and British Columbia, applying a longitudinal cohort design (pre-test, post-test and follow-up). Qualitative methods will be applied to revise the intervention. In year 3, we will roll out the intervention and disseminate project results nationally. 

This project will create a freely available evidence-based school mental health literacy resources for Indigenous youth in order to improve their understanding about mental health and wellness, reduce stigma against mental illness, enhance help-seeking behaviours and other outcomes."

SV reflects a range of unwanted, coercive and non-consensual experiences, from sexting to rape. SV (including terms as childhood sexual abuse/CSA, sexual coercion in dating relationships, sexual exploitation of adolescents and emerging adults) represents a human rights, public health, and gender-based issue. Global population estimates of male CSA (8%) are in-line with Canadian national estimates (5.8% before age 16), and provincial estimates (e.g., 8.3% in Ontario).In US Justice data, where assaults were reported to police, in about 7000 incidents reported over a 5 year period, <9 years old was the peak age, followed by the 10 - 19 year old group. These took place most often in a residence, but also in a commercial place, college, and jail.  Males experiencing SV present to varying service systems - child welfare, street services, residential care, mental health and substance abuse services, emergency services - yet, may never have their victimization recognized, and trauma-focused services may be required, but do not exist or may not be made available. Further, some victims may be asymptomatic and function well in daily living. Importantly, this Teams' projects target both contexts of challenge (rural/remote Aboriginal; child welfare; homelessness etc.), as well as contexts of resilience (high school or university attending).  With stakeholders, this team seeks to fill in gaps on the level of SV among male youths; the processes underlying both impairment and resilience, and promising interventions."
Maltreatment and Adolescent Pathways (MAP) Research Study,"['Wekerle, Christine M']",['N/A'],"['Adolescent Dating Violence', 'Adolescents', 'Adverse Childhood Events', 'Child Maltreatment', 'Child Welfare Services', 'Mental Health', 'Substance Use']",3000.0,337374,"CIHR and IHDCYH has a mandate for supporting research into youth development, their trajectories of health, mental health and resilience issues. The Maltreatment and Adolescent Pathways (MAP) Research Study, its primary and secondary analyses, have been CIHR-funded. Youth who have experienced childhood maltreatment are at elevated risk for emotion dysregulation and more challenged relationships across development. The MAP study evaluates maltreated youth, at-risk for adverse health outcomes in adolescence, young adulthood, and across the lifespan, and tracks health-related issues at the stage-salient time of mid-adolescence, as well as maps issues over time, to young adulthood.
The MAP Research Study randomly selected youth who were system-involved (receiving child welfare services) to participate in a longitudinal tracking of mental health outcomes, obtaining a large sample of youth (N=561). Maltreatment among youth may go undetected, leaving these youth vulnerable to environmental stress, being mobile and street-involved, under-resourced, and disconnected to adolescent services. Normatively, mid-adolescence is a developmental window of health risk behaviours, with transition to high school and emergent adult role-taking, along with their attendant stresses. It can be a window of resilience from risk. Following 561 youth (aged 14-17) over a 3-year period, the MAP maps issues in at-risk youth, and potential resilience factors. This video focuses on the under-recognized problem of adolescent dating violence, and self-compassion as a resilience factor for dating violence, mental health, and substance use problems. This knowledge exchange effort identifies important change targets, and strategies for promoting resilience in youth. It highlights issues in child welfare system-involved youth, challenging for a better coordination and collaboration among social service and healthcare systems to support youth who exit their primary system of help by virtue of their age."

Indigenous youth face unique challenges as they must navigate three worlds: their traditional culture, Westernized society, and the on-line world (Wekerle, Waechter, Leung, & Leonard, 2007; Wekerle, Vakili, Stewart, & Black, 2018). In a 2016 review, technology is identified as a critical forum, given the confidence with which Indigenous youth approach its use to support their representation and content generation, to self-organize, and to access traditional information. In particular, health promotion approaches that utilize social media and digital technologies were identified as relevant and feasible (Rice, Haynes, Royce & Thompson, 2016). This project has two streams toward building a technology-based resilience curriculum for Indigenous youth from a stakeholder group of youth attending Kawenní:io/Gaweni:yo Private Immersion School on Six Nations of the Grand River territory. The school has been operating for the past 30 years, offering full immersion education and culture in Mohawk and Cayuga languages for Junior Kindergarten to Grade 12 students. Our goal is to develop a culturally-relevant resilience curriculum that embeds cultural teachings in gender, health, and wellness and embraces technology (i.e., the JoyPop app) as a facilitative tool for youth resilience, and to work toward an adapted, culturally-relevant (Haudenosaunnee) version of JoyPop to set the stage for further evaluation as a school health promotion initiative.  Also, we will address data sovereignty in planning how the app and questionnaire data is managed. Our goal is to apply for grants funds to continue to evaluate this model for other immersion and non-immersion schools for Indigenous youth."

Social prescribing is defined as a holistic, person-centred and community-based approach that identifies a person's non-medical, social needs (e.g. social support, income, food) and then connects that person to supports within the community through an empowering process of coproducing a social prescription.  The social prescription may include connection to material supports, lifestyle supports, psychosocial supports, nature-based connection or arts-based prescriptions.  These are community-based approaches to protect and promote health.

Dr. Welch also holds significant partnerships in advancing knowledge on social isolation and ageing and in long-term care, through her role at the Bruyere Research Institute.

Evaluating Political Strategies for Achieving Global Collective Action on Antimicrobial Resistance,"['Weldon, Isaac']",['N/A'],"['Antimicrobial Resistance', 'Cooperation', 'Global Health Governance', 'Institutionalism', 'International Relations']",105000.0,416882,"Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is an evolutionary process whereby microbes like bacteria, fungi, and viruses become resistant to the antimicrobial medicines we depend upon to stop their spread such as antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals. The challenge is that every use of these medicines diminishes their future effectiveness, thereby accelerating AMR. Eighty years of unmanaged antimicrobial use has accelerated the development of AMR to a point of global crisis. AMR is now one of the greatest public health emergencies of our time. Some microbes have already developed resistance to all known antimicrobials, which means previously treatable infections are now untreatable. Many already die from AMR, and we risk losing countless more lives if nothing is done. The good news is there are national-level policies known to effectively curb AMR, but the world is so interconnected that almost all countries must implement these policies at the same time in order for the regulations to work. The challenge, therefore, is to craft effective tools to support international cooperation and to help countries act collectively to address AMR. This project identifies and evaluates the various political strategies that actors in the international community, like the United Nations, the World Health Organization, NGOs, and political leaders, can use to improve cooperation on the global collective action problem of AMR. It also looks at the role that countries with strong histories of global health leadership, like Canada, can play in leading the global response. Like many of today's greatest challenges, solving this problem depends on globally coordinated collective action. Achieving this will require strong global leadership, presenting an opportunity for global health oriented countries, like Canada, to rise to the occasion. The research seeks to generate and translate social scientific insights to tackle AMR and improve and protect population health around the world."

CIHI has a five to ten year mandate to prioritize analytics for vulnerable populations, including individuals suffering from mental illness. Advances in deep learning and the availability of large health datasets, broadly and in some cases exclusively available to CIHI, has paved the way for new approaches to health-related predictive analytics.

As part of a postdoctoral fellowship at CIHI we propose to develop a deep learning-based framework that provides likelihood predictions for three future events in individuals with mental illness: 1) Probability of re-hospitalization, 2) Probability of emergency department visit, and 3) Probability of suicidal behavior. These predictions can help identify at-risk populations in order to adjust health services, reduce exposure to modifiable risk factors, evaluate suitability for patient discharge, provide early intervention, inform policy, and provide guidance for funding decisions based on predicted demands on mental health services.

In addition to my work at CIHI, I will be part of the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute (OHRI) and the Department of Medicine at the University of Ottawa under the supervision of Dr. Peter Tanuseputro. The OHRI is the research branch of the Ottawa Hospital, which is one of the largest learning and research hospitals in Canada. With Dr. Tanuseputro I will be using health data to study the effects of physician mental health on patient outcome, with a focus on machine learning. This is a first-of-its-kind opportunity where patient health data can be linked to the treating physician and the physician's mental health. This project will help identify areas requiring attention in the well-being of physicians, and translates well to workplace mental health in general and during times such as COVID-19."

This is predominately due to data collection systems that misclassify and/or exclude Indigenous peoples and weak Indigenous health service and program evaluation systems.  The most recent statistics are outdated (2006) and underestimate the prevalence of Indigenous commercial tobacco use. This research generated a unique primary dataset in a major urban area in one of Canada's largest Indigenous communities.

Our Health Counts Toronto uses Indigenous community driven processes to generate a comprehensive health information platform to understand and address critical gaps in urban Indigenous health and tobacco use. Trained local interviewers implemented a survey using Response Driven Sampling among Indigenous adults in Toronto for the generation of population-level prevalence estimates, including information on tobacco use. Statistical analysis was used to characterize and describe the results, determining prevalence of tobacco use by age, sex, education and household income.

Canada is a signatory to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) which recognizes the disproportionate harm caused by tobacco use and the need to engage with Indigenous peoples in planning, delivery, and evaluation of tobacco reduction programs and policies. However, the Indigenous population in Toronto continues to experience smoking rates nearly four times greater than the general population. This research highlights the need for recent and accurate population health data to shape and inform appropriate tobacco reduction programs and policies; reducing a completely preventable cause of morbidity and mortality."

Each study will include a common set of variables related to key measures of MHA, including: mood and anxiety disorders; violence; alcohol, marijuana and tobacco use and problems; burden of disabilities related to co-morbidities on individuals and their families; and biomarkers of stress. Community partners will take an active role in all phases of the research, and be especially important in applying research knowledge to improving health services and support systems. This community based approach will lead to a better understanding of causes and mechanisms of co-morbidity, increased sharing of findings among relevant disciplines, and strategies for improving prevention and treatment programs for those with co-morbid conditions."

The primary goal of this research is to use a strengths-based approach to evaluate how and for whom strengths and resilience resources mitigate the negative health impacts of trauma and stress on mental health and substance use challenges. We propose to conduct analyses of rich qualitative and quantitative data previously collected in two Ontario First Nations, supplemented with additional qualitative data. First, in-depth interviews as well as Photovoice data (i.e., photographs and corresponding narratives) from individuals who have lived experience with mental health and substance use challenges, will be analyzed to illuminate how strengths and resilience resources affect the process of recovery. Second, informed by findings from the qualitative analyses, quantitative analyses of general population survey data will identify unique patterns in the use of different sources of strength/resilience. We will also determine how strengths and resilience resources such as cultural identity and community strengths buffer the impact of trauma and stress on mental health and substance use outcomes. Together with community partners, we will integrate and synthesize the findings and develop key recommendations for strengths based programming. By integrating both qualitative and quantitative data, and partnering closely with community stakeholders in the analysis and interpretation of these data, this initiative will derive a deeper understanding of strengths and resilience resources and how they can be enhanced and reinforced to address mental health and substance use challenges in First Nations communities."

At least 50% of incidents of sexual violence involve alcohol. Alcohol-related sexual harassment and aggression (ASHA) by men toward women among young adults in bars and clubs is pervasive and normalized, negatively affects many young women, and contributes to ""rape culture."" Our previous research found that over 50% of young women had experienced ASHA at a bar on a single night out. Developing effective programs to reduce ASHA requires a better understanding of why men engage in ASHA perpetration. Our research on male-to-male bar physical aggression demonstrated that men are more likely to be aggressive if they view such behavior as normal and acceptable, and if their male friends, especially peer leaders, support such behavior. Extending this work, we will examine how young men's beliefs/attitudes and peer group dynamics contribute to their likelihood of perpetrating ASHA and preventing or stopping ASHA (bystander action). Building on successful research methods implemented by our team, we will recruit young adult men (individually and in groups) in bar districts to participate in street surveys, focus groups and online surveys to: 1) develop and validate a multi-dimensional questionnaire assessing men's beliefs/attitudes about ASHA and determine how they are linked to ASHA perpetration and bystander action; and 2) determine how peer group attitudes, peer norms and peer status within peer groups are linked to ASHA perpetration and bystander action. We will work closely with key stakeholders (e.g., bar owners, bar-goers, sexual violence prevention/treatment professionals, police, college/university representatives) to use the findings in developing preventive interventions and policies to reduce ASHA in bars/clubs."

The project aims to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic in two First Nations by implementing and enhancing the FNWI. 
Building on strong research partnerships with two First Nations, we will develop sustainable mental wellness strategies in both communities and disseminate knowledge to promote successful wellness strategies in other First Nations. Participatory Action Research will be used to develop strategies that are strengths based, culturally appropriate, built around community needs, and informed by previously collected qualitative and quantitative data. Wellness promotion, prevention of MHS challenges, and community and individual interventions will use community-driven methods that are informed by local data and draw on strengths and resilience resources within the communities.

Mental health services often fail to foster meaningful and active involvement from community members in service planning, with community members having little or no involvement in the decision-making process. There is an urgent need for innovative community-driven initiatives grounded in local contexts and culturally specific Indigenous practices, priorities, and knowledges.

Many Indigenous families within Canada are experiencing enormous stress, while also experiencing greater disconnection from community supports and resources. Likewise, organizations serving Indigenous youth are struggling to understand the most important needs and resources of the communities and families they serve. 

This project, in collaboration with an Indigenous-serving substance use treatment organization and a First Nations school, seeks to understand the most important needs of potential interventions among First Nations and Inuit families in eastern Canada. With knowledge obtained from this research, these partners will be able to identify potential interventions to best meet the needs of the youth and families they serve--particularly for supporting youth who have or at risk for developing substance use problems. We also expect to understand key concerns concerning service utilization in the context of ongoing settler-colonialism (including recent events such as the identification of children buried at former residential schools). A strength of the proposal is that it is rooted in local initiatives-thus maximizing relevance of findings-but also includes data collection with multiple diverse First Nations/Inuit communities-thus increasing the relevance of findings across Indigenous communities across Canada."

Because HIV and other blood-borne diseases are transmitted through injection drug use, research has focused on preventing the initiation of such behaviours. Of particular concern, then, is that research suggests that proximity to a drug market may increase the risk of initiation illicit drug use and the initiation of drug dealing among vulnerable populations such as street youth. The proposed research project consists of an investigation of the factors that make individuals in vulnerable populations such as street youth more likely to engage in drug dealing.  As well, this project will also investigate the factors that influence individuals entrenched in a drug market scene to cease both drug dealing and injection drug use. This investigation will use data collected among illicit drug users and street youth in Vancouver over three years. By focusing on initiation into drug dealing and cessation of drug dealing and drug dealing, it is hoped that this research will allow for the development of effective interventions aimed at preventing drug market involvement.  Further, by focusing on the factors that affect cessation of drug use and drug market involvement, this investigation will also provide a framework within which to develop interventions targeted towards entrenched drug market participants. Given the intimate relationship between drug dealing and drug use at the street level in Vancouver and other Canadian urban areas, a project investigating both of these phenomena, and the way that they interact, will provide important findings that have implications for the development and implementation of a wide range of public health interventions"

At present, though, there are no effective and scalable approaches to preventing people from starting to inject drugs. However, research does indicate that people who already inject drugs play a critical role in facilitating the entry of others into injecting. Emerging evidence also suggests that enrolling people who inject drugs into medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder (e.g., methadone or buprenorphine) may reduce their risk of initiating others into drug injecting. The overall goal of this project is therefore to investigate whether enrolling people who inject drugs in medication-assisted treatment can help them reduce their risk of assisting others into drug injecting, and to determine how effective, adaptable and scalable this approach to preventing injection drug use can be across different settings.
This study -- known as PRIMER II (Preventing Injecting by Modifying Existing Responses) -- achieves this goal by pooling data from 5 cohort studies of people who inject drugs across North America in 6 different settings. These include cohort studies in Vancouver and Toronto; Baltimore, Rural Kentucky, and San Diego (USA); and Tijuana, Mexico, which collectively provide data from approximately 5,000 participants, making this the largest study of injection initiation to date."

To do that, the T-DOT study will link behavioral data collected over time from a cohort of people who inject drugs in Toronto with administrative datasets that include comprehensive clinical data from all Ontarians. This is important because currently, data from people who inject drugs about their treatment and other clinical experiences is almost always collected as self-report, making it difficult to confirm clinical outcomes.

It is also a high injury risk team sport, with the rate of injury as high as 77 injuries every 25 matches and a concussion rate as high as 20 concussions every 25 matches. Several strategies have previously been used to reduce injury risk, including the use of a sport-specific neuromuscular training warm up program. Other promising approaches for reducing concussion risk include rule changes (e.g., greater penalization of head contact, height of the tackle) and tackle training for improved technique. To date, a large number of the rugby studies have been conducted outside of Canada, where rugby is a well-established sport played from a young age. This is not currently the case in Canada. As such,  it is unclear whether similar injury prevention strategies will be effective in reducing concussion and injury more broadly. This research project will therefore investigate whether introducing a targeted rugby-specific neuromuscular training warm-up program, potential rule change and/or tackle training would be beneficial in reducing injury risk in the context of the Canadian youth. If successful, these strategies would have significant impact on the personal health of players as well as the health care system on which they rely on for care. Injury and concussion rates present a significant concern for rugby as it grows throughout Canada and despite improved understanding of the injury, there are still significant health related consequences for the injured player, including financial cost of treatment, inability to participate in physical activity and importantly in the context of concussion, potential absence from academic pursuits. We anticipate that participation rates will continue to rise and therefore, significant emphasis needs to be placed on prevention strategies to ensure the increased participation does not result in a corresponding rise in injury and concussion."

In Newfoundland and Labrador, it is estimated that one quarter of preschool children are overweight or obese.  Several studies on obesity in children show an association between excessive body fat and risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, increased incidence of asthma and increased risk of Type 2 diabeties (a disease that until recently was only diagnosed in adults). Obese children are also more likely to experience psychological problems and lower levels of income and educational attainment in the future. 

There are many factors that are both associated with and predictive of obesity, including genetics, individual lifestyle choices and community structure. This Café Scientifique will discuss the genetic basis of childhood obesity, the link between breastfeeding and obesity, and the types of activities that promote active lifestyles as a way of combatting childhood obesity.

Event 2: 

Recent epidemiological studies have suggested that the diet of the mother during pregnancy and lactation can have a major impact on the health of the offspring later in life. 

In one animal based study at Memorial, mothers were given a diet high in saturated fat that reflected the typical North American diet.  The offspring of those mothers had high cholesterol, lipid and triglyceride levels in their blood, even after a healthy diet during their lives. The research also showed that certain genes that control those parameters were changed in the offspring.

This Café Scientifique will delve into the connection between maternal diet and heart disease, diabetes and obesity in offspring.  Understanding the contributing factors to these diseases can help researchers, clinicians and the general public work towards prevention."

Tea Time: Building Communities of Women Living with HIV,"['Whitbread, Jessica']",['N/A'],"['Community Based Research', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Social Support Structures', 'Women']",17500.0,234707,"How do community-based support networks address the health needs of women living with HIV? 
Using the concepts of tea parties warm environments will be created to engage in critical discussions  about issues related to HIV. Tea parties are places for women to get together, share food and dialogue about issues that are important to them. A series of tea parties will be hosted in diverse and accessible locations moving away from more sterile meeting rooms and clinical settings where focus groups are often held. Participants will be encouraged to suggest locations, host at their homes, co-facilitate, and bring baked goods, to shape their experience. Unlike in traditional focus group models, the participants will be encouraged to take the lead in creating spaces that are conducive to their support needs. At these events, women will be asked to share their experiences of how they have or have not used community-based support networks in order to address their health needs. They will be asked to talk about where they go to get supports, what current programs exist, what their experiences have been like, and to identify gaps in service provision. Other guiding questions will include asking the women to share their personal stories and their thoughts on the types of supports that they need in order to improve their quality of life. 
Through this research data will be collected in order to inform future programing for AIDS service organizations, respect the self determination of WLHIV by creating opportunities to build their capacity and participate in research development and dissemination, and contribute towards the strengthening and rebuilding of a community of women living with HIV."
Socio-economic differences in the implementation of smoke-free policies in the home and car,"['White, Christine M']",['N/A'],"['Population Health', 'Public Health Policy', 'Second-Hand Smoke', 'Smoke-Free Policy', 'Socio-Economic Status', 'Tobacco Control']",17500.0,199853,"Second-hand smoke (SHS) kills more than 1,000 Canadians every year. Although provincial legislation has made workplaces and public places smoke-free, many Canadians, especially children living with smokers, are exposed to SHS while at home and/or in cars. Children exposed to SHS are at increased risk for asthma, pneumonia, and even sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Accordingly, seven Canadian provinces have banned smoking in cars with young children. Smoke-free policies such as these must undergo evaluation to provide evidence of their effects and to help inform future policies.

This study will use data from the International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation Project (ITC Project) to investigate how smoke-free car laws impact smoking in the home. The ITC Project has collected data from adult smokers using annual surveys over the past 7 years. The current project will link this data with the implementation of smoke-free policies in the homes and cars of adult smokers in Canada over the 7-year period, making special note of differences in the effectiveness of policy implementation across sub-populations. The study will compare the implementation of the new smoke-free car laws with trends in smoking rates in the home over time to determine how smoke-free car laws impact smoking in the home. 

The proposed research has the potential to examine population-level trends in the main source of SHS for Canadian children. Findings from this study will help policy-makers evaluate the success of existing laws and initiatives that promote smoke-free homes and cars. The findings will also highlight potential gaps and specific sub-populations in which levels of protection from SHS may be lower. Future initiatives that encourage the implementation of smoke-free policies could be tailored to reach these sub-populations. In summary, this research will help ensure that strong smoke-free policies are in place and that they are effective across different sub-populations."

Health care professionals must find ways to collaborate more effectively with each other to meet patient and societal health care needs in the complex health systems of the twenty-first century. Better interprofessional collaboration can improve professional relationships, enhance patient safety, increase efficiency and coordination, reduce medical errors, reduce health care costs, greater provider and patient satisfaction and improve health care outcomes. Interprofessional education (IPE) is considered a key means to enable this transformative change. Surprisingly, despite significant investment in IPE worldwide, many issues remain, and evidence to support the efficacy of IPE is inconclusive at best. Understanding the interplay of educational practices and power can open the field to new possibilities for better health professions education. This research addresses this important issue by identifying and analysing the taken-for-granted assumptions that underlie IPE though an examination of IPE discourses. Discourse analysis is based on the importance of language in shaping how we think, what is valued, and what individuals and institutions are accepted as important and powerful.  In this research, key IPE documents are assembled and analysed to identify the effects of various discourses. This will allow for better understanding of how different professions, disciplines and stakeholders understand and use these IPE discourses. High quality healthcare practitioner education is fundamental to the delivery of high quality healthcare. By identifying areas of strength as well as gaps and limitations in current approaches to IPE, this work will enable more effective ways of training health care practitioners to provide the collaborative, systems-based care our society requires."

A return to simple and historically successful micronutrient interventions: thiamin-fortified fish sauce combats 'hidden hunger' in rural Cambodia,"['Whitfield, Kyly C']",['N/A'],"['Population Health Interventions', 'Scale Up And Scale Back']",1356.0,343345,"Food fortification, or adding vitamins and minerals to commonly consumed foods, has been successfully employed in Canada since the mid-twentieth century. Salt iodization, the addition of vitamins A and D to milk, and B vitamin fortification of white flour have nearly eradiated micronutrient deficiency diseases in Canada and throughout the economically developed world. However, the lessons learned from this simple, cost-effective, sustainable, and 'passive' intervention have not transcended borders for widespread use in all developing regions. In Cambodia, only iodine (salt) fortification is mandatory, and although smaller scale iron (fish and soy sauce) and vitamin A (vegetable oil) fortification programs are being piloted, morbidity and mortality caused by micronutrient deficiencies continues to plague vulnerable groups, including young children and childbearing women. Thiamin (vitamin B1) deficiency, for example, remains an often-overlooked public health issue in Cambodia, causing an estimated 500 infants deaths annually. Using thiamin-fortified fish sauce as a case, we will explore how fortification can be a simple, sustainable, and passive solution to combat 'hidden hunger' (micronutrient deficiencies) in resource-poor regions."

Some evidence suggests that stigma is a result of inaccurate portrayals of people with mental illness in the media and film, as well as low levels of mental health knowledge among the general public. Studies show that stigma can be lowered when people learn about the facts and realities of life with mental illness through live or video contact with people with mental illness. Locally grounded studies involving people with mental illness from start to finish may be the most effective ways to combat stigma. As such, in this study, we will train people with mental illness in the scripting, filming and editing of short documentary type videos. They will then create a series of educational videos outlining the realities of life with a severe mental illness, including discussion of barriers and facilitators to recovery. The resultant videos will be shown at health-care settings and other places as educational tools to reduce stigma associated with mental illness and educate key target groups.

It can lead to shame, self-hatred, and can stop people using services. Stigma can also lead the public to stereotype people with mental illness as dangerous or lazy. Research shows that the general public stigmatizes mental illness because of what they see in the media. If they constantly read that people with mental illness are violent, dangerous or lazy, then they act to distant themselves. Thus, changing media coverage can considerably reduce public stigma. 

Whitley has conducted a study from 2005 to the present examining Canadian media coverage of mental illness. His study shows a considerable improvement in Canadian media coverage. This could be due to the targeted activities of the Mental Health Commission of Canada. For example, they organized for Whitley and others to travel to major journalism schools in Canada to hold informative seminars for journalism students. They also produced guidelines on how best to report mental illness; with 5 000 distributed to newsrooms across Canada. They also developed an on-line course for journalists on how to report mental illness which has been widely used. Whitley has also co-created anti-stigma videos for use by the media. This approach has been called 'the Canadian Model'. 

Evidence suggests that stigma is high in Latin America, and that resources are not readily available for national anti-stigma campaigns. As such, changing media coverage of mental illness in these countries may have a particularly powerful effect. Whitley will thus travel to two Latin American countries, Mexico and Chile, to present the 'Canadian model' to leading researchers. He will also brainstorm with these researchers to plan a new action-research project to in these countries to harness the media to reduce mental illness stigma and improve public attitudes. This new project will be finalized during a meeting in Montreal attended by researchers from Mexico, Chile and Canada."

In 2012, collisions in Canada caused by cannabis resulted in estimated costs of over $1 billion. Evidence suggests that legalization in some jurisdictions has led to increases in driving under the influence of cannabis (DUIC). While collisions and fatalities caused by DUIC have been most common among young drivers, the increase in DUIC following legalization appeared to be a result of increases in DUIC among older drivers compared to youth. Several impaired driving countermeasures (e.g., graduated licensing) are designed specifically to target young drivers. If legalization results in larger numbers of older cannabis-using drivers, it is important that we understand how cannabis affects driving in both young and older drivers in order to target countermeasures appropriately. It is well known that alcohol increases collision risk among young drivers at a faster rate than among older drivers, which has been attributed to inexperience with both alcohol and the driving task. Evidence regarding possible differences in cannabis use frequency in young versus older populations has varied; but, across populations, use frequency impacts the drug's cardiovascular and cognitive effects and the subjective drug high produced. This study will assess age differences in the effects of smoked cannabis on simulated driving and will explore factors that may significantly affect these differences. Young (19-25 years) and middle-aged (35-45 years) occasional and frequent cannabis users will smoke a cannabis or placebo cigarette in each of two sessions. Before and after smoking, participants will operate a driving simulator, complete cognitive/psychomotor tests, and provide oral fluid and blood samples. Results of the study will have immediate implications for impaired driving prevention, legislation and policy, including standards by which enforcement officers judge driver impairment."

Adolescence is a transitional period marked by a dramatic increase in the prevalence of depression as well as an increase in the engagement in health-risk behaviours, such as unsafe sexual intercourse or drug use, which entail future consequences. Those who experience depression are more likely to engage in health-risk behaviours, and the engagement in these behaviours further increase the risk for later depression. Maternal depression has been linked to offspring depression, and depressed individuals who have depressed mothers appear to fare worse than depressed individuals without depressed mothers. Maternal depression has been linked to future engagement in substance use. The relationship between health-risk behaviours and depression is complex, yet much of the research has been conducted cross-sectionally; as such, much is left unknown about the temporality and causality of this relationship. Additionally, much of the research focuses exclusively on one or two health-risk behaviours, thereby neglecting the potential relationships between the behaviours themselves. This study aims to investigate longitudinally whether depressed adolescents from depressed mothers engage in more health-risk behaviours compared to depressed adolescents without depressed mothers. This study also intends to investigate potential gender differences in the adolescents' engagement in a variety health-risk behaviours, as well as examine whether relationships exist longitudinally between the behaviours themselves. This research will both assist the understanding of depression, and will identify the appropriate vulnerable population, thereby helping to shape appropriate public health interventions."

Typically, studies on barriers to accessing food are represented by research focusing on either food affordability on the one hand, or simple spatial representations of ""food deserts"" on the other. However, these dominant approaches neglect to consider the impact of time use and activity spaces, and their related drivers like transportation availability, housing options, and employment. By not incorporating time use and individual-level activity spaces, these studies are limited by conceiving of the food shopping process as either aspatial (in the former case), or through an overreliance on relatively simple spatial frameworks (in the latter case). Both cases often neglect important and relevant temporal constraints faced by many lower-income populations. This CIHR Planning Grant will be used to help establish research relationships, critically assess the viability and necessity of integrating time use and time pressure into food accessibility studies, and test data collection tools that might have the potential to help disentangle the links between people's food environments, spatial access, travel patterns, time pressure, and socioeconomic status. Three distinct activities will aid the PA and co-applicants as they organize for the submission of a CIHR project grant in 2018: 1) a workshop will be held with the applicants and experts who primarily focus on either the economic or spatial aspects of food insecurity to discuss the utility of integrating time pressure, 2) a series of research team meetings will be held to determine an appropriate study area, sampling frame, and data collection tools, and 3) the preliminary assessment of the data collection tools being considered for use in the proposed research project."

1.Analyze models of global health governance and accountability by comparing case studies with variable outcomes to clarify the lessons learned and identify best governance practice;
2.Compare policy stewardship strategies to address issues of the global commons for AMR in food and agriculture, industrial processes and healthcare practice to identify effective international standard setting approaches and incentives that support compliance;
3.Model a range of infectious disease and AMR strategies to forecast their policy impact in preventing, managing and combating infectious disease.

As members of a proposed World Health Organization Collaborating Centre on Global Governance of Antimicrobial Resistance, the applicants will engage in synergistic research that supports global monitoring of country actions on AMR.

Studies of elder abuse detection have largely ignored nursing home seniors because screening tests had not been published that were suitable for people living in this setting.

In 2019, our team published the results of the our adaptation of the Elder Abuse Suspicion Index (EASI) that would be appropriate for use in the nursing  home, or long-term care (LTC) setting (the EASI-ltc). The purpose of this project is to evaluate whether the EASI-ltc is feasible and valid to use and whether its use is acceptable to nursing home staff, and to residents and their families.

Our study will take place in 7 long term care nursing homes and 2 intermediary care homes in Montreal, Quebec that represent both English and French-speaking communities. Since the EASI-ltc was designed to raise suspicion of abuse that would initiate an investigation by trained personnel, all participating residents will subsequently undergo a follow-up assessment led by a trained social worker with experience working in the nursing home setting. Finally, we will ask administrators, managers and staff as well as residents, their families and friends to give us their feedback.

The EASI-ltc is the first published tool to detect elder abuse in this vulnerable population. While the problem of elder abuse among the institutionalized elderly has long been recognized as an urgent issue, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought the needs and rights of older adults living in nursing homes to the forefront. This proposed study, therefore, responds to an urgent need to identify abuse and gives a voice to Canadian nursing home residents."

What is less known is how the restrictions that governments have requested to ""flatten the curve"" may have affected the mental, social and economic health of the population. Recent reports suggest that within populations, there is inequality in how these restrictions have been experienced. For example, job losses are gendered (UN, 2020; Statistics Canada 2020a) and racialized (NPR 2020). Concentrated outbreaks-in meat packing plants, and in long-term care homes have been reported widely in all three countries (Bragg, 2020, Reuters 2020). Racialized peoples are also overrepresented in industries where COVID-19 infections are more likely such as food service and manufacturing, hospital and long-term care staff (IOM 2020; Block and Dhunna, 2020). Because the virus preys on people in vulnerable situations such as overcrowded housing and work stations, these conditions are frequent among racialized persons, Indigenous persons and newcomers, our project answers two central questions: 1) How have COVID-19 related government imposed regulations differentially influenced the mental health and well-being of Indigenous peoples, racialized persons and immigrants? And 2) to what extent have socioeconomic inequalities faced by Indigenous peoples, racialized persons and immigrants influenced their experience of COVID-19 and its related social and economic restrictions? Given our connected borders and interconnected cultures and people, we argue that success rests upon our ability as a continent to work together to protect one another and eventually eradicate this virus which necessitates the three country comparison of Canada, US and Mexico.

The causes of obesity are complex, and include social, behavioural, and cultural aspects. It has been found that aspects of the built environment, including ""walkability"" and access to play space, as well as the social composition of neighbourhoods can affect obesity. However, there has been little attention paid to the determinants of obesity among Aboriginal children, and less among children living outside of First Nations reserves or other Aboriginal communities, despite the fact that more than half of Aboriginal children live in these 'off-reserve' areas. Factors affecting the health of these children may include social and cultural conditions unique to Aboriginal children. It is important that any intervention program be grounded in Aboriginal worldviews. This project addresses this knowledge gap by investigating the predictors of obesity among Aboriginal children and developing a culturally-appropriate framework for the design of a 'healthy weights' intervention targeted to Aboriginal children. Our research team consists of non-Aboriginal and Aboriginal researchers, including geographers, sociologists, dieticians, and pediatricians, as well as local community organizations, and advisory committee. There are three components to the study. The first is the use of Statistics Canada survey data to investigate the determinants of obesity, including characteristics of children, families, and neighbourhoods. The second is to use focus groups of parents of off-reserve Aboriginal children to understand their perceptions of the factors that affect their children's risk of obesity, and to identify appropriate intervention strategies. The third is a series of stakeholder consultation meetings with Aboriginal community organizations, clinicians, and public health practitioners to come to a consensus about a culturally-appropriate framework for an intervention."

To this end, we identify a model of Aboriginal child health that consists of three broad conceptual categories of health determinants: community conditions, family environment, and child characteristics. By placing a strong emphasis on the community-specific determinants of health, the model provides an alternative paradigm that accentuates the role of geographic, cultural, socio-economic, and political contexts of the research on Aboriginal child health. We propose to test the model by conducting a secondary data analysis on survey data files and administrative databases that contain information on Aboriginal children, their families, and the communities in which they live. The objective of the current phase of the project is to conduct exploratory work on the available data sources, determine appropriate techniques for data analysis, and construct a team of researchers and stakeholders. The results of this research will provide communities and governments the necessary information to identify priorities and set standards for programs and policies to enhance the health and well-being of Aboriginal children."

This project will make use of new sources of high-quality data from Statistics Canada and the Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research Consortium, that link information on various domains of health to urban environmental risk factors. The overall objective of this study is to contribute to addressing important knowledge gaps by conducting unique research on how exposure to natural, built, and social environmental risk factors over time affects chronic conditions in cities across Canada. Currently, more research is needed in this area, given the lack of comprehensive data sources to assess and monitor the long-term effects of the urban environment on chronic conditions.

In addition, living in large cities, may increase their risk for poor health outcomes. As hot temperatures may affect people and communities differently, it is important to determine which groups are the most vulnerable, so appropriate steps can be taken to lower their risk of illness or death. To answer these questions, we will use several clinical and administrative datasets and population cohorts from Statistics Canada, ICES, and Health Canada, as well as environmental data from the Environment Canada and the Canadian Urban Environmental Health Research Consortium. Additionally, we have established a collaborative team with expertise in population health, environmental health, and statistical analysis. The results of this study can contribute to policy development for a national surveillance system, and targeted local public health strategies that can be used to reduce the health impacts of climate change, particularly for vulnerable groups."

We also do not know which groups of children use emergency departments the most, or which children go to emergency departments for nonurgent problems that could have been prevented or treated elsewhere. It would be very useful to know how individual characteristics such as a child's sex, age, family income, and the neighbourhoods they live in make some children more likely to use emergency departments, as well as how all of these patterns changed around the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this project is to produce up-to-date information on how many children in each community are frequent emergency department users and how many use emergency departments for nonurgent problems. We also aim to look at which groups of children use emergency departments, to see if there are common characteristics that could predict other children's outcomes. Together with our team of 25 researchers and clinicians, and national healthcare organizations for physicians and hospitals we hope to get this information into the hands of the decisionmakers who can find solutions to overcrowding at emergency departments."

CEs are defined as informal, unpaid caregivers, who are providing care to an elder care recipient (often at home), while also engaging in paid employment. This new category of worker, created through numerous demographic changes, such as population aging, and community health care provision realities of the 21st century, has brought attention to the need for support for people providing informal, unpaid care. One strategy is through caregiver-friendly workplace policies (CFWPs). CFWPs, often termed family-friendly workplace policies, are defined as ""deliberate organizational changes - in policies, practices, or the target culture - to reduce work-family conflict and/or support employees' lives outside of
 work"". Current Canadian evidence illustrating the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of CFWPs is needed if Canadian employers are to adopt and integrate CFWPs into their employment practices.

The research questions being addressed are: What are the impacts for employers (economic) and workers (health) of CFWP intervention(s) for full-time caregiver employees (CEs)? What are these impacts for employers and workers of the CFWP intervention(s) in each participating workplace? What contextual factors impact the successful implementation of CFWP intervention(s)?"

The program of research in gender, work and health proposed builds on work underway by the applicant, specific to caregiver friendly workplaces.  Framed within gender relations theory, this research program examines the interface between unpaid caregiving work and paid labour, recognizing that the role strain across these two entities causes ill-health for caregiver employees (CEs).  Although the gender construct is of most importance to this research program, given the gendered nature of unpaid caregiving, the term sex/gender will be employed throughout the research program recognizing the manifestation of the combination of the biological and social elements of sex and gender, respectfully(unless otherwise explicitly operationalized). Six interconnected projects in one of two streams [1.Caregiver Friendly Workplaces (4 projects), and 2.Intersectionality Analysis of Caregiver-Employees (2 projects)] make up the research program and are relevant to three of the identified partners: IGH, IPPH, and CCOHS, given the focus on: sex/gender, work and health (physical, psychosocial and mental); the implementation of workplace interventions which will prevent ill-health and improve the health of CEs, and; the inter-organizational, intersectoral, and inter-jurisdictional approach to addressing CE health.  The program of research will not only build capacity for research on work and health that accounts for sex and gender, given the interdisciplinary training of 3 post-doctoral fellows and 4 graduate students, together with a range of knowledge users and non-academic collaborators, but will simultaneously foster the translation of that research into sex and gender sensitive policies and interventions that improve workers' health via both integrated (iKT) and end-of-project KT strategies"
Poly-substance use trends among COMPASS secondary school students from 2013-2017,"['Williams, Gillian C']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1471.0,400524,"Poly-substance use refers to the current use of two or more substances and is a behaviour with uniquely adverse consequences. While current estimates are unavailable, 2008 data found that 12% of Canadian students in grades 7-12 were current poly-substance users. Since this time, e-cigarette vaping has seen a rise in popularity and recreational cannabis use has been legalized, potentially influencing youth poly-substance trends. The objective of this research was to examine poly-substance use trends among Canadian high school students in the COMPASS study over the past five years. 

The COMPASS study is a large prospective cohort study that collects behavioural health data from 60,000 students per year attending secondary schools (grades 9-12) in Ontario, Quebec, Alberta, British Columbia, and Nunavut. Five years of data were used, starting in 2013. Students reported current (i.e., past 30-day) cigarette, e-cigarette, alcohol, and cannabis use. Poly-substance users were defined as students reporting current use of more than one substance and rates of substance use and poly-substance use were determined each year. 
 
Poly-substance use is on the rise among Canadian high school students and this trend appears to be driven by increases in e-cigarette use. 23% of students reported current use of two or more substances in 2017 compared to 19% in 2013. E-cigarette use has risen from 8% in 2013 to 18% by 2017. Male and Indiegnous students were significantly more likely to report poly-substance use than female and white students respectively. Future policy, practice, and research should acknowledge this growing health behaviour among secondary school students."

This project will foster the development of ethics instruction for public health professionals and researchers, a group for which formal ethics training in Canada is nascent and in high demand. We will survey Canadian schools of public health to map the state of ethics curricula and training resources. The survey findings will be written up into a stimulus paper, to be then used at a day long workshop that will bring together educators in public health ethics from across Canada. This networking event will enable ethics educators to comment on the survey data and share their experiences and thoughts about what is currently and what should be included in public health ethics education. These recommendations will serve as the starting point for structuring a model ethics training curricula (e.g., content, form, innovative teaching approaches) for Canadian public health programmes, which will be disseminated to public health organisations and university programme directors. Through an online discussion platform (including a wiki, forum, and resources), we will provide this newly established network of ethics educators with opportunities to continue to share educational materials, and more importantly, set the foundation for a long-term collaborative environment for improving and innovating in public health ethics education."
Investigating exposure to antibiotics among participants of community Helicobacter pylori projects in Arctic Canada,"['Williams, Kathleen F']",['N/A'],"['Antibiotic Resistance', 'Circumpolar Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Helicobacter Pylori', 'Ics Travel Awards']",2500.0,324528,"Chronic H.pylori infection increases the risk of peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. Residents of Canadian Arctic communities are disproportionately affected by H.pylori-associated diseases. Standard treatment to eliminate H.pylori has poor effectiveness in this region, due in part to antibiotic resistance of local H.pylori strains. As a preliminary step in investigating the influence of exposure to antibiotics on the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant strains, this analysis describes the antibiotic dispensation rate in Canadian Arctic communities and compares it to that of the Edmonton outpatient population.

This analysis used data from projects conducted in 2007-2012 by the CANHelp Working Group in Aklavik, Tuktoyaktuk, Fort McPherson, NT, and Old Crow, YT. Project staff collected data from participants' medical charts on the frequency and type of antibiotic prescriptions for the 5 years preceding project enrolment. Antibiotic dispensation rates in Edmonton for 2010-2013 were estimated from the Alberta Government Interactive Health Data Application.

Chart reviews were completed for 297 participants from the 4 communities. The average number of antibiotic prescriptions per participant for the 5-year period was 4.6 (95%CI:4.1,5.1) and this average was higher among females (5.6; 95%CI:4.8,6.4) compared to males (3.4; 95%CI:2.9,3.9). The antibiotic prescription dispensation rate across communities was 0.94/person-year (95%CI:0.89,1.0). In contrast, the dispensation rate in Edmonton was 0.562/person-year (95%CI:0.561,0.563). The rate difference between the northern communities and Edmonton was 0.38/person-year (95%CI:0.33,0.43).

This analysis estimates a notably higher antibiotic dispensation rate among residents of Arctic communities relative to the Edmonton outpatient population. This may be due in part to the limited availability of diagnostic technology in Arctic communities, leading to more frequent dispensation of antibiotics prior to confirmed diagnosis."

However, the examination of stigma in the context of Canadian veterans suffering from PTSD with SDs has not been undertaken yet. Results from a patient-oriented, community-based project with Canadian veterans with PTSD suggest that stigma is one barrier that can impede successful integration of service dogs in their lives. The proposed project will examine stigma stemming from both significant others (e.g., family, spouses) and the Canadian public related to veterans with SDs, and determine methods for better supporting the integration of AUDEAMUS service dogs in the lives of veterans suffering from PTSD. It will also examine the online training modules of a Canadian-based service dog organization and assess whether they are sufficiently designed to support veterans manage their PTSD symptoms and address issues of stigma."

At a time when most research is focused on the virus itself, the importance of rapid action in providing and evaluating targeted virtual family mental health interventions for high-risk groups is also paramount. Families with children with pre-existing neurodevelopmental disorders that can influence emotional and behaviour regulation (e.g. ADHD, Autism) are at enormous risk for heightened strain and deterioration, due to disruptions in routine, decreases in external social support, and multiple demands on parents. Providing opportunities for mental health support to these families is essential, with options that are flexible and matched to the family's needs.

We engaged parent partners to better understand mental health care needs in this population. We learned of the tremendous lack of programs helping parents address these challenges. Parents voiced strong interest in learning parenting skills to promote their child's behavioural and emotional development. An essential lesson learned during COVID-19 was that families need support options that are flexible and provided in steps that are matched to their needs (stepped-care).

We will also evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the program among children and families to inform future delivery and multi-site trials.
Currently, there is no evidence-based family treatment for children with early serious medical conditions, such as CHD and parents are eager for ways to enhance their child's well-being. Results will evaluate whether I-InTERACT-North can improve parenting and child behaviour in these families and inform future best clinical practices for this population."

There are approximately 16 million individuals who inject drugs worldwide, three million of whom might be living with HIV.  In some countries and regions it is estimated that over 40% of injection drug users are living with HIV.  In Canada, the most recent epidemiological data indicate that injection drug use exposure accounted for 17.7% of new HIV infections (compared with 16% in 2005) and 63% of reported hepatitis C cases. 

HIV and hepatitis viruses can spread rapidly between injection drug users and potentially to the wider community through sexual transmission.  To limit the harms associated with drug use and reduce the transmission of HIV and hepatitis, there is a need for effective and coordinated policy and program responses.  Harm reduction is a very practical response to drug use for those people who are unable, unwilling or not yet able or ready to stop using drugs.  The goal of harm reduction is to limit adverse health outcomes of drug use and to prevent the HIV and Hepatitis B/C without first requiring that people abstain from drug use.

Attempts to address maternal and child health (MCH) remain ineffective; the UN's Millennium Development Goals related to MCH were the furthest from being met by the 2015 deadline. Efforts to achieve these goals have been hobbled by 2 problems: 1) health outcomes are strongly influenced by culture, yet most research on this issue is conducted with no understanding of the cultural context from which they arise; 2) challenges such as poverty affect a wide array of physiological systems, causing diverse health problems, yet most research on MCH focuses on 1 health outcome at a time. In collaboration with multiple stakeholders and building on work we completed in Nicaragua in 2015, in a longitudinal study we will address the 1st problem via participant observation and the 2nd problem via the pooling of multiple measures of physiological function which capture the cumulative dysregulation of biological systems confronting chronic environmental challenges - a novel approach. We do so in Nicaragua's poorest region as its culture of machismo deprives women of resources and these communities, in common with Canadian First Nations & Inuit, are experiencing a rapid increase in chronic disease. We have already put our 2015 findings to use: working with a Nicaraguan NGO, we implemented effective interventions to address maternal depression. The proposed study's findings will inform further, evidence-based, culturally-relevant interventions to address this significant public health issue.  Here, I seek to fund a 5-day workshop with Nicaraguan stakeholders to disseminate findings from the 2015 research and to design a longitudinal study to better understand the health of and challenges faced by these women and children."
Prevalence of Adolescent Dating Aggression: A Meta-Analysis,"['Wincentak, Katherine J']",['N/A'],"['Adolescent', 'Aggression', 'Dating Violence', 'Development', 'Meta-Analysis', 'Prevalence', 'Prevention', 'Psychology', 'Romantic Relationships', 'Social']",17500.0,200245,"Aggression between adolescent dating partners is an alarming public health issue. Dating aggression is associated with serious physical and mental health consequences, including physical injuries requiring medical attention, depression, substance use, eating disorders, school failures, sexual risk taking, early pregnancy and suicidality. According to prevention experts, efforts aimed at eliminating dating aggression require a clear understanding of the base rate prevalence of this phenomenon. However, prevalence rates have been found to vary widely, with reports that between 10 to 80 percent of adolescents experience aggression within their romantic relationships. Given the divergent findings reported within the body of adolescent dating aggression research and the fact that this literature has not been synthesized, the goal of this study will be to conduct  a meta-analysis which will characterize the prevalence of males and females victimization and perpetration of aggression within early, mid, and late adolescent dating relationships. It is hypothesized that the prevalence rates of dating aggression will be 1) higher in studies that use a definition of aggression that includes verbal or emotional aggression, 2) equal between boys and girls in the mid adolescent age groups and 3) higher in samples from areas where there is a high risk of exposure to community violence.  A more comprehensive understanding of the prevalence of adolescent dating aggression will inform researchers, educational partners, community agencies and front line workers in their prevention efforts addressing this pressing public health issue."
From Active to Healthy Ageing.

It is also one of our greatest challenges."" - World Health Organization (2002)
The active and successful ageing paradigm as well as the anti-aging movement reflect the sociocultural triumphs and challenges of ageing we face today (cf. Katz, 2001/2002). However, the World Health Organization's Active Ageing Policy (2002), the national health policies of Canada as well as the provincial and the local government in this country with their Age-friendly action plans not just reflect these developments; they are also constructing a 'futurity' for ageing and around ageing populations. Therefore, it is important to understand how they construct ageing in these programs. What kind of an ageing person do they imagine? Which role does the state play? To approach these questions I will use
Butler and Foucault as a theoretical framework. I ask how the program and especially the measures through power/knowledge of institutions and discourses create ageing and ageing populations. I scrutinize the performativity of the programs."
The Impact of Early Childhood Education and Care Policies on Health Outcomes in Adolescence,"['Windle, Sarah B']",['N/A'],"['Child Health', 'Early Childhood Education And Care', 'Policy Evaluation']",105000.0,442265,"Background:
Early childhood education and care (ECEC) programs are part of large-scale social policy reforms in high-income countries, however surprisingly few studies having evaluated their impact, particularly regarding inequalities and non-academic outcomes (e.g., health and behavioural outcomes) in adolescence.

Objectives:
1) To evaluate the impact of reforms which increased assess to ECEC between 1995-2008 on health and behavioural outcomes in adolescence, as well as socioeconomic inequalities within these endpoints; and
2) To inform the optimal design of ECEC policies by examining how impacts on adolescent health and behavioural outcomes are related to other policy domains, including the quality and governance of the ECEC program.

Methods:
A database containing systematically-cataloged ECEC policies will be used to identify natural experiments which expanded ECEC participation in high-income countries between 1995 and 2008. We will estimate the impact of these reforms on adolescent health and behavioural outcomes, using linked microdata from the World Health Organization's Health Behaviour in School-aged Children survey. We will then assess the impact of indicators of ECEC quality and governance on these outcomes.

Significance:
Evidence concerning the impact of large-scale ECEC reforms is severely limited. This research will address this gap and enable the identification of policy characteristics that have the potential to improve adolescent health and well-being, as well as to reduce social inequalities in health outcomes."

The City of Vancouver is a primary partner and knowledge user in this research, as they wish to understand how their investment influences the physical activity of residents. 

This analysis uses the baseline data to describe how active older adults are in their daily travel. We used cutting edge measurement methods to capture location-based physical activity (GPS, accelerometry). In our sample of 120 older adults living in a walkable setting, transit trips resulted in a comparable amount of walking to walking trips, due to walking to, from, and between bus stops.  Overall, transportation-related physical activity made a substantial contribution towards meeting daily physical activity recommendations, and importantly, transportation-related physical activity did not appear to substitute for other types of physical activity. These results suggest that both walking and public transit are healthy travel choices for older adults."

In addition to the health benefits from cycling, it is a travel mode that is accessible across all ages and economic conditions.  However, cycling has low and inequitable uptake in North America: rates are much lower than in European cities (1-2% of trips, versus 15-40% of trips); and cyclists are typically male, aged 20-40 years - a contrast with the even spread across age and gender in Europe.
Changing population-wide travel patterns, and particularly those in vulnerable segments, requires innovative policies. One such example is public bikeshare. These programs increase access to bicycles by providing stations throughout a city where bicycles can be rented for one-way travel at a minimal cost. These programs are on the rise. Many cities have seen enthusiastic uptake and increases in general cycling after the introduction of a program.  
Vancouver is launching a public bikeshare. Vancouver's climate, culture, and bike route system provides a strong foundation for success, but there are concerns given the all-ages helmet legislation, long debated as a barrier to uptake of cycling and a threat to public bikeshare success worldwide.  
This proposal will examine the impact of Vancouver's bikeshare on travel and health outcomes in the general population, in program users, and within key population segments.  We will conduct telephone surveys, before and after the intervention, and focus groups, to capture changes in travel patterns and physical activity and to understand the barriers to cycling and bikeshare use within different demographic groups.    
The outcomes of this project will be three-fold: evidence on whether this public bikeshare program can induce a shift in travel across diverse social groups, evidence on any positive health and transportation impacts the program may yield, and identification of barriers to uptake for non-traditional cycling groups."

However, research and surveillance on the impacts of built environment changes remains challenging due to huge data gaps in measuring ""healthy"" environments. 
   In the realm of active transportation, the new Canadian Active Living Environment (Can-ALE) is a national dataset with measures on how supportive communities are for walking and public transit. But there is no analogous data on bicycling environments, despite the fact that bicycling is the primary travel mode for nearly 12% of commuters in some cities (e.g., Victoria, Census 2016) and the fastest growing travel mode nationally. Further, cities from coast to coast are announcing multi-million dollar investments in bicycling infrastructure networks (Victoria in 2016, Halifax in 2019). 
   In this project, we aim to develop measures for bicycling infrastructure for all communities in Canada, at the neighbourhood level. Specifically, we will: develop a dataset with measures of the bicycling environment; validate the measures using existing national administrative datasets, including Can-ALE and Census bicycle journey-to-work data.
   Our work will directly advance healthy cities intervention research in Canada by providing standardized metrics that can facilitate multi-city studies, as well as those that track change over time. These new measures will be fundamental for evaluating the impacts of future bicycling-related policy and built environment interventions on population health and healthy equity.

My research projects have been developed with, by, and for stakeholders across health, transportation, and planning sectors, and reflect both urgent needs and timely opportunities. I have built meaningful partnerships locally, nationally, and internationally with partners outside academia who are influential in municipal policy and planning in Canada. Through this, I am now regularly invited to sit at decision-making tables, to speak to health and equity impacts of urban form decisions, to design studies to assess infrastructure and programmatic interventions, and to inform the plans and actions of my partners and broader stakeholders.
My publications have been widely cited in the academic literature, with the novel approaches (e.g., case-crossover studies), metrics (e.g., Bike Score) and data (e.g., Strava) I use picked up and replicated in other cities and settings. Importantly, my research has been put to action, directly informing municipal transportation and planning policies on how to create environments that are safe, enjoyable, and inclusive.

It aims to strengthen partnerships and knowledge exchange between urban researchers, professionals, advocates looking to unlock the equity-promoting potential of sustainable transportation interventions across Canada. The Knowledge Hub will: 

1.Document equity frameworks in Canadian cities;  
2.Capture lessons learned and best practices on using equity frameworks for sustainable transportation;
3.Establish a common research and action agenda for integrating equity in the planning and implementation of sustainable transportation interventions in Canada.

Key activities proposed in the grant include an environmental scan to document equity frameworks in cities; interviews with planning staff from jurisdictions identified as leading in the transportation equity space; and case studies summarizing lessons learned, best practices, and growing pains. The project will close with a summit gathering Knowledge Hub members and leading experts to strengthen partnerships, discuss case studies, and establish a common agenda for integrating of equity in transportation planning."

The smart cities movement-fueled by great financial investment, and political and public interest-is a driving force of urban transformation with immense potential to impact population health. A smart city aspires to improve city life using better (and often bigger) data and technology. But will smart cities actually lead to healthier citizens? The paradox of 'smart' solutions is the potential for unintended consequences that may instead damage health.
Using Infrastructure Canada's $75M Smart Cities Challenge competition as a testing ground, the overall goal of this planning grant is to convene Canadian researchers and citizen- and city-partners to move forward in optimizing health and equity in city policy making. Through case studies and a planning symposium, our objectives are: 1. to uncover how health and equity are considered in smart city policies, map pathways to health outcomes, and craft plausible policy implementation scenarios; and 2. to formalize an interdisciplinary, intersectoral team interested in modelling health impacts and creating a decision support platform for healthy city policy making.

Our vision is a collaborative research initiative to specify policies that have the greatest potential for the healthy cities agenda, and track their impacts on health behaviours and outcomes. In this planning grant (year 1) we will scope policies that may impact health, and inventory the extent of policy action in cities across the country. In the following 5-7 years, we will refine the inventory, collaborate with stakeholders to: identify and model health impacts of select policy scenarios; and to design and conduct studies to assess the health impacts of policy actions.

However, in population health research, measures of gentrification are typically limited to socio-demographic and housing shifts, such as rising property values and increases in household income and educational attainment. By solely focusing on socio-demographic changes, we fail to understand the built environment and policy interventions that may have ignited gentrification. The Gentrification, Urban Interventions, and Equity (GENUINE) project will develop gentrification-related measures and spatial datasets to enable researchers and practitioners to assess how changing neighbourhood environments impacts population health, and aid Canadian cities in creating healthy, equitable, and inclusive cities. The proposed research leverages existing data from Statistics Canada, Canadian Urban Environment Health Research Consortium, Enhanced Points of Interest database, and the CIHR-funded INTerventions, Research, and Action in Cities Team to: 1) Develop new measures of changes in neighbourhood greenness and commercial amenities (food outlets, retail businesses) over time in Canadian cities; 2) Analyze inequities in these changes over time and space; 3) Identify how and where these changes relate to gentrification patterns; and 4) Apply these measures in a case study on well-being in Montréal, Canada. With COVID-19 we see cities changing faster than ever before, and policy makers' attention towards healthy cities is only expanding.

Sparking Interjurisdictional Action: Building Synergies To Accelerate Active Transportation Uptake Across Metro Vancouver,"['Winters, Meghan']",['N/A'],"['Active Transportation', 'Health Equity', 'Policy', 'Population Health', 'Public Space']",68065.0,499973,"This proposal aims to build interjurisdictional synergies to accelerate the creation of high-quality active transportation infrastructure in Metro Vancouver. Our team brings together decision-makers and senior staff in local (City of Burnaby), regional (TransLink, the regional transportation authority), provincial (BC Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure) agencies, and public health (Vancouver Coastal Health). 
The policy context for active transportation and public space is complicated. Municipalities are responsible for much of the infrastructure within their borders, but not all. Regional routes need consistency across borders. Most projects require funding from higher levels of government. And while at first pass levels of government appear to be aligned strategically with plans for rapid shifts to active transportation supported by a public health case, the track record in the region shows interjurisdictional and intersectoral rubs are impeding timely progress.
To respond to this issue, our team has coalesced with a goal to highlight the interjurisdictional rubs in funding, planning, designing, and maintaining high-quality public spaces and active transportation infrastructure, and spark action to accelerate processes that can support widespread uptake in who walks, rolls, and cycles in the region.   
Drawing inspiration from insights gained at the Copenhagen workshop, we are organizing engagement sessions and a summit event. These activities will result in new alliances between players within and across municipalities, through levels of government, as well as intersectorally (health, advocacy, civil society, research). Outcomes of this work will be a locally-shaped research and action plan that facilitates the effective implementation of public space and active transportation interventions that support healthy, equitable, and sustainable cities, and learnings to share with the healthy cities research and practice community throughout Canada."

The 2SLGBTQ+ young people experience worse mental health outcomes. However, research in both of these areas is limited by its homogenization of 2SLGBTQ+ communities. Colonialism, racism, migration, ableism, and poverty, among other systems of power, undoubtedly shape 2SLGBTQ+ young peoples' experiences of gender-based violence, though comprehensive intersectional data is minimal. In addition, there is an absence of analysis on the relationships between experiences of public gender-based violence and mental health and well-being. 

To address these gaps, Wisdom2Action (W2A) aims to actively engage and empower 2SLGBTQ+ young people and 2SLGBTQ+ serving organizations in community-based participatory research. Together, we will (1) strengthen intersectional knowledge of 2SLGBTQ+ young peoples' experiences with street harassment and other forms of public gender-based violence in Canada; (2) analyze the impacts of this violence on 2SLGBTQ+ young peoples' mental health and wellbeing; and (3) use this data to inform and improve the implementation of Strengthening Access for Everyone Under the Rainbow (SAFER): a national, community-based, WAGE-funded intervention W2A is carrying out from 2021-2024."
"A Multi-level Analysis of Functional, Social and Psychological Multimorbidity Resilience and Aging","['Wister, Andrew V']","['Lear, Scott A', 'Mackey, Dawn C', 'Rosin, Miriam P', 'Schuurman, Nadine C']","['Multimorbidity, Aging, Resilience']",70000.0,352946,"The Canadian population is aging rapidly as the baby boomers move into their elder years and as longevity continues to increase. This means that there will be a significant proportion of people living with chronic illnesses. Multimorbidity is the condition under which an individual has been diagnosed with two or more concurrent chronic diseases and it afflicts approximately two-thirds of the older (65 years and older) population of Canada. This research will address why some older individuals adapt to the adversity associated with the presence of multimorbidity better than others, termed multimorbidity resilience. Specifically, we will explore three types of multimorbidity resilience: 1) functional resilience -- focusing on physical disability and daily living functioning; 2) social resilience -- focusing on social isolation and community participation; and 3) psychological resilience -- focusing on psychological distress, depression and life satisfaction (positive). After developing indices of the three multimorbidity resilience types, we will identify protective and risk factors. In addition, this research will produce maps of multimorbidity clusters by gender, age group and socio-economic status across Canada. 
Recognizing that the causes and consequences of multimorbidity resilience will help to understand how older people with more than one chronic illness (and specific combinations) age well in the face of the illness complications, and implications for health care utilization. Most work in this area has investigated the deleterious aspects of multimorbidity; however, this research will identify factors that promote positive aging under these illness conditions. In so doing, it will add to our understanding of coping with illness in later life and how people adapt to these circumstances. This information will help to develop programs, policies and services that will foster improved independent living and functioning for those with multimorbidity."
Cancer survival of First Nations and Métis adults in Canada: follow-up of the 1991 census cohort,"['Withrow, Diana']",['N/A'],"['Aboriginal Health', 'Administrative Data', 'Cancer Survival', 'Health Inequalities', 'Population-Based Research', 'Record Linkage']",105000.0,245851,"Past studies have found that aboriginal peoples were at decreased risk of being diagnosed with cancer compared to the general population. These studies and others have also shown, however, that their risk of cancer is increasing over time and some findings suggest that once diagnosed with cancer, aboriginal people are less likely to survive than non-aboriginal people. Overall, the patterns of cancer in aboriginal peoples appear to be different from those in the general Canadian population. These population-level patterns are challenging to study, mainly because it is difficult to identify aboriginal people in administrative health databases. As a result of this challenge and others, there exists little research about the burden of cancer in these groups, despite the fact that it is among the top three causes of death in First Nations and Métis. A recent merging of three national databases has provided an opportunity to, for the first time, examine cancer survival in Canadian First Nations and Métis nationwide. Using linked data from the 1991 Canadian long-form Census, the Canadian Mortality Database and the Canadian Cancer Database, we intend to fulfill three objectives: 1) to describe cancer survival among First Nations and Métis adults in Canada; 2) to identify trends in survival (A) over time and (B) by broad geographical region; and 3) to compare the above to patterns and trends in non-aboriginal people. The proposed study will provide First Nations and Métis groups and their cancer control partners with a description of their cancer survival patterns and a metric by which to determine how they compare to each other and to the general population. In so doing, the proposed research aims to generate the information necessary to plan and provide effective, culturally-appropriate cancer control programs."

Epidemiological studies have demonstrated associations between sensory loss and many aspects of cognitive, mental, physical and social health including dementia, depression, falls, social isolation, lower earning potential, limitations in activities of daily living, greater dependence on the informal caregiving network, increased use of formal health care resources, lower quality of life and even mortality. Despite (and perhaps contributing to) these findings, adult-onset HL, VL and DL are frequently under-diagnosed and untreated especially in individuals with compromised cognition. The disability resulting from sensory loss may be affected by interactions between factors in all five domains of the World Health Organization's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health framework. How these personal, environmental, physical, activity and participation factors interact to influence the disability associated with HL, VL and DL will be the focus of our analyses of data collected through the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA).

The 'early' involvement of people impacted by NT developments in the discussions around the socio-compatible use of NTs is seen as important by many. The FUTUREBODY project aims to explore societal and cultural changes induced by NT developments focusing on three NTs: (1) cochlear implants, (2) deep brain stimulation and (3) brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. The Canadian team concentrates on the contribution of health professionals and disabled students, two under-researched groups, to NT development discussions. Nurses, social workers, occupational therapists and speech-language pathologists/audiologists are health professionals that encounter clients using NTs. As such NT development discussions impact their professional practice. Aim 1 is to better understand the usefulness of lifelong learning processes in place for the health professionals mentioned to learn about NT advancements and their impact in a timely fashion so that the health professionals can contribute in a meaningful way to discussions on the socio-compatible use of NTs. Disabled people are often early adopters of technologies and the first that have to deal with issues raised by technologies which makes disabled people important knowledge producers not only as NT users but also as researchers. Aim 2 is to gain insight from disabled students on NTs and their impact and whether they ever thought of performing research on NTs and their impact. The Canadian project will use podcasts, videocasts, online and face to face workshops, movie screenings, facebook and twitter and a blog page to make their project accessible to the public. The results are seen to be useful to strengthen the life-long learning process of health professionals and the research landscape around NTs which in turn is seen to enhance future discussions of the socio-compatible use of NTs."

In Canada we are in a unique position to study this issue within the largest study of aging conducted in Canada, the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA). As part of the baseline interview in the CLSA, a set of 4 veteran identifier questions was asked at baseline of all 51,000 participants. The questions asked about the branch of the military (e.g. army, navy, air force), when the military service took place, and the length of time in the military. Participants also provided detailed information on their physical and mental health. Of the 51,000 participants, 4500 self reported as Veterans and military service was reported to be as early as 1941.  The goal of this project is to describe the baseline physical and mental health of the CLSA participants who self-identified as veterans.  It is of interest to examine any differences in health status across branches of service as well as in relation to the duration of service and time since release from the military.

Do prior life experiences, such as having served in the military, play a role in the development of resiliency at older ages? These are questions we will explore in this research project. Several U.S. studies have highlighted the resilience of Veterans, but we have not found any comparable studies in Canada. Resilience is often characterized by personal growth following stressful experience(s) and the development of coping skills (e.g., mental, emotional, and behavioural flexibility) in the face of adversity. Sometimes referred to as post-traumatic growth, this resiliency has been suggested to occur in Veterans following trauma and/or military-related experiences (in some cases, decades after military service). It is well accepted that the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have disproportionately affected different population groups (e.g., older adults). Research on Veterans specifically suggests features of both resilience and vulnerability in response to the pandemic. Prior military trauma may translate to difficulty coping with the pandemic (e.g., due to increased social isolation), but may also reveal the resiliency of older Veterans during challenging times. In the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA), more than 4,000 participants self-identified as Veterans. Using data from the CLSA collected over time, we will examine psychological resilience in older Veterans in Canada for the first time, how resilience manifests over time, and how it relates to pandemic experiences and health states."
Caring Over the Lifecycle: the Roles of Families and Welfare States Today and Into the Future (WELLCARE),"['Wolfson, Michael C']",['N/A'],"['Caring Responsiblities', 'Cross-National Comparisons', 'Demography', 'Disability / Functional Limitations', 'Dynamic Microsimulation', 'Interdisciplinary', 'Intergenerational Equity', 'Life Course', 'Policy Projections', 'Population Ageing']",131943.0,434324,"With ageing populations, there is growing concern about how societies can best meet their caring responsibilities, which are highest for children and the elderly.  They are met by combinations of informal care provided by family member, and formal care either privately purchased or from publicly-funded government programs.  This research proposal compares the ways formal and informal care are provided in four countries - Spain, Austria, UK, and Canada.  With careful cross-national comparative analysis, we can learn about alternative approaches to meeting caring responsibilities.

A 2019 analysis for Canada showed that the increasing share of the population at higher ages combined with continuing increases in life expectancy and declines in fertility rates could create major tensions by 2050 for meeting their care needs.  Still, the complement of population ageing is a decline in the proportion of children, giving rise to a what some are calling a ""demographic dividend"".  But will a decline in caring responsibilities for children be able to offset increasing needs for formal and informal care for the elderly?  

The core of the research will build on detailed population surveys in each country, and extend current computer simulation models to project scenarios by which each country can meet its caring needs.  Phrases like the ""gray tsunami"" and ""demodoom"" paint a very negative picture where the baby boom cohort impose heavy burdens on future working age cohorts.  Thus, a central aspect of the analysis of both formal and informal care services will be an assessment of inter-generational equity.  However, there is tremendous variation across individuals within each generation, so the analysis will also draw on the survey data and simulation models to assess intra-generational patterns of caring from a full life course perspective. 

The results will include new insights and actionable policy ideas on how best to meet Canada's caring responsibilities."

In British Columbia alone, the number of compensation claims for workstress has increased more than 35 times from 1987 to 2006. This has resulted in almost 500,000 days of work lost and costing just over $87 million in compensation.  Heart disease claims have followed a similar pattern, resulting in 40,000 lost work days and costing $50 million in compensation.  When considering the additional costs on the health care system, the effects of workstress are enormous. 

Although stress has been identified as a potential risk factor for heart disease, there is little known about the mechanisms which cause it. By understanding the biological pathways, it will help in developing effective ways of combating stress in the workplace. 
Our study will be focused on paramedics because it is considered to be one of the most stressful professions due to the difficult work schedule and frequent exposure to human tragedy. We will be gathering data about their work activity; surveying them about their perceived stress; and measuring their biological responses to stress and subclinical indicators of heart disease. 

Our research will use the newest innovations in measuring biological responses. This will give us an advantage over previous studies by allowing us to study more of the processes which may cause heart disease and how they interact. 

The finding that workstress is a heart disease risk factor has considerable public health significance because it has the potential to impact the 17 million people currently working in Canada. The effects of workstress are magnified when people bring the stress back into their homes, affecting their family life.  By finding out how stress causes heart disease, we may be able to develop better ways of reducing the effects and improve the quality of life for many."

These children are extremely vulnerable to illnesses and infections, meaning that any time IC children or their family members leave their home, the child's life is in jeopardy. Families of IC children encounter many challenges and inequities, such as financial difficulties, poorer physical and psychological health, social isolation, and marginalization. In spite of the large number of IC children, we have little understanding of what it is like to be a family of an IC child. Moreover, we have limited understanding of these families' experiences during the current COVID-19 crisis from the emergence of the virus, to the various peaks and waves, to the new and changing circumstances in which they find themselves trying to adjust as part of their everyday lives. The goal of this 4-year patient-oriented study is to understand and document the lived experience of families of IC children during COVID-19. Children under the age of 18 who are IC (primary or secondary) and their families (including parents, caregivers, siblings) across Canada will be invited to take part in the study. Multiple data sources are planned to include individual and family interviews (conducted in English and French), and digital story-telling. Short-term, the study will result in advanced knowledge on the experiences of families of IC children during COVID-19 including insights into their well-being has been affected by the pandemic. Recommendations to improve healthcare and social supports and services that improve their well-being for future waves and/or crises will be identified. Long-term, the work emerging from this research program will be used to inform patient-oriented service delivery and outcomes nationwide for this currently underserved and vulnerable population, with implications for children who are IC and their families residing in other contexts, important for future pandemics and other public health crises."

Despite recent warnings from public health officials regarding potential harmful impacts due to the convergence of COVID-19 and seasonal influenza, along with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), particularly for the very young, parents' support for vaccinating their children varies. Influenza vaccination coverage for Canadian children and adults remains low, and while over 80% of children aged 12-17 years and adults have been vaccinated with at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, it is of concern that parents' and youth's willingness to get vaccinated is not universal, given the ongoing outbreaks of COVID-19 variants. Considering parental perceptions of vaccines directly influences the vaccination status of their child(ren), we need to approach the study of COVID-19 and influenza vaccination rates and decisions within the context of the family unit.

Families of children with disabilities encounter many challenges and inequities, such as economic and social disparities, poorer health and social exclusion. COVID-19 has further exacerbated the inequities experienced by these families who have faced disproportionately greater challenges throughout COVID-19. Moreover, the pandemic has impacted how children with disabilities receive care including a greater emphasis on the provision of virtual care. Families of children with disabilities have experienced delays in their ability to access both healthcare and social care including rehabilitation. This lack of access to care is even more pronounced for Black, Indigenous and People of Colour families and those who are lower income. Even with improvements in the pandemic, it is unlikely that care will return to its pre-pandemic normal. To better address the indirect and wider health impacts of COVID-19 on families of children with disabilities, needed is research that will result in an equitable and targeted model of care for these families. This study aims to develop a model of care using an equity lens that ameliorates the indirect and wider health impacts of COVID-19 on families of children living with disabilities. Families from Manitoba (MB) will participate in family interviews.

Exploring the cognitive underpinnings of hoarding,"['Woody, Sheila R']","['Bogod, Nicholas M', 'Bartels, Daniel', 'Handy, Todd C', 'Menon, Mahesh']","['Attention', 'Cognition', 'Decision-Making', 'Diminishing Marginal Value', 'Endowment Effect', 'Hoarding', 'Judgment', 'Memory']",500424.0,320577,"Hoarding disorder is a newly defined diagnostic category that affects as many as 1.5 million Canadians. Although hoarding appears on the surface (and perhaps on TV shows) to be a simple problem of poor housekeeping, the disorder involves substantial functional impairment including severe social isolation and inability to sustain minimal standards of home maintenance. Seniors and low-income renters are particularly vulnerable to threat of eviction and accidents in the home. The hallmark symptom of hoarding disorder is extreme emotional distress about, and avoidance of, discarding objects most people would let go of. As a result, the home becomes too full to use some or all of the rooms for their intended purpose. Possessions in the home become extremely disorganized, with important (e.g., passport) and unimportant (e.g., out-dated sales flyers) items mixed together. Intervention for hoarding is complex, and the most effective intervention tested thus far has shown only modest effects despite an enormous investment of resources. 

Limited understanding of the cognitive processes involved in decisions to acquire and discard possessions in turn limits the degree to which treatment can effectively target these processes. This research will determine the cognitive underpinnings of two key features of hoarding: excessive valuing of objects and extreme disorganization of the home. Five studies are proposed to investigate aspects of cognitive functioning as they relate to hoarding behaviour. In relation to the psychology of ownership, we focus on attention and memory as well as specific types of judgment and decision-making. We also examine whether hoarding involves deficits in executive functioning (e.g., concept formation, impulse control). The results will directly impact the development of more efficacious and cost-effective approaches to treatment as well as provide clues into the neuroscience behind hoarding and related disorders."

It explained that unhealthy behaviours, obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes are becoming so much more common in young Canadian women that heart disease will explode in the next generation. Health care providers use ""risk assessment tools"" to predict their patients' chances of having a heart attack or stroke - patients whose chances are high can then be offered help to improve their lifestyle or given medications, for example to control their blood pressure. Common risk assessment tools, however, need measurements such as cholesterol levels that are recommended only for older women and do not include pregnancy characteristics although previous studies have suggested they could be useful. Our aim in this study is to develop risk assessment tools that can be used in young women for cardiovascular disease (heart disease and stroke), and for two conditions that often precede its development, diabetes and hypertension (high blood pressure). The tools will be based on pregnancy information and other risk factors like body weight and smoking. We propose to use two databases in Nova Scotia for this study. The first is the Atlee Perinatal Database that contains detailed information on over 90,000 mothers and their pregnancies since 1988. The second is health care records that will be used to identify occurrences of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and hypertension in these women. The mathematical equations, which combine lifestyle and pregnancy information, that best forecast a woman's chances of developing these conditions will be determined. Our approach to achieving our aim could not be done elsewhere as time efficiently and with as high quality data.

The participants will be Nova Scotian women enrolled in the Atlantic Partnership for Tomorrow's Health (A.PATH) cohort between 2009 and 2010. Each A.PATH participant had measurements of body composition taken by a nurse, provided a blood sample, and completed a questionnaire about health conditions and lifestyle characteristics. Health service utilization data will provide complementary data about obesity-related health conditions. Past pregnancy information for each participant will be derived from the Atlee Perinatal Database, a provincial database in existence since 1980 that has detailed clinical information for all deliveries.  The depth of the information collected will ensure that this project will be an important contribution to this underdeveloped research agenda. The knowledge gained will enhance the understanding of the development of chronic health conditions that affect so many women in Canada and could improve the identification of high risk women so that they may take preventive precautions."
Getting to Work: Development of an Evidence-Informed Educational Program for Professionals to Promote Labour Force Participation for People Living with HIV in Canada,"['Worthington, Catherine A', 'Mangion, Martine']","[""O'Brien, Kelly K"", 'Rueda, Sergio', 'Salbach, Nancy', 'Solomon, Patricia E']","['Community-Based Research', 'Hiv/Aids', 'Knowledge Translation', 'Labour Force Participation', 'Problem-Based Learning', 'Qualitative Methods']",126953.0,193079,"Participation in the work force is an important contributor to health. It provides support for the necessities of life through income, but also can increase psychological health by providing daily life structure and social linkages. In order to better understand work-related issues around labour force participation for people living with HIV (PHAs), we have been working for the past 2 years (with funding from CIHR) to develop a conceptual framework that includes barriers, facilitators, strategies, supports and potential outcomes of labour force participation for PHAs. Our team includes university researchers and decision-maker partners from the Canadian Working Group on HIV and Rehabilitation (CWGHR). Our work is guided by an advisory committee including PHAs.
In this Knowledge to Action project, we will assess if and how the different stakeholder groups (including AIDS service organizations (ASOs), employers, insurers, policy makers, vocational rehabilitation workers and PHAs) use the framework (objective 1). We will also use the conceptual framework to develop an educational program to better prepare ASO staff and vocational rehabilitation workers to assist PHAs to (re)enter the workforce (objective 2). This will be done by first investigating the theoretical frameworks that have informed vocational rehabilitation programs, and developing a program logic model (a map of likely pathways of change) with our national advisory committee. We will then use the conceptual framework and logic model to design a series of scenarios to use in training ASO and vocational rehabilitation workers. Through focus groups, we will see how useful ASO and vocational rehabilitation workers think the scenarios are and will also investigate barriers that may exist to using the new knowledge from the scenarios. We will also consult with professionals that work in other episodic disability areas (e.g., mental health) to see whether our educational program would be useful in their fields."

At the graduate level, PHSP offers a Master of Public Health (MPH), as well as a Graduate Diploma in Public Health. The goal of the MPH program is to prepare graduates who demonstrate excellence in public health knowledge and skills as public health policy makers and practitioners. The MPH program was designed to adhere to the Guidelines for MPH Programs in Canada, and includes a core curriculum focussing on recognized national and provincial public health competencies. In addition, students select one of three areas of focus:  Indigenous Peoples' Health, Social Policy, or Public Health Nursing. All MPH students are required to complete a 450-hour practicum and a culminating project, report and presentation. 
Courses are delivered in an accessible format: the majority of courses are delivered on-line, and there are three strategically placed on-campus components (a gateway orientation week, an area of focus block-intensive course in term 3, and a culminating student conference). MPH students may complete the program full-time in 2 years, or part-time in 3 years. 
Our students study in their communities across the country. Some undertake practicum in their home communities, while others travel for practicum to learn through practice in new environments. The Dr. James Rossiter Master's of Public Health (MPH) Practicum Awards would allow PHSP to support and recognize some of our outstanding MPH students in their practicum work, and assist in contributing to the supply of highly qualified public health professionals for communities across Canada."

The original HEADS UP! CBR catalyst study highlighted the need to better understand the experience of diverse PHAs who have cognitive concerns and HAND, how PHAs navigate their service experiences, as well as experiences of service providers in different settings, in order to develop tools to support diverse PHAs, caregivers, and providers to address the health-related challenges of cognitive issues and HAND.
Our goals in the HEADS UP! 2 study are to use CBR methods to examine the experiences of up to 60 persons living with HIV concerned with cognitive functioning and their caregivers in 3 sites (ON, AB, BC), as well as the perspectives and experiences of 16 clinical and community-based service providers on delivering care to PHAs (in ON, AB, BC, QB) with neurocognitive issues. We seek full engagement and capacity-building for all team members, including a group of peer research associates (PRAs) who will contribute to the team through study design, data analysis, and knowledge transfer and exchange.

"Should I tell my employer I have a disability? Understanding communication, decision making, support and accommodation processes in the workplace among adults living with chronic disabling conditions","['Woticky, Gemma E']",['N/A'],"['Accommodation', 'Communication', 'Disability', 'Employment']",105000.0,416964,"On average, Canadians spend over one-third of their lives at work. Employment has been found to provide a sense of purpose and well-being. Not having paid work has been found to be related to poorer health, social and financial disadvantages. In Canada, less than half of people with a disability are employed.  The most common and costly health conditions resulting in disabilities are often invisible and unpredictable -  depression, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, HIV, cancer, etc. Privacy legislation protects workers and prevents employers from asking for medical diagnoses or symptoms. Research also finds that workers are often unwilling to reveal their health and support needs at work due to fear of job or promotion loss or discrimination. The overall aim of this research is to enable individuals with a disability to remain working by seeking a better understanding of workplace communication decisions (to discuss a disability or not) and support. Objective 1: to examine worker and employers' perspectives of the challenges people living with a disability face at work, whether and how they communicate and seek support at work, and how these decisions may be shaped by different types of disability (e.g. physical and mental health), different job types, and personal factors like age and gender. Objective 2: to identify whether communication decisions, type of disability, and personal and job factors are related to outcomes at work such as job attendance, stress, productivity, and workplace relationships. This will be carried out in two studies 1) will use in-depth interviews with workers and employers and 2) will draw on the findings from the interviews to design a novel questionnaire that will be given to a larger group of people. Understanding how the nature of disability, communication decision making and support seeking in the workplace relate to gaining and maintaining employment can inform new workplace policies and practices to help people with disabilities."
Signs with a side of fries: The influence of outdoor advertising on visits to retail food outlets by adolescents,"['Wray, Alexander']",['N/A'],"['Adolescents', 'Advertising', 'Exposure', 'Food', 'Health Geography', 'Health Promotion', 'Ics Travel Awards']",1500.0,418163,"Consumption of food and beverages high in fat, sodium, and free sugars have been linked to a wide range of chronic health conditions including heart disease, hypertension, cancers, and diabetes. The diets of Canadian adolescents unfortunately contain many of these foods and beverages in large quantities. These consumption patterns result in lower academic performance, negative mood, and increase the risk of chronic disease in later life. While socioeconomic factors are recognized to influence adolescent diet behaviour, little research has explored the information environment's effects. Preliminary research would suggest the availability of outdoor advertising in a local area has an effect on the dietary choices of adolescents, though little explores the mechanisms that link exposure to outdoor advertising and dietary choices. Using a novel spatiotemporal approach, this study leverages individual-level spatial data collected through a smartphone application (SmartAPPetite) to track exposure to outdoor advertising, and subsequent visits to food sources by adolescents in the London, Ontario, Canada region. This study uncovers the information-based exposure mechanisms that inform adolescent decision-making related to food and beverage consumption. Socio-demographic features, specific elements of advertisements, nutritional content, proximity to retail food outlets, and the magnitudes of exposure to advertisements are linked to the volume and types of food outlets visited by adolescents. The results from this study could be used to understand the information mechanisms that drive teenage food and beverage consumption. In addition, this study could inform government regulation of food and beverage advertising targeted at youth."
Supporting the Journey to Fatherhood: A Community-led and Father Driven Approach,"['Wright, Amy', 'Harris, Selby', 'Pace, Jessica E']","['Butt, Michelle Lynn', 'Freeman, Bonnie', 'Johnson, David', 'VanEvery, Rachel']","['Indigenous Fathers', 'Men', 'Parenting', 'Two Spirit']",201588.0,450161,"Early childhood development is critical for a healthy life trajectory, and supporting parents during this time is critical to healthy parenting and promoting the healthy development of children. In particular, the impact of fathers on their infants has been demonstrated to lower infant mortality rates, decrease risks of cognitive delay, improve parent-infant attachment and reduce parental depression. The role of Indigenous fathers in the lives of their infants is less understood. Colonization has disrupted traditional parenting roles leaving few resources to conceptualize fatherhood and its associated responsibilities. Additionally, parent programs are typically Euro-centric and focus on mothers. 
In a scoping study on the role of Indigenous fathers in meeting the health needs of their infants, we found that Indigenous men take a journey to becoming fathers, and that supportive parenting programs developed for and by fathers are severely lacking globally yet an important way to support healthy parenting and early childhood development. 
This 3-phased project takes an Indigenous community-led and gender-focused approach. While the literature suggests that Indigenous fathers are adopting contemporary parenting styles, they long to regain traditional roles and value integrating culture and spiritual wellbeing into their parenting. Phase 1 involves gaining a thorough understanding of fathers' needs during their journey to fatherhood. Phase 2 is a community-led development of a Parenting Program for Fathers. Phase 3 will see the implementation of a pilot Program and its evaluation. This project will fill a current gap in services for Indigenous men and Two Spirit folks by supporting fathers in their parenting and promoting the healthy development of children. In future, the Program can be adapted for use by other Indigenous communities, having a national and global impact on the wellbeing of Indigenous families."

Indigenous Peoples while strong and able, nevertheless experience discrimination and are at risk for experiencing harm by participating in research, despite recent guidelines supporting ethical conduct. In particular, Indigenous Peoples who are gender and sexually diverse may be especially at risk of harm by research due to experiences of homophobia, transphobia, racism, and intergenerational trauma. 
When used together with a culturally safe approach, trauma and violence-informed care (TVIC) can help to address the risk for trauma and harm in research that is caused by systemic violence, structural inequities, and historical and current trauma and violence. Researchers educated in TVIC approaches to research can better recognize and support people impacted by trauma and violence, to ensure their safety while participating in research, and further support their leadership, agency, and wellness.
This community-engaged project aims to: 1) understand the experiences and needs of Indigenous and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people and their participation in research; 2) develop a training resource for researchers to equip them to design and conduct TVIC research; 3) pilot and evaluate the resource for its effectiveness; and 4) disseminate the resource to researchers and trainees across Ontario, promoting safe and positive research interactions with Indigenous people and reducing potential for harm.
Indigenous research methodologies and the Two-Eyed Seeing framework will be used to co-develop studies with the research team and an Indigenous content committee, built of Elders, Knowledge Holders/Keepers and community members. The project will include innovative strategies to engage Indigenous community members and researchers in the project, and encourage uptake and sustainability of the training resource."
Extending the Circle: Sharing Indigenous Men's Voices to Encourage Healthy Living.,"['Wright, Amy', 'Pace, Jessica E']",['N/A'],"['Health Promotional Resources', 'Healthy Living', 'Indigenous Men']",25000.0,499935,"Indigenous people in Canada have experienced higher rates of diabetes because of systemic and social inequities. These factors, among others, undermine Indigenous values, cultures, and self-determination of their own health and wellbeing, with lasting effects on health and wellness. Preventing and managing diabetes includes promoting healthy lifestyles during infant development, and across the lifespan. Parents and caregivers are important for helping children develop healthy behaviours, and there are significant benefits for children whose fathers are involved in shaping these values. Yet, fathers are not often visible in health education resources. 

To address this, Dr. Pace and the Indigenous Diabetes Health Circle (IDHC), along with Dr. Wright, from the University of Toronto, will create a video resource of a traditional talking circle with Indigenous men and Elders sharing stories and teachings related to healthy living. Indigenous men, fathers, and youth will benefit from seeing themselves reflected in the men speaking in the video, who act as role models and sources of inspiration of healthy living to their peers and to youth. Additionally, the use of a talking circle to share this information allows exposure to a culturally important tradition, supporting spiritual wellness and access to culture that some may not otherwise have. 

Using a community-engaged approach guided by the Two Eyed Seeing framework and 4Rs of research, this video resource will be an important addition to IDHC's programming aimed at promoting healthy living amongst Indigenous communities. Guided by an Advisory Board made up of Indigenous men, fathers, and Elders, the team will also develop a comprehensive communication strategy, including the development of a training module, to encourage uptake and use of the video by community healthy workers and community members."

The proposed study will build on a two-year study addressing mental health protective factors for youth in a rural and remote Indigenous community through revitalizing ancestral kinship teachings involving carving a cedar dug-out canoe. Through this research, it became evident that we were working to heal the impacts of colonialism through cultural continuity, a social determinant of Indigenous health (Loppie & Wein, 2009) and creating a pathway to community wellness. Our initial findings indicate the importance of intergenerational knowledge transmission and the participation of whole community so that youth have authentic experiences of meaningful contributions while engaging the natural laws of their nation. Drawing on Dione Stout's (2012) call for a paradigm shift in Indigenous health frameworks and the initial findings from the previous study, our university team will engage six nations over the next three years to develop nation-specific community wellness frameworks that support and restore youth roles in community. This study will engage 4 Indigenous doctoral students in human and social development programs to be mentored in community-led land-based healing and wellness research activities, and 6 community partners responsible for community wellness and cultural heritage in their respective nations, including 3 nations in BC and 3 nations in the NWT/Nunavut.

This has become evident in Canada where, in the summer of 2023, wildfires had devastating impacts in several provinces and triggered a state of emergency in the Northwest Territories (NWT). Research has shown links between climate change and health, especially during the perinatal period that includes the period during and following pregnancy. This period is recognized for its biological vulnerability, need for consistent health services and intergenerational impacts, with exposure to climate hazards increasing the risk for physical and mental complications during pregnancy, postpartum and early childhood development. These poorer health outcomes are disproportionately experienced by Indigenous Peoples, racialized communities, and gender diverse individuals. The critical intersection of climate, structural discrimination, perinatal health and infant feeding is poorly understood, however, in current climate emergency planning, from municipal to national levels. This research study aims to address these gaps by using an intersectional framework to explore the impacts of climate emergencies on perinatal health and infant feeding, using the NWT wildfires as a case study. A community-based participatory approach will guide each research phase from design to knowledge sharing and center the voices and experiences of community members in impacted areas of the NWT through survey, semi-structured interviews and focus groups. The findings will be shared with stakeholders at various levels of authority and influence to work towards a collective understanding of the shortcomings of existing planning with a focus on future inclusive and culturally safe approaches to perinatal and infant feeding health services and supports during forthcoming climate hazards and disasters."

We will undertake this research with a view to meeting two objectives. First, we seek to investigate how the pre and in-crisis trust context has shaped the response to COVID-19 in China and Canada (Objective 1). Second, we seek to understand how the COVID-19 outbreak response and experience then shaped the post-crisis context of trust in in China and Canada (Objective 2). The inclusion of both countries is vital not only for the possible control that Canada provides to the Chinese case, but also because it will allow for a more global picture of the impacts that the crisis had on individuals who are ethnically Chinese living outside of China. We will make these contributions by analyzing existing trust data collected prior to the outbreak (pre-crisis); by adding questions about the outbreak to current surveys being conducted on trust in China by team members (in-crisis rapid response conducted immediately); by conducting a new rapidly developed online survey to be administered in China and Canada (in-crisis rapid response conducted immediately; repeated post crisis), and by conducting focus groups with citizens in Chinese and Canadian cities (in crisis Canada only rapid response; repeated post crisis both countries). We anticipate that our team, which brings together experts in trust and health from the center of the outbreak in China, including in Wuhan city, as well as leading scholars on trust and public health in Canada and Sweden, is ideally positioned to conduct this research.  As a result of team members' ongoing and previous collaborations we are well-poised for the rapid engagement that is urgently needed in order to meet the global challenge posed by the COVID-19 outbreak."
Application of the ORBIT model to test a tailored smoking cessation intervention for persons with spinal cord injury,"['Wuerstl, Kelsey R']",['N/A'],"['Behaviour Change Theory', 'Behavioural Trials', 'Integrated Knowledge Translation', 'Orbit Model', 'Smoking Cessation', 'Spinal Cord Injury']",105000.0,440006,"A spinal cord injury (SCI) occurs from damage to the spinal cord and is associated with adverse health and social implications. Traditionally, health promotion has focused on the prevention of disease and disability, resulting in limited health promotion interventions for persons with SCI. An example of health promotion that has been overlooked for persons with SCI is smoking cessation. Compared to the general population, persons with SCI are more likely to smoke, experience more significant tobacco-related health disparities, and encounter unique circumstances to treatment. Despite these inequities, smoking cessation interventions have yet to be developed to support persons with SCI to stop smoking. Interventions developed using theory, systematic processes, and engagement of knowledge users are often more useful and relevant to those who may benefit from it. The ORBIT model was developed to improve the real-world impact of behavioural interventions by ensuring that interventions are carefully crafted and developed incrementally over time. 
The objective of this research is to use behaviour change theory and meaningful partnership with an SCI organization to develop and conduct preliminary testing of a smoking cessation intervention for persons with SCI. First, in a small sample of persons with SCI, we will test whether a tailored smoking cessation intervention helps persons with SCI stop smoking. Second, using gold-standard video recording methodology, we will determine whether peers with SCI can be trained to deliver the intervention as intended. Third, using a randomized design, we will determine whether the peer-delivered smoking cessation intervention can demonstrate greater smoking cessation rates compared to a care-as-usual control group. The findings from this study will be used to inform a future efficacy trial and may result in high-quality smoking cessation supports for persons with SCI."

Focusing on out-of-province/state and international college students (17-24 years of age) in Halifax, Canada, and Boston, the U.S., this exploratory project will use a mixed-method survey to generate preliminary data for understanding students' DMHP awareness and identifying their DMHP specific challenges and unique needs. These college student-driven data will be discussed with diverse on-campus stakeholders in two workshops hosted in Halifax and Boston, respectively. The workshop discussion will generate recommendations to advocate for youth-centric DMHP in organizational disaster and emergency management. The recommendations will inform service providers and decision-makers to develop related on-/off-campus resources, services, and plans to support students' mental health pre-, peri-, and post-disaster. Moving forward, the team will pursue other external grants to develop a full cross-national partnership by inviting research, practice, and decision-making collaborators to promote DMHP and empower youth leadership in achieving climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction."

However, despite this good prognosis, adolescents face a host of negative side effects, heightening their risk for disability, illness, and reduced quality of life. Beyond these negative effects, cancer- and treatment-related consequences may uniquely hinder adolescents' physical, psychological and social development further impairing quality of life. Physical activity is recognized as a safe, effective and beneficial strategy for improving quality of life in child and adult cancer populations, yet its effectiveness in adolescents remains largely unexplored. It is therefore critical to confirm the role physical activity may play in this population in an effort to reduce the burden of cancer and its treatments. Thus, the purpose of this research project is to explore the role of physical activity in adolescent oncology (13-19 years) and determine the optimal timing of delivering a physical activity intervention (during or following treatment). To do this, 3 studies will be conducted to: (1) summarize existing research on physical activity in adolescent oncology; (2) explore the associations between physical activity and various health outcomes and determine if treatment status (on or off-treatment) affects these associations; (3) test the feasibility, acceptability and optimal timing (during or after treatment) of delivering a physical activity intervention. This program of research will explore the role of physical activity to improve those aspects of quality of life thwarted by cancer during adolescence. Moreover, it will provide the foundation for the design and development of larger studies. Finally, it will provide crucial insight into promoting physical activity and enhancing quality of life in this growing population."

However, most will experience negative effects that can greatly reduce their health and quality of life. In-hospital physical activity (PA) during treatment is one strategy that can reduce negative physical and psychosocial effects and enhance quality of life in the short- and long-term. Though in-hospital PA practices (ie, recommendations, education, opportunities) are advocated for children during treatment, hospitals in Canada do not provide PA practices as part of usual care. Consequently, most children with cancer are not active enough to receive the health benefits PA can offer. Further, PA remains low for years or decades following treatment. In select countries internationally, in-hospital PA practices are part of usual care. Research suggests improved care and enhanced health and quality of life in the short- and long-term at these centres. To address the gap in childhood cancer care in Canada, this research program will develop, implement, and evaluate in-hospital PA practices for children undergoing treatment for cancer. To do this, healthcare professionals (eg, oncologists, nurses, physiotherapists, child life specialists), childhood cancer patients and their caregivers, and experts (ie, researchers and healthcare professionals who have successfully implemented in-hospital PA practices in their centres) will be consulted. These individuals will help identify strategies for implementing in-hospital PA practices into usual cancer care. Once identified, these practices will be implemented and evaluated in the Alberta Children's Hospital and Stollery Children's Hospital. If successful, the outputs from this project have the potential to improve existing care and enhance health and quality of life in the short- and long-term for children undergoing treatment for cancer in Canada."

Despite having all the tools necessary to stop the spread of disease, those populations most vulnerable to HIV continue to suffer from a lack of access to testing and treatment.  The issue largely comes down to marginalization; those individuals most at risk of HIV, tend to be those who are most marginalized in society and have the poorest access to and ability to find health care resources and services.  Therefore, HIV prevention does not necessarily need new or better diagnostic or treatment options, rather, the degree of marginalization of those populations most vulnerable to disease must be reduced, such that they are aware of and can take advantage of the services available.  In this proposal we use the latest technological innovations in eHealth approaches to health promotion to better bridge the gap between marginalized populations and health care providers.

In Uganda, HIV and Tuberculosis are overarching public health issues. In-depth knowledge of how the local people understand the interaction between TB and HIV is currently not available for health care providers in most parts of Uganda.
The proposed study will investigate knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of the relationship between HIV and TB in western Uganda. The main objectives of the proposed research are: (1) To assess knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions about TB/HIV co-infection amongst TB, HIV, and co-infected patients as well as the larger community in western Uganda; (2) To identify specific misconceptions and beliefs that may influence utilization of TB and HIV services and adherence to treatment; (3) To examine current levels of TB stigma and the extent to which HIV stigma may have contributed to a possibly increased stigma towards TB; (4) To assess knowledge and clinical practice of health care workers in TB and HIV control programs with regards to TB/HIV co-infection.
This study will use a complementary mixed methods approach with both quantitative and qualitative assessments. The quantitative methods will include the administration of a questionnaire to patients being treated for HIV, TB, or both and to members of the general population of the district. The qualitative methods will include focus group discussions and in depth interviews with a subset of participants from each study group. Interviews with key informants from the health services will also be conducted. The proposed study will help to understand patient's, caregiver's and the community's understanding and perceptions of TB/HIV co-infection in order to tailor services to the specific needs of the patients."
The Relationship Between Overt Visual Attention and Constructive Episodic Simulation in Older Adults,"['Wynn, Jordana']",['N/A'],"['Cognitive Aging', 'Memory', 'Visual Attention']",140000.0,436241,"One of the most frequently reported and debilitating signs of cognitive aging is difficulty recalling details from one's past (episodic memory). Consequentially, older adults not only have trouble reconstructing past events, but also simulating future events (episodic simulation) by drawing on information from past experiences. Despite the significant health, social, and economic outcomes of cognitive aging, relatively little is known about the cognitive and neural processes underlying age-related changes in episodic memory and simulation, and particularly, how they interact with other cognitive processes. Recent work indicates that aging is accompanied by significant declines in visual attention and perception. In short, older adults see the world differently than younger adults. Given that where we look determines what we can encode into memory and subsequently remember, understanding how older adults orient visual attention is critical for understanding age-related changes in memory. Accordingly, the proposed research program will use converging eye movement monitoring and neuroimaging techniques to investigate the relationship between episodic memory and simulation and overt visual attention, indexed via eye movements, in older adults. Specifically, the proposed studies will aim to: (i) characterize the role of overt attentional shifts in episodic memory and simulation in older adults, (ii) investigate age-related changes in the brain areas supporting these processes, and (iii) identify potential strategies for improving episodic memory and simulation by manipulating overt visual attention (i.e., where older adults look). Together, the proposed studies will significantly improve our understanding of age-related memory declines by probing the cognitive and neural links between mnemonic and attentional processes, and will advance new methods for investigating, and potentially mitigating such declines by directly manipulating visual attention."
"Real-time epidemiological intelligence to inform control of SARS-CoV-2: improving the precision, validity, and granularity of estimates of the effective reproduction number in Canada","['Xia, Yiqing']",['N/A'],"['Covid-19', 'Effective Reproduction Number', 'Epidemiology', 'Mathematical Modelling', 'Sras-Cov-2']",105000.0,458825,"Infectious disease epidemics pose significant threats to the health of Canadians and the economy. Efficient control of outbreaks relies on timely epidemic intelligence, such as the effective reproduction number (Rt). The latter represents the expected number of secondary cases arising from a primary case infected at a given time. In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, Rt has been playing a key role in guiding decision-making. To track and ""now-cast"" the epidemic in near real-time, models estimating Rt have been developed following best practices. However, some limitations are recognized.
First, current models have difficulty accounting for potential temporal changes in the infectivity profile of individuals (i.e., the generation interval). Second, some infections have yet to be observed (i.e., right truncation of events) and reporting delays (i.e., bottlenecks in testing capacity and reporting) make real-time estimation complicated. Finally, it is intricate to calculate Rt by age groups or by settings (e.g., schools, hospitals) despite the importance of such metrics for decision-making.
Without lifelong immunity, COVID-19 is likely to become seasonally endemic, even with vaccines and potential boosters. As such, monitoring SARS-CoV-2 transmission will remain a priority in the coming years, and addressing the knowledge gaps is important. For this research, I propose to systematically review existing methods for Rt estimation, develop new tools to incorporate and adjust for the issues highlighted above, and build new models to enable the estimation of Rt by age and setting.
Addressing these critical gaps will lead to a more nuanced understanding of the effectiveness of interventions and the prompt identification of outbreaks. It will allow for prioritizing the most vulnerable groups when implementing public health policies and allocating scarce resources. These methods could also be adapted to other infectious diseases threats such as seasonal influenza, SARS, and others."

A common way of gathering HRQoL is to use a questionnaire to obtain the description of a person's health status and assign a value to it. The difference in the values before and after a treatment would be the impact on HRQoL. It has been a consensus among the research community that the values should come from the general public based on the fact that any decision made within a taxpayer-supported health care system (like Canada) will affect all taxpayers. A HRQoL questionnaire, called the EuroQol, developed by an international research group, has been most widely used in the world in the past decades. The first step of the proposed research is to develop a scoring system that can be used to assign values to the health statuses defined by this questionnaire. We will interview a random sample of the Canadian general population using the EuroQol. The second step is to determine the smallest difference in the values between health statuses that would be meaningful to the general public. We will use the data from the 2011 Commonwealth Fund (CWF) International Health Policy Survey for Sicker Adults in Canada. This will ensure proper interpretation of results from future uses of this questionnaire. The third step will again use the data from the 2011 CWF Survey to describe health status of Canadians with different chronic health conditions. To ensure the voices from the general public being heard when providing health care, the future research direction would be to explore the feasibility of incorporating the EuroQol into routine clinical practice as one of the important indicators of performance of health care and the health care system."

Accessibility and Cost-Utility of Virtual versus In-Person Care for Adults with Knee Osteoarthritis in Ontario,"['Xi, Min']",['N/A'],"['Cost-Effectiveness', 'Cost-Utility', 'Economic Evaluation', 'Health Equity', 'Healthcare Access', 'Knee Osteoarthritis', 'Pain', 'Physical Function', 'Virtual Care']",105000.0,496545,"Supervisor: Dr Andy Kin On Wong, University of Toronto

Knee osteoarthritis affects over 4.4 million Canadians. Knee osteoarthritis causes severe pain and disability (e.g., difficulty climbing stairs and walking). Individuals living with knee osteoarthritis require constant medical care such as rehabilitation, total knee replacement, and pain medication to reduce symptoms. However, individuals living with knee osteoarthritis tend to experience difficulties accessing medical care due to reduced mobility. Virtual care (delivered via phone or videoconferencing) may offer a possible solution. The COVID-19 pandemic prompted the widespread uptake of virtual care. The transition to a post-pandemic setting presents a unique opportunity to optimize the integration of virtual and in-person care in a way that facilitates critical improvements to equitable healthcare delivery and save healthcare dollars. Working closely with hospital management, provincial policymakers, and community organizations, I will use longitudinal surveys and administrative health data to identify barriers and facilitators to virtual care access for adults living with knee osteoarthritis in Ontario and determine scenarios where virtual care for pain management and functional rehabilitation will provide good value for money (i.e., cost-effective) compared to in-person care for adults living with knee osteoarthritis. By pinpointing barriers to virtual care access faced by a vulnerable population, my findings can inform community-level programs that can assist patients with the access to care they need. I will share my findings with hospital management, provincial policymakers, and community organizations to ensure that study findings will help inform budget and resource allocation to virtual care programs to optimize population-level health benefits for people living with knee osteoarthritis and others with similar conditions in Ontario and similar settings."

First, I will investigate the responsiveness and coordination of services in addressing IPV and related needs from the perspectives of leaders in the violence against women sector (for instance, agencies supporting women fleeing violence) as well as women who have recently experienced IPV and accessed supportive housing services. Second, I will evaluate the effectiveness of an app intervention in increasing access to services across sectors and improving health and wellbeing among women who have experienced recent IPV attending fracture clinics in Toronto. Finally, informed by these previous phases, I will explore the perspectives of LGBTQ people who recently experienced IPV and accessed supportive housing on service barriers and gaps, the acceptability of the app intervention, and where changes are needed. This project will indicate directions for more effective collaborative action across sectors and interventions to improve the health and wellbeing of high-risk populations experiencing IPV in Canada."

VAW organizations across the country quickly adapted to meet these conditions. However, what is unclear is how VAW interventions were implemented, what factors internal and external to VAW organizations impacted these processes, and the outcomes for VAW survivors. This is a barrier to identifying which VAW response strategies worked best and the contextual factors that facilitated success, critical to ameliorating the impacts of COVID-19 on VAW and preparing for future emergencies.

This research aims to address these gaps by building upon our previous rapid research on the processes and experiences of adapting VAW services in Toronto. As a diverse team of academics, VAW organizations, and women with lived experience of violence, we will mobilize our existing networks and extend this research across the provinces of Ontario, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. Our research will include a survey of VAW staff and in-depth interviews with staff and survivors who have accessed VAW services during the pandemic to develop an up-to-date understanding of how VAW services were adapted during the pandemic, the contextual factors (like funding, staff wellbeing, and collaboration with other sectors) that impacted these adaptations, and how well services have been meeting the needs of VAW survivors, including how these needs have been impacted by COVID-19. In line with our earlier study in Toronto, we will investigate the experiences of VAW survivors facing different forms of marginalization (e.g., racialized women or women experiencing economic instability, who use drugs, or who identify as sexual or gender minorities). This research will further examine how provincial and municipal policies and practices have served as barriers or facilitators and the experiences of VAW survivors in rural and remote areas."

Relatively less is also known about arthritis in the populations from which these immigrants originate, particularly those from low and middle-income countries. Given that the burden of arthritis in these regions is expected to grow, this represents an important gap in our knowledge. We propose to explore these issues from the unique perspectives of Indian and Chinese immigrants in Canada and England, the two largest immigrant populations in these countries, as well as local populations in India and China. Our primary objective is to establish and maintain an international network of key investigators, stakeholders and informants with the aim of developing a program of research and activities that address gaps in our knowledge concerning arthritis in Chinese and Indian immigrant populations in Canada and England and local populations in China and India.

The primary outcome of this planning project will be the development of a multidisciplinary, global network that aims to investigate arthritis health across and between these populations and countries. Our focus will be arthritis health, health equity and HRQL in a global setting. Planned activities include a symposium, a systematic review to catalyze discussions at the symposium, a public forum with immigrants in Edmonton and a symposium report. Collectively, the output of these planned activities will be used to inform the development of a research grant and help plan future activities. The novel aspects of this work include comparisons within and between understudied ethnic groups in different settings and the assessment of the role of larger global factors (economic, social, environmental) in contributing to the burden of arthritis in these populations."

Investigating factors that can affect urban mitigation and adaptation measures is key for lowering risks and building resilience across affected populations. Specifically, this study considers the use of indices for informing equitable climate change and health policies and programs. In addition, it increases the involvement and options available to higher-risk groups like older adults and immigrant communities.

In 2018, WCRF summarized current knowledge and found that physical activity can prevent colon, postmenopausal breast, and endometrial cancer, but less clear for others. It is difficult to get information on physical activity, and many studies are not large enough for many cancers. Therefore, the real potential of physical activity to prevent cancer is unclear.
Physical activity is often measured by a survey asking people the type (i.e. walking), duration (i.e. 30 minutes) and frequency (i.e. once a week) of the activities they do in a certain time frame (i.e., past 7 days, past 4 weeks). This is not accurate because activities are limited to those listed, and people often think they are more active than they are. Another method is to use an accelerometer, a small wearable device. Accelerometer has been proven to be more accurate, but the device is expensive and time-consuming.
The ideal scenario would be asking many people to wear an accelerometer and track them for cancers, yet currently unrealistic. Quantitative bias analyses is an epidemiological method to create an attenuation factor to stimulate this scenario using existing survey data. In other word, with minimal cost, this method could give us more accurate information on what cancer and how much cancer can be prevented through physical activity in studies that have survey data. Dr. Lynch and her group generated the attenuation factor for International Physical Activity Questionnaires against accelerometer and applied it in an Australian cohort. They found physical activity can prevent more colorectal cancer than we thought. To gain more knowledge on other types of cancer, especially fatal cancers, we will now apply the same method in a large UK study that tracked 502,611 people (age 39-83 years) for cancer types that have had more than 200 people diagnosed since the study began."

Cross-cultural research has shown that East Asians pay differentially more attention to contextual and relational information, whereas North Americans and Europeans are inclined to process context-independent features and categorical information (Park & Gutchess, 2006). This raises a possibility that East Asians may be superior at binding contextual or relational information whereas Westerners may be better at binding categorical information together. If applying a culture-specific binding strategy is resource-demanding, the culture differences may diminish with aging because the strategy use will be increasingly limited by the universal neurobiological decline in older adults (Park, Nisbett, & Hedden, 1999). However, these hypotheses have not been tested to date. The proposed project will investigate the cultural effects on memory binding and its age-related changes through a comparison of younger versus older adults from Chinese Eastern and Canadian Western cultures. The general objective is two-fold: 1) to test the hypothesis that the behavioural and neural measures of memory binding and its age-related changes are sensitive to cultural differences (Phase I); and 2) building on the insights from Phase I, to develop a memory training program for older adults that capitalizes on the binding strategies preferred in both cultures (Phase II). The proposed research will shed light on the relative contributions of biological and cultural influences to cognitive aging, an issue of growing scientific and societal significance. The research will also make important headway in the development of culturally appropriate intervention programs to minimize age-related cognitive decline."
"Cesarean delivery on maternal request in Ontario, Canada.","['Yang, Qiuying']","['Ramsay, Timothy O', 'Walker, Mark C', 'Wen, Shi Wu']","['Birth Outcomes', 'Cesarean Delivery Maternal Request', 'Incidence', 'Risk Factors']",24500.0,173161,"Cesarean delivery on maternal request is defined as a primary cesarean delivery at maternal request in the absence of any medical or obstetric indication by The National Institutes of Health and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. A potential benefit of cesarean delivery on maternal request is decreased risk of hemorrhage for the mother. Potential risks of cesarean delivery on maternal request include a longer maternal hospital stay, an increased risk of respiratory problems for the baby, and greater complications in subsequent pregnancies, including uterine rupture and placental implantation problems. However, the magnitude of cesarean delivery on maternal request is difficult to quantify. There is insufficient evidence to evaluate fully the benefits and risks of cesarean delivery on maternal request compared with planned vaginal delivery, and more research is needed. The proposed study will use the Niday database which is part of the Ontario Perinatal Surveillance System and includes more than 95% of births in Ontario. The Database includes information on the number of women giving birth and babies born in the province, maternal and prenatal factors, health services factors, intrapartum interventions, birth outcomes and infant health. We will identify characteristic factors related to cesarean delivery on request and compare the outcomes between cesarean delivery on maternal request and planned vaginal delivery. Clinicians would benefit from strong evidence regarding risks and benefits, evidence that is crucial to guiding policy making with regard to cesarean delivery on maternal request. If this study finds that no major differences between primary cesarean delivery on maternal request and planned vaginal delivery, a decreasing cesarean section rate will relieve an economic burden on highly stressed medical systems and increase patient satisfaction."

Neurological disorders with early onset in life such as cerebral palsy, autism, and epilepsy have multiple lifelong comorbidities in developmental outcomes including sensory-motor and cognitive impairments and poor behaviour control. Although damage to the developing brain is identified as a cause, the cause of the brain damage is poorly understood. The functional architecture of the brain is formed during gestation, prenatal exposures to maternal illnesses would have adverse effects on the brain development. Two of the most common maternal illnesses during pregnancy are diabetes and severe maternal morbidity (SMM) defined by the presence of multiple life-threatening and disabling diseases and conditions (e.g., eclampsia, thromboembolism, and hemorrhagic disorders). Nevertheless, evidence on the effects of maternal morbidity during pregnancy on offspring neuro-developmental outcomes are scarce
and inconclusive. In this study, we propose to systematically examine burdens of major childhood neuro-developmental disorders and effects of maternal diabetes and severe maternal morbidity on neuro-developmental disorders in Canadian children born between 
2002-2020 in Ontario. Our research will provide evidence that is needed to assess the current and future burdens of neuro-developmental health in children, to understand their causal mechanisms, and to plan further research on management and  preventive interventions."

Moreover, socioeconomic disparities in preterm birth and stillbirth persist in many countries, including Canada. The magnitude and patterns of such socioeconomic disparities also differ across ethnic and cultural sub-groups. These differences have important implications for the health of Canadians, because more than one in five Canadians are immigrants, making Canada highly multi-ethnic. Pregnancy and birth outcomes are not only good measures of current population health but can also predict future health of the population, because health in early life predicts health later in life. Therefore, achieving socioeconomic equity in pregnancy outcomes is an important public health goal. However, existing scientific evidence on socioeconomic and ethno-cultural disparities in pregnancy and birth outcomes in Canada is limited, owing to the lack of detailed socioeconomic and ethno-cultural background information in routinely collected birth and death data. Built upon our previous CIHR-funded research creating national databases linking information on  pregnancy and birth outcomes (Canadian stillbirth, live birth, and infant death databases) with detailed characteristics of parents measured in the long-form censuses of 1996 and 2006, we will perform another such data linkage using the 2016 long-form census. This will allow us to systematically examine the most recent patterns of perinatal health across social, racial/ethnic, and cultural groups, and importantly, disparity patterns over the past 20 years in Canada as a whole and across provinces.

Factors affecting such avoidable hospitalizations include low socioeconomic position, racial/ethnic minority, and lack of continued care, which are all more common in immigrants. Although avoidable hospitalizations are routinely monitored in Canada, it is not assessed among social sub-groups and children. Canada is one of the world's most immigrant destinations, with >20% of the nation's population being foreign-born. Immigrants generally have not only poorer socioeconomic position but also more difficulties in accessing health care than Canadian-born individuals. However, immigrants are not homogeneous. Canada admits international migrants into three categories: economic class, family class, and refugees. Their reasons of migration (e.g., voluntary economic migrants vs. refugees), lived experiences prior to or during migration, health care needs, and selection criteria differ from each other. In this research, we aim to systematically examine patterns of avoidable hospitalizations in women and their Canadian-born children by maternal immigration status and characteristics using a nationally representative cohort of over 9 million infants born in Canada between 1993 and 2017 and their mothers.  By uncovering heterogeneities in rates and causes of avoidable hospitalizations among immigrants and their Canadian offspring, our study will identify (1) who are particularly vulnerable in accessing health care and where the health burdens lie regarding causes of hospitalizations specific to immigrant sub-groups, and (2) the extent to which governmental selection and support programs for immigrants have impacted health of immigrant women and their children in Canada."

CHRISP supports the implementation of a structure and process that will connect researchers with community partners and service providers, leading to a large-scale research study in our region. 
   Preliminary consultation with over 30 community organizations lead ECHO researchers to determine that the concept of resilience could encompass most, if not all, of the organizations' identified research priorities. Accordingly, CHRISP's focus is on improving resilience in children, their families, and their communities. Resilience includes physical and mental health, and the impacts of ecosystem change on children's health. Key vulnerable groups that have been identified include Francophone and Aboriginal children, children with mental health issues, and children with disabilities. 
   CHRISP is a creative monthly meeting process comprised of 6 half-day working sessions alternating with 6 shorter lunch-in-action sessions. During the working sessions invited world-class researchers will help to stimulate and shape research proposals. The lunch-in-action sessions will be held at various community partners to maintain momentum in the development of research projects. There are tremendous opportunities to enhance children's health in northeastern Ontario through research, especially within a municipality the size of Sudbury where organizations are in close proximity. By bringing ECHO researchers and community partners together, we are poised to make a difference in children's health research within our region."

This experienced interdisciplinary intercultural team aims to address this gap, combining arts and humanities with social and health sciences, to examine Ecuador social circus program-the world's largest publicly run social circus program. The team will conduct a systematic literature review, focus groups, interviews and surveys, as well as analyze existing data and observe programs in action. Working closely with the communities involved, the team will contribute to world knowledge on theory, ethics and methods regarding social circus for addressing health disparities, then disseminate this knowledge in Canada and abroad so that others could implement and study social circus programs with the aim of better promoting health equity."

While most infectious diseases can be prevented by improving access to clean water, sanitation, nutrition and immunization, antimicrobials remain essential. The spread of antimicrobial resistance is now a major public health threat driven by many interconnected factors, in particular misuse of antimicrobials for human and veterinary use, cultural conceptions, diagnostic uncertainty, economic incentives, inadequate training of health staff, and advertising from the pharmaceutical industry. Little research has targeted LMICs,and little is known on the effectiveness of community-based interventions. We thus aim to ascertain whether and how applying an ecosystem approach, considered a milestone in Canadian public health research, with its principles of transdisciplinarity, equity, participation and sustainability, can improve antimicrobial use and reduce the prevalence of infectious disease. 

This proposal to improve knowledge, attitudes and practices both by practitioners and the community, brings together four initiatives: the ""Do Bugs Need Drugs?"" Canadian campaign; Ecuadorean partners in Latin America's ReAct (worldwide network to reduce antimicrobial resistance); a Canadian-Ecuadorean research program on food security; and a six-year CIDA-funded project (ending this year) entitled ""Sustainably Managing Environmental Health Risks in Ecuador"", which embraces an ecosystem approach. 

This project builds on a solid partnership with indigenous communities, and will contribute important information on effectiveness of community-based campaigns to promote antibiotic stewardship and reduce infectious disease transmission in LMICs, using a rigorous study design. The study will also add to world knowledge on how to design, implement and evaluate a community-based population health intervention using an ecosystem health approach."

Syndromic surveillance is a way to track the incidence of infectious diseases by monitoring signs and symptoms and the population's use of healthcare services. This information can provide an earlier indication of unexpected increases, thus allowing more efficient and effective emergency public health responses. In 2006, a syndromic surveillance system was developed in Alberta, the Alberta Real Time Syndromic Surveillance Net (ARTSSN), to track information from emergency department (ED) visits, HealthLink calls to trained nurses, and school absence reports to provide advanced warnings about unexpected increases to Alberta Health Services (AHS). Through an engaged project with AHS, we want to use ARTSSN data to provide an even earlier indication of increases in healthcare use related to influenza-like illness (ILI) by predicting these increases before they occur rather than waiting until they have already happened. To do this, we will develop prediction models based on historic patterns of ILI-related healthcare use and, based on this information, predict when ILI-related healthcare use is expected to increase. We will then use our models to provide an early warning to AHS that healthcare use is expected to increase, providing the critical time needed for them to respond effectively. AHS can prepare for these high volumes of healthcare use by, for example, increasing staffing levels at hospitals; distributing necessary supplies; providing the public with up-to-date information; and opening an influenza assessment centre to divert excess volume at EDs. Advanced knowledge about an infectious disease epidemic should enable earlier and more effective preparation, which will help to minimize the spread of disease and improve the outcomes for those infected."

The package contains culturally-tailored and linguistically-appropriate education materials (video, pamphlet, motivational brochure, and local clinic information) and this will be combined with navigation assistance provided by a local Chinese community service center, ASSIST. We will evaluate the public health impact of the dissemination using an evaluation framework called RE-AIM that considers practicality and feasibility in assessing impacts.

Our team has extensive relevant experiences and expertise to conduct this research. With strengths rendered by Internet, the 3-team collaboration (our research team, ASSIST community organization, and Alberta Health Services provincial healthcare agency) aims to reach a large number of local Chinese immigrants and increase their uptake of cervical cancer screening.

Over 50% of people with OUD also have a mental health disorder (MHD) and this combination puts them at high risk of overdose or other causes of death. Unfortunately, few receive treatment for both conditions. Opioid agonist therapy (OAT) is a safe and effective treatment for OUD, reducing cravings and overdose deaths. It may also improve MHD symptoms, but research on OAT's impact on MHD management is limited. This is especially important for people living with HIV (PLWH). Despite progress in HIV care, having both OUD and MHD are lowering the chances of living longer in PLWH. This study wants to understand whether periods of engagement and disengagement in OAT affect MHD management in PLWH. We will look at two aspects of MHD management: giving out MHD medications (dispensation) and ensuring individuals take them regularly as prescribed (adherence). We will examine mood and anxiety disorders and psychotic disorders, along with the medicines used to manage these conditions (antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anxiolytics). We think that people on OAT may need fewer MHD medications as OAT can improve some MHD symptoms, and their adherence may be better during OAT engagement. We will analyze anonymized healthcare records of PLWH with OUD and MHD in British Columbia (BC) between 2012 and 2020, during BC's overdose and mental health crises escalation. Our analysis plan includes using a mix of traditional statistical methods and artificial intelligence techniques. This research could inform personalized MHD management and appropriate prescribing practices during OAT by identifying specific MHD medicines people adhere to.

Altogether, diabetes related end-stage kidney disease and death are almost nine times as frequent compared to the rest of the population3. The reasons for these inequities are multifaceted, grounded in historic and ongoing harmful impacts of colonization on traditional ways of living. Existing evidence suggests that any solution to this problem will be similarly complex, requiring a person and community-centred approach that is strongly informed by Indigenous ways of knowing, and cultural safety. These approaches must reflect traditions in Indigenous health and wellness with a better-informed understanding of how Indigenous pathways to resilience can guide and inform improvements in health care, education of health providers and linkages between 'western' health systems and Indigenous paradigms of health and wellness. Through this project, we propose to develop a deeper understanding of gaps and system failures in the provision of diabetes care and prevention through the use of culturally-driven digital storytelling and community engagement to inform co-creation of strategies to support more meaningful and effective support for people living with diabetes and their families, co-creation of interventions to prevent diabetes, and, strengthening communication and collaboration between Weeneeybayko Health Authority health providers and diabetes education and support services, community members (including Indigenous youth and Elders) and Queen's University-based health providers."

The family unit is an integral part in the prevention and treatment of children's problematic weight-related outcomes (e.g., obesity, binge-eating, extreme weight control behaviors, physical activity), and research has suggested that family meals, which can be considered a proxy for overall family functioning, serve a protective function against obesity. However, little is known about the protective function of family meals in the presence of negative peer relationships, such as within the contexts of peer weight-teasing. Hence, this project will investigate variables associated with family functioning, such as family meal frequency, and positive parental socialization of emotions, as protective factors between peer weight-related teasing and problematic weight-related outcomes."

Extreme cold is also a serious problem, killing more than 80 people each year in Canada, and causing frostbite and other injuries for countless more. People who are unhoused or living in subsidized housing (e.g., single room occupancy units), including seniors, are known to be more vulnerable to extreme temperature-related dangers - demonstrating that both housing security and quality matter. Although there are warming and cooling centres, they are under-used in metro Vancouver. To understand how to better meet the needs of people who may use these extreme temperature shelters, we will interview those most at risk - people who are unhoused, or live in subsidized housing, including seniors - about their experiences with extreme heat and cold, whether they make use of warming/cooling centres, as well as how to improve or transform these services. We will also talk to shelter providers to understand what their needs are to improve services. 
The findings will help address the growing need to better match user needs and provider capacities around extreme temperatures. This is an urgent issue as the impacts of extreme temperatures on priority populations are becoming a bigger and more frequent threat because of climate change. 
This project will be carried out together with community partner organizations, which will help amplify existing community knowledge and allow for more effective implementation of community-driven solutions. We are also bringing together different health-related government organizations, which will help push research findings into action. Furthermore, through a research report-back workshop, we provide an opportunity for community members to directly communicate to decision makers about project findings based on their lived experiences."

Unstable housing and concurrent mental health concerns have been linked to increased risk of substance misuse and related mortality. Despite the concentration of addiction, mental health, and housing services in big cities, the Covid-19 pandemic has revealed deep inequities in access to help for women and gender diverse LGBTQ2S+ people with substance use challenges. There is a particular need to address the gender-specific needs of women with substance use challenges who belong to racialized and/orLGBTQ2S+ communities through the co-design of urban solutions that will lead to healthy cities for all. This project seeks to maximize the health-promoting potential of urban addiction services by engaging stakeholders and communities to identify research and service-related priorities that follow the lead of people with living and lived experiences (PWLE) of substance use and their families and friends. This work requires time and trust to build truly collaborative partnerships across multiple sectors that engage communities in ways that are not tokenistic but that deepen community connections and help build resilient and thriving urban communities. This planning initiative will create a cross-sector strategic advisory table consisting of (PWLE), family and friends, community groups, municipal, social, and health service providers, and lay community members to examine the needs and barriers to supporting spaces and places for community healing and connection for women and racialized and/or LGBTQ2+ women who use substances in order to identify research, service, and policy priorities and future collaborations."

Sometimes, swimming or playing in the water and sand can make people sick from disease-causing microbes. These microbes can cause diarrhea, vomiting, upset stomach, flu-like illness, skin rash, earaches, or eye infections. Many people with these illnesses have to stay home sick from work or school. This costs society a lot of money. In serious cases, people may need to go to the hospital. Children get sick more often than adults. Their illnesses also tend to be more serious. Right now, we do not have enough information about how often people get sick from swimming and playing at beaches in Canada. People who go to the beach also might not know about how to protect themselves from these illnesses.

This study will look at how often Canadians get sick from swimming and playing at public beaches. The results will help us make better guidelines for safe swimming in Canada. They will also help people understand how to keep themselves safe at the beach. In this study, we will survey people who go to the beach and see if they get sick afterwards. We will look at whether there is a link between swimming and the risk of getting sick. We will also look at risks of getting sick from other water activities and playing in the sand. We will also see if certain groups of people, like children, are more likely to get sick than others. We will test the beach water for microbes that can make people sick, and we will find out where they came from. This will help us figure out the sources of pollution that make people sick at the beach. We will also speak with people to find out what they think about water quality and what they do to stay safe at the beach.

The study will take place at eight popular beaches in British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario. A group of researchers and experts will guide the study. Our goal is to make swimming and playing at the beach safer for everyone in Canada."

However, these activities can lead to increased risks of acquiring acute gastrointestinal illness and respiratory, skin, ear, and eye infections among beachgoers. These illnesses have a significant health and economic burden on society, with young children having much higher rates of illness than other age groups. Currently, baseline data are lacking on the risk of recreational water illness in Canada, and beachgoers may lack awareness and understanding of these risks and how to prevent them. 

This study will identify the burden of recreational water illness among Canadian beachgoers. The results will be used to develop recommendations for improving recreational water quality guidelines for safe swimming in Canada, as well as public health risk management and communication strategies with beachgoers. The study will use a mixed-methods approach, consisting of a prospective cohort study and a qualitative study of beachgoers. We will determine the risk of acquiring recreational water illness outcomes in beachgoers that engage in different levels of water and sand contact. We will examine differences in illness risks by beachgoer gender, age, and location. We will examine relationships between fecal indicator bacteria (E. coli), environmental conditions, and host-specific biomarkers with the risk of gastrointestinal illness among beachgoers. We will also evaluate beachgoer risk perceptions and behaviours toward recreational water quality. 

The study will take place at five targeted beach sites in British Columbia, Manitoba, and Ontario. The study will be coordinated by a multidisciplinary research team, with activities guided by a stakeholder steering group consisting of key knowledge users.

This project will lay the foundation for a larger project that will identify, extract and combine data at the residential level on family-friendly community resources (FFCR) across Canadian regions.  Data will be matched to individual-level data from an already existing longitudinal data set: The Canadian Work Stress and Health Study (CAN-WSH), which includes a myriad of health measures and work-family interface questions. The process of data extraction and matching will allow us to develop definitions and protocols surrounding what constitutes effective FFCR for future reference. ""Effective"" FFCR would be defined as those resources that are helpful in reducing parents' WFC and buffering its deleterious health effects. 

The Planning Grant will cover operation costs that will allow us to achieve the following preliminary work in the first year of the project: We will identify regions for FFCR data extraction based on respondents' residents in the CAN-WSH data; teams will then begin to extract clean and code information on FFCR. We will employ tests to ensure inter-rater reliability across research teams. We will then begin to connect these data to individual-level data from the CAN-WSH.

A related concept, evidence-informed healthcare (EIH), has more recently become the standard process within our public health system.  However, this evolution in the delivery of care has not been implemented in most First-Nations communities.  We believe that there is a tremendous opportunity to change the health and lives of children living in First Nations in Ontario through the implementation of EIH.

The Aboriginal Children's Health and Well-being Measure (ACHWM) is the first health and well-being measure specifically designed for First Nations children and youth.  It has been tested in one community and we are ready to share this with other communities.  We are seeking funding to travel to 3 First Nations to share the measure, and to prepare plans for adapting and implementing the measure, via 2-day workshops in each community. 

We are a collaborative team with a history of culturally sound research.  Our members include a First Nations Health Director, a Canada Research Chair in Rural and Northern Children's Health, and a new researcher who focuses on Aboriginal children's resilience. We shared our work on the ACHWM with the health directors affiliated with the Union of Ontario Indians (Anishinabek Nation) on October 10th 2012, and are seeking financial support to enable the face-to-face discussions that must follow.  These discussions are critical to the development of respectful relationships with First Nations and are essential for planning the next steps via new community-university partnership projects."

Suicide rates among youth, a marker of the devastating impact of intergenerational trauma, are higher in rural and remote communities where access to treatment is limited, and children are reluctant to seek help. There is currently an urgent need to address these inequities, a culturally-relevant screening tool to identify children-at-risk, and promising programs to support their healing (e.g., Journey to Wellness).

This proposal focuses on the scale-up and national spread of the Aboriginal Children's Health and Well-being Measure (ACHWM); a tablet-based wellness measure, co-created with Indigenous children. It is remarkably efficient in screening for mental health challenges, connects children-at-risk to local supports, and provides locally relevant data to inform program planning and policy.

Two factors are restricting the reach of the ACHWM: the structure of the existing sharing strategy has reached maximum capacity with 50 partners and is unable to meet the growing demand; and the children most in need of assessment and support are often not able to obtain parental consent. We propose to: (1) leverage  technology to recreate our digital processes to redesign scale-up, spread nationally and create sustainability; and (2) study alternative consent options to respect the rights of parents and the needs of children, to develop culturally appropriate wise practices that extend the tool's reach and promote equitable access. 

Our team is strong, with years of respectful collaborative research with Indigenous communities across Canada. Our program will impact children by identifying needs and connecting them to healing services. It will reduce barriers to participation in community-based screening to enhance equitable access, and deliver a sustainable strategy to share the ACHWM. Together we will explore integration within local health systems, and develop community-to-community sharing of the approach."

The main goal of this project is to create program resources geared to Indigenous children in rural and remote regions of Canada.  This population is uniquely vulnerable, will be heavily impacted by Covid-19 restrictions, and lacks access to health supports that most Canadians take for granted. 
This project has two phases.  
In Phase I, we will review all available information on emotional wellness programs. We will: (a) assess each program's relevance to Indigenous children, (b) determine the program's feasibility in the context of rural and remote communities, and (c) document the level of evidence of the program's effectiveness.  
We are aware that improving the spectrum of services available will be pointless if stigma continues to prevent children from accessing support. Thus, in Phase II, we will create a positive messaging strategy that normalizes and prioritizes emotional health.  
This project will create new information for leaders, that is grounded in both evidence and culture, tailored for their use and easy to access, including:
•tips sheets that summarize information about each program, 
•a repository of reference materials, and
•positive messaging materials to reduce stigma.
Our results will inform enhancements to stepped care, support children's emotional wellness, and prevent crises. We will share the results broadly through the www.ACHWM.ca partner portal to aid communities as they work to promote wellness and recovery for school-aged Indigenous children during and following Covid-19."

In particular, women living at or below the low-income cut-off are less likely to initiate prenatal care in their first trimester and to attend regular prenatal classes. This is of concern because prenatal classes have been shown to be beneficial, resulting in more positive outcomes for mothers and babies (ex. higher birth weights for children of mothers who attended prenatal classes, and fewer emergency Caesarean sections performed on women who attended prenatal classes). Apart from conventional maternity care options (i.e. physicians, obstetricians, hospital deliveries), there is also an increasing number of alternative options available such as home birthing, doulas (non-medical birthing assistants), midwifery, and complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) such as yoga, massage, and acupuncture. While these practices can be beneficial to pregnant women, they are not accessible to all, as most are not covered by public health insurance. Little is known about low-income women's knowledge and use of CAMs, and about the factors which influence women's decision-making around these options when it comes to pregnancy and birth. Utilization factors and barriers are complex phenomena and should be studies as such. Therefore, this project will use in-depth interviews to explore low-income women's use and knowledge of conventional and alternative maternity care. This research will add to our understanding of women's views of their care needs and preferences, the barriers and facilitators that exist to accessing maternity care, and the social contexts within which women make decisions about their care."

This condition has been reported to affect 5 to 10% of the population. Usually, people with subclinical hypothyroidism do not have symptoms given that the level of thyroid hormone is mildly insufficient. However, since thyroid hormone regulates a number of metabolic functions in the body, including cholesterol levels and blood pressure, there is concern regarding whether subclinical hypothyroidism may play a role in increasing the risk of developing heart disease.
This study will focus on assessing whether treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism decreases the risk of having heart disease. This study will be conducted using a database, called the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) from the United Kingdom (UK), which has clinical information on patients that are followed by general practitioners in the UK. These will include age, sex, history of medical conditions, medications and laboratory test results. The CPRD will be used to identify patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and assess those who received levothyroxine treatment, which is the standard treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism. Patients with subclinical hypothyroidism treated with levothyroxine will be compared to patients who were not given treatment and will be followed until the end of the study, a diagnosis of heart disease or death.

People who suffer from dementia have higher risks of complications and death and a significant decrease in their quality of life. The mechanism by which type 2 diabetes leads to cognitive decline is not completely understood but one of the mechanisms found to affect cognitive function in people with type 2 diabetes is related to vascular (blood vessel) injury in the brain. 
Sodium glucose co-transporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitors are the newest agents available to treat type 2 diabetes. This class of antidiabetic agents works by eliminating glucose in the urine, which not only lowers blood glucose levels but was also shown to induce weight loss, lower blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Randomized clinical trials also found that SGLT-2 inhibitor use decreases cardiovascular disease risk, suggesting that these agents provide vascular benefits to people with type 2 diabetes.
Given that people with type 2 diabetes develop cognitive decline from increasing vascular injury from hyperglycemia, the use of SGLT-2 inhibitors may provide a decreased risk of developing cognitive decline and dementia from its protective vascular activity. The aim of our study will be to assess whether people with type 2 diabetes treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors have a lower risk of developing dementia using a large database from the United Kingdom.  The findings of our study will inform the clinical community on whether SGLT-2 inhibitor use decreases the risk of dementia and will justify the need for randomized clinical trials to assess whether SGLT-2 inhibitor use decreases cognitive decline."

Treatment of osteoporosis include adequate calcium and vitamin D intake and some weight bearing exercise. In addition to these interventions, a number of medications have been developed to treat osteoporosis and reduce the risk of fractures. A commonly used medication in osteoporosis management is denosumab which has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of vertebral, non-vertebral and hip fractures. 
Although denosumab is an effective treatment for osteoporosis, there have been recent reports of denosumab causing atypical femoral fractures (AFF) which differ from typical fractures whereby they have delayed healing and have a higher risk of non-union (i.e. failure to heal properly). To further address this concern, our study's objective will be to determine whether individuals with osteoporosis, treated with denosumab have a higher risk of AFF. This study will be conducted using a large database from the United Kingdom called Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD), which has clinical information on patients followed by general practitioners. We will use the CPRD to identify people with osteoporosis treated with denosumab and conduct statistical analyses to assess the risk of AFF associated with denosumab use. 
The findings from our study will inform patients and the clinical community on whether denosumab increases the risk of AFF, which can lead to development of strategies to improve the treatment of osteoporosis with an aim of AFF risk reduction. Furthermore, our study findings will allow clinicians to better inform their patients on the risk of AFF and to recognize the prodromal symptoms of AFF after initiating denosumab. If our study findings do not show an increased risk of AFF associated with denosumab use, this will provide reassurance to patients and clinicians."

Many people with MS recall subtle symptoms before the start of typical MS symptoms. These earliest signs of MS are called prodromal symptoms. Much of the research on prodromal symptoms has focused on people who developed MS in adulthood. Recently, researchers have found that adults with MS were more likely to seek health care (i.e. visit a physician, have a hospitalization and fill out prescriptions) for certain conditions (e.g. fatigue and pain) in the 5 years before their first typical MS symptom. However, there are many questions that are still unanswered. During my PhD I will determine (i) what the most common groups of prodromal symptoms among adults with MS are and (ii) whether men and women with MS experience different prodromal symptoms. Five to ten percent of people with MS develop the condition in childhood. Less is known about prodromal symptoms among children with MS. During my PhD I will determine (i) whether children with MS are more likely to seek healthcare for certain conditions in the years before their first typical MS symptom and (ii) whether children with MS are more likely to have lower education scores before their first typical MS symptom. These findings will be important as they may help doctors diagnose MS earlier, allowing people with MS to start MS therapies more promptly. Moreover, once researchers have a better understanding of how far back in time people with MS can experience symptoms, they will be able to investigate the causes of MS better. Lastly, in the future, new therapies will likely be developed that protect the brain and spinal cord. People with prodromal symptoms can then be identified and prescribed these protective therapies."
"Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) Program: causes, consequences, and impact of health systems for CVD and other NCDs","['Yusuf, Salim']",['N/A'],"['Cardiovascular Diseases', 'Environment And Health', 'Epidemiology', 'Global Health', 'Health Systems', 'Non-Communicable Diseases', 'Population Health', 'Risk Factors']",9793098.0,312568,"Theoverarching focusof the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE)programis to 1) understand why cardiovascular disease (CVD) and other non-communicable disease (NCDs: diabetes, cancers, kidney and lung diseases) incidence and mortality vary substantially betweenpeoplein different countries, communities, with different ethnic and social backgrounds ; 2) understand how theenvironmentinfluences health behaviours, risk factors, CVD and NCDs (the ""causes of the causes""); and 3) to relate variations inhealth systemsin 26 countries and 800 communities on prevention, treatments, incidence and mortality from CVD and NCDs. Bycombining information across these 3 levels of influences, from 5 continents, on multiple diseases and using several complementary lines of investigation(clinical medicine, epidemiology, environmental geography, chemistry, lab medicine, genetics, metabolomics, health systems, policy and statistics),PURE will provide an unprecedented degree of understanding into the causes and consequences of variations in CVD and other NCDs across several populations. PURE will also form aplatformto understand how certain processes (multi-system dys-regulation, frailty, and social vulnerability; correlated with biochemical and genetic changes, e.g. telomere shortening or mosaicism) ofagingare influenced by health behaviours, risk factors and the environment, and how they vary between societies and cultures.We will follow 270,000 individuals from 800 communities in 26 countries for a mean of ten years. We will examine howindividual level exposures and risk factors(health behaviours, risk factors, analyses of stored bloods and urine and physical measures such as adiposity, lung function, strength and BP) are influenced by thecommunityenvironment(tobacco, food, built, air quality and socioeconomic environments); and how the two together affect NCDs. By collecting new information onhealth systems, we will relate it to contrasting patterns of CVD and other NCDs, and try to explain some paradoxical observations (e.g. higher CVD risk factors, but lower CVD events and mortality in high income countries but the reverse in low income countries) and develop an integrated model of different levels of determinants that influence health. Althoughourfocusis in the CIHR priority area ofglobal health and CVD, PURE will generate information on several NCDs that isrelevant to the multi-ethnic population of Canada.The greater range of exposures (individual risk factors, behaviours and environment) that can only be obtained from a study involving different countries, will enablebetter characterization of what is “normal” versus “abnormal” for individuals and for communities, across several countries, including inCanada.Ourtrans-disciplinaryglobal teamof experts and consultants and theunique design of PURE, will enable answering several important questions reliably. We combine this with asuccessful and integrated mentorship and training programthat is both local (within institutions) and international (across institutions) and is expected to develop the careers of >100 trainees and emerging faculty.PURE has already impacted international guidelines, policy and recommendations. It is expected that future discoveries will enable more precise measurement of the Global burden of Disease and influence prevention and treatment of CVD and other NCDs, and related health policy in Canada and globally."

Longitudinal trends in free sugar content of beverages in the Canadian retail food supply: Evaluation of current and projected impacts of novel policies to reduce free sugar consumption,"['Zaltz, Daniel']",['N/A'],"['Dietary Adequacy', 'Dietary Intake', 'Nutrition Policy', 'Nutrition Surveillance']",135000.0,471940,"Free sugars are those extracted from their natural source. Excess consumption of free sugars is associated with poor health outcomes. More than half of all Canadians consume more free sugar than is recommended by the World Health Organization, and sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) are the leading source of these free sugars. SSBs are beverages than contain free sugars, excluding unflavoured milk and 100% juice. There is consistent evidence that policies designed to reduce SSB consumption positively impact population-level consumption and health. In December 2022, ingredient labels and nutrition facts tables on most foods and beverages in the Canadian retail market will change to make free sugar content more easily assessed by the consumer, and to establish a recommended daily amount to be consumed. In 2026, these products will contain warning labels if they contain excess amount of sugar. This study will evaluate (1) if and how the industry responds to new labelling laws by reformulating SSBs to contain less sugar, which has occurred in other countries, and (2) predict the change in free sugar consumption in response to the labelling laws of 2022 and 2026, along with the theoretical addition of a SSB tax. The study will specifically assess how this suite of public health nutrition interventions may have a differential impact on Canadians of different socioeconomic status."

In our previous research, we interviewed infertile couples to ask them about what would help them cope with fertility treatment. We also asked fertility clinic staff (doctors, nurses, and administrative personnel) about their suggestions for helping patients to cope. Couples and staff agreed that patients needed to be better educated about their treatment options,and also needed more emotional support. Couples wanted information about the process of treatment, and to talk to other infertility patients who had been through similar experiences. We plan to survey male and female patients from varied social and cultural backgrounds, as well as health care providers working in fertility clinics, to learn more about the types of information they would like, as well as their preferred ways to obtain informational and emotional support. In order to meet patients' informational and emotional support needs, we will develop a mobile health (mHealth) application (app) that provides information about infertility and its treatment. The app will contain medical information about reproduction and infertility, as well as information about the emotional reactions and relationship issues that can arise during treatment.This smartphone application about infertility will give patients 24-hour access to a trustworthy and comprehensive source of information about infertility.

In the past 30 years, there have been many advances in medical treatment of infertility including different methods of assisted reproductive technologies (ART). As the ability to treat infertility has improved, there has also been a greater awareness of the emotional consequences of infertility. On an individual level, there can be feelings of anger, frustration, anxiety, and depression. In fact, the stress associated with infertility and its treatment may affect not only the success of ART, but also the patients' willingness to continue with treatment. To date, there has been very limited research evaluating the ways in which the couple relationship is affected by infertility, or how the couple's social, cultural, and religious background has an impact on decisions regarding ART. 
Our multidisciplinary team proposes to interview couples using ART services, to learn more about the social and cultural factors that might contribute to their experience of psychological distress and to the progress of their infertility treatment. We will also examine popular literature on ART, in order to have a better understanding of the societal attitudes towards infertility and its treatment."

In response to the devastating impacts of the pandemic on families, 26 community organizations came together, as the Peel Family Support Network (PFSN), to provide collective resources and support. Our research team is currently leading a community needs assessment alongside the PFSN to understand the nature and impacts of COVID-19 restrictions on children, youth, and families in Peel and to identify resources and services required to support and sustain health and well-being during pandemic recovery. Based on responses from over 1,860 caregivers and youth, engaging in physical activity has been identified as a priority area for adolescents (aged 12-18) and caregivers of adolescents. To meet the needs of Peel's diverse communities, this project engages a Community Advisory Board of adolescents, caregivers, service providers, and researchers to guide all project activities. Photo-based methods, a community prioritization activity, and a ""hackathon-style"" event, will be used to explore the physical activity experiences of adolescents and their caregivers throughout the pandemic and co-create physical activity interventions to move knowledge to action to promote and sustain physical activity during pandemic recovery. As many communities lack adequate resources for physical activity, COVID-19 recovery presents an opportunity for collective innovation, where adolescents and caregivers can co-create meaningful and accessible physical activity interventions with service providers. By conducting this work in partnership with the PFSN and community members, we expect these physical activity interventions can be adapted for use with other age groups, will be relevant to diverse communities across different geographical settings, and can be tested and evaluated in other regions of Ontario and Canada."

Previous research with racialized and diverse communities shows the need for multilevel approaches that consider individual, family, community, and systemic factors. The Peel region, Ontario, in which our project is based, has seen some of the highest rates of COVID-19 infections in Canada and is an ideal setting for understanding how racialized and diverse communities have experienced family violence throughout the pandemic. Building from the region's Community Safety and Well-being plan, we will engage a diverse group of community members who have experienced family violence, service providers, and researchers to guide all project activities. Through photo-narrative methods, a community prioritization activity, and a hackathon-style event, we will explore experiences of family violence and co-create preventative interventions during pandemic recovery that are evidence-informed and culturally sensitive to help racialized and diverse families at-risk of experiencing family violence in Peel.

These adolescents voiced the need to develop awareness-raising products that could share their negative experiences of DRS, dispel myths, and educate their teachers and peers to combat DRS in high schools. Our project uses participatory research methods to mobilize and integrate the lived experience of adolescents with T1D with existing evidence to co-design multi-media awareness products to address DRS in high schools. The project has four main phases. Phase 1: We will engage adolescents with T1D, healthcare providers, educators, diabetes advocacy groups and community partners through a Community Advisory Board and hire and train high school adolescents with T1D as Peer Researchers to support all project activities. Phase 2: We will conduct a scoping review to identify existing evidence and characterize gaps, priority topics, and recommendations for types of content (messages, stories, testimonials, etc.) to inform the development of the DRS awareness products. Phase 3: High school adolescents with T1D will co-design multimedia DRS awareness products using digital storytelling that can be used in high schools. Phase 4: We will assemble the final multimedia awareness products and develop an associated knowledge mobilization plan to enhance uptake in diverse school settings locally and beyond. At a time when educational systems are working with cross-sector partners to address hate and discrimination in schools, this project will mobilize knowledge into practice and center lived experience to combat DRS in high schools and reduce the harm to high school students with T1D."

When cancer patients and their families receive the devastating news of a terminal cancer diagnosis, they reasonably exhaust all possible treatment options in search of extending life or a cure. However, the options they identify may not be evidence-based medical options but exploitative purveyors of false hope. Predatory alternative cancer clinics rely upon online technology platforms to attract patients and shape their online reputations. Therefore, the extent and drivers facilitating incurable illness exploitation online are understudied and require urgent public health attention. This project seeks to develop a harmful online ecosystem conceptual framework to document and understand the synergistic impacts of technology platforms and how they exploit terminally ill cancer patients. I will use an interpretivist qualitative analysis approach to understand how technology platforms attract and mislead potential patients. My research will use several theories, including critical discourse theory, grounded theory, and policy analytic framing. The findings will be interpreted with special attention to the commercial determinants of health. To complete this research, I plan to complete six individual projects over two years. Specific data to be collected and analyzed from alternative cancer clinics includes: 1) sponsored Google search results; 2) YouTube ads; 3) Facebook and Instagram posts; 4) TikTok videos and comments; 5) Amazon products listing for cancer cures; and 6) crowdfunding campaigns for alternative treatment. My proposed research will help understand the harmful online environment created or enabled by online technology platforms and how their vested interests may be incompatible with preventing the exploitation of cancer patients."
Analytic methods to identify important relationships between environmental exposures and health outcomes using epidemiologic and other large-scale observational data,"['Zeraatkar, Dena']",['N/A'],"['Epidemiology', 'Meta-Science', 'Statistics']",140000.0,411607,"Randomized controlled trials represent the optimal design for investigating the health effects of medical interventions. They often pose significant challenges, however, for answering questions related to the health effects of nutritional and environmental exposures. Epidemiological studies can provide important information on the effects of exposures when randomized controlled trials are not practical. Such studies recruit tens of thousands of participants and collect information on a wide panel of exposures and health outcomes, typically by questionnaires, biomarkers, and linkage to disease registries and medical records. Current practices in epidemiology, however, have been criticized for producing a non-reproducible and misleading body of evidence, which limits scientific understanding of the determinants of health and disease, reduces our ability to make informed clinical and policy decisions, and potentially undermines the public's trust in research. The proposed program of research will develop novel analytic methods to address major issues that have limited epidemiology from yielding actionable insight on the causes of disease. The application of these methods has the potential to substantially improve the methodological rigor of epidemiology, accelerate our understanding of the environmental causes of disease, and increase the value of existing and future large-scale epidemiologic data sources for research."

Although healthcare surrounding this fatal chronic disease has been improving, it still remains very problematic in many under-privileged communities, especially in Canada's Inuit population. In Nunavik, the northern third part of the province of Quebec, lung cancer incidence has been recorded to be the highest in the province. The majority of the population in Nunavik is Inuit. We still don't know much on the demographics and cancer outcomes of the patients in this region. In this first step of our project, we would like to explore the demographics, lung cancer subtypes, stages at diagnosis, and survival rates of these patients. We want to compare them with their non-Inuit counterparts, in Montreal, to see whether there is a difference in survival after diagnosis. We would also like to see whether these patients' characteristics differ between the two coasts within Nunavik (the Hudson coast and the Ungava coast). 
To do so, we included every adult patients newly diagnosed with primary lung cancer, between January 1st, 2005 and December 31st, 2016. They either resided in Nunavik or in Montreal. We used different statistical tests to evaluate the differences we observed. We noted an unequal gender distribution of lung cancer patients between the two coasts, with more female patients in the Ungava sub-region and more male patients in the Hudson sub-region. Moreover, we observed that the patients from Nunavik were generally younger than those from Montreal in terms of their age at diagnosis. The Nunavik patients also had different subtypes of lung cancer and possibly an higher all-cause mortality. More research is still being done to further explore and analyse these differences, and to identify any potential factors that may be contributing to these differences."

However, if a health condition progresses or worsens, people may attend at work but cannot perform at full capacity (i.e., presenteeism), take sick leaves, or have to reduce routine work hours or even completely stop working. When people are older, they are more likely to suffer from one or more health conditions. Thus, work productivity loss due to health problems may be more substantial among middle-aged or older adults. People with health problems may start with low presenteeism, gradually increase presenteeism and then stop working especially if they are not well supported by workplaces and governments. However, few studies have examined how work productivity loss is changing over time and how presenteeism leads to future unemployment or retirement especially among an aging population. Meanwhile, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the transition to working from home (WFH), it is also important to consider the impact of COVID-19 and WFH on presenteeism. Based on the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging data, this study is to address the knowledge gaps and includes four specific objectives: 1) to examine how employment status changes over time among middle-aged or older workers and what factors are associated with the changes; 2) to measure how current presenteeism relates to employment status in the short-medium term within the context of COVID-19; 3) to measure how presenteeism changes over time among those who remain employed and examine the relationship between WFH during COVID-19 and this change; 4) to examine any sex and gender differences. The study will provide evidence to inform workplace and government supports to help maintain the work productivity of middle-aged or older workers and retain them in the workforce, and to inform whether WFH is an option for such a purpose."

The Social Impact of Cervical Cancer on Women and their Children in Uganda,"['Zhou, Chuanlin']",['N/A'],['Ics Travel Awards'],1500.0,495276,"Cervical cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death among Ugandan women, despite being a preventable disease. Women in Uganda also often play a crucial role in taking care of children at home.  Therefore, being diagnosed with cervical cancer has several consequences for women's children as well. The goal of this study is to describe the social impacts of a woman's cervical cancer treatment on herself and her children. 
Participants were interviewed as part of a larger study: ASPIRE Generations. Women were eligible if they: were 18 years of age or older, were being treated for cervical cancer at the Uganda Cancer Institute (UCI), speak English, Luganda, Lusoga, Luo, or Runyankore, and provided informed consent. Overall, 24 interviews were conducted. Participants were an average of 49.5 years old, had between 0 to 6 children, and the majority had a primary school level of education or less. Many women reported that since being diagnosed, their relationships with their partner and friends worsened. Some women reported that they hid their cervical cancer diagnosis because they were afraid of being stigmatized. Women also spoke about reducing their work and the resulting loss of income which created financial challenges for them and their caretakers. Reduced household income caused some children to be withdrawn from school due to a lack of funds for tuition. Women also reported changes to roles in the household, with children often taking on additional responsibilities such as caregiving and finding employment to support the family. 

This research can help better understand the widespread effects of cervical cancer in Uganda and similar countries. The results can help inform policies and practices related to cervical cancer prevention and treatment that are appropriate for Ugandan women and their families. This evidence will help advocate for increased resources for cervical cancer screening programs, both in Uganda and globally."

Researchers worldwide have used these data sources in the last decade to detect patterns in the population that would help with infectious diseases such as Malaria, Cholera, Rubella, HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) etc. The COVID-19 pandemic saw the use of these data sources by public health organizations across the globe, in the face of a virus that was spreading rapidly within the population. Use of this data has been linked to predict the virus' spread and the extent to which public health measures were followed by citizens. Public Health Agency of Canada recently admitted to using mobility data to track population movement during lockdown. While this is providing exciting new frontiers for future research projects using real-time big data sources, this has also brought up concerns for the ethical implications of using non-consensual data in research. Discussions regarding these concerns have been initiated between individuals in government and research communities. However, most of the general public are still unfamiliar with the existence and use of mobility data. As such, the purpose of this Café is to bring this conversation to the residents of Kingston, Ontario. This Café is an invitation and education session to inform the community on what ""mobility data"" means, and what the implications are for using such data for research, and for the community members to voice their perceptions and concerns with this data use."

Since the early 1990s, China is the largest source of immigrants to Canada. Through the internet, Chinese mass media, and frequent travel ""home"", these recent immigrants commonly live in what are increasingly recognized as ""transnational spaces"", ones where the territorial borders of Canada and China are reduced in importance when it comes to sexual health. It appears that, unlike in earlier generations, China continues to play an important role in the lives of recent immigrants, affecting their health risk (including risk for HIV). Aiming to understand the specific vulnerability to HIV faced by the current generation of Chinese immigrants in a transnational context, the study has three main objectives: a) to understand how such ""transnational spaces"" have had differential impacts on Chinese immigrant men and women's exposure to HIV risk and their capacity to respond to such risk; b) to compare the ways in which HIV/AIDS related responses (such as knowledge construction, education, service delivery, involvement of civil society organizations [CSOs] and policy-making) have taken account of these gender-based differences in Canada and China; and c) to explore the implications of transnationalism and globalization on HIV interventions, as well as on inequalities, including gendered ones, in health outcomes and services. The data will be collected through qualitative interviews with Chinese immigrants, CSO workers, service providers and governmental officials in the two countries. The findings will help develop more responsive education programs, services and policies that take account of the transnational spaces and lay a foundation for strengthening future global health collaborations and governance."
War and Biological Ageing in Vietnam: A Planning Grant to Foster Collaboration on a Novel Area of Global Research in Health and Ageing,"['Zimmer, Zachary', 'Korinek, Kim', 'Teerawichitchainan, Bussarawan']",['N/A'],"['Asia', 'Biological Ageing', 'Conflict', 'Lower And Middle Income Countries', 'Methylation', 'Trauma', 'Vietnam', 'War']",19990.0,404425,"This proposal requests funds to support activities that facilitate the exchange of ideas about a novel area of ageing and health research: how exposure to war and related traumatic wartime events, in a developing country setting, influences biological ageing. Activities will be followed up by the development and submission of a related CIHR Project Grant. The main activity supported by the grant is a workshop to take place at Mount Saint Vincent University in Halifax, Nova Scotia in July, 2019. Participants will develop a strategy for a sustained program of research. Following the workshop, participants will develop a collaborative CIHR Project Grant to be submitted for funding consideration. The Project Grant will examine blood samples collected from about 2800 Vietnamese who were differentially involved in the American Vietnam War and are now moving into older ages where signs and symptoms of chronic disease are typical and onset of health deterioration often begins. These blood samples will be linked to a survey that includes extensive data on wartime exposure. The blood will be tested for outcomes such as biological ageing through DNA methylation. Understanding and then analyzing results from these tests for the purpose of identifying long-term biological impacts of war requires a diverse and interdisciplinary academic team with a range of expertise. Further, it requires individuals with a deep appreciation of the social context of Vietnam. Moreover, putting the results to best use, or translating knowledge from this type of project into practice, requires input and engagement from local investigators, in this case being the Vietnamese academic community. This workshop puts together such a team for the purpose of long-term collaboration."

Most live in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where health infrastructure is underdeveloped and living conditions are often substandard. The numbers that endured conflict in these parts of the world are increasing. Despite this, systematic knowledge about how traumatic war experiences affect health and aging in LMICs is inadequate. Given the numbers, this knowledge is essential for advancing global population health. Our study analyzes data from a sample of about 2,500 in late-middle and early-old age differentially exposed to conflict during wars in Vietnam (1955-1975). Many were directly engaged in battle; others had family members engaged; and many lived in or near communities targeted by bombing. Linking blood samples to comprehensive survey responses, a global multidisciplinary team, that bridges social, medical and biological sciences, will analyze how exposure to war associates with long-term health by connecting wartime exposure with rates of biological aging. Outcomes are based on integrative indicators of aging including allostatic load, dysregulation, metabolic syndrome and inflammaging. We also integrate contemporary measures of epigenetic aging using methylation. Further, qualitative data collection is used to develop a deeper understanding of the mechanisms linking exposure to health. We test hypotheses about how war exposure and biological aging are connected and the degree to which current stressors and social support modify these trajectories. Associations are compared across men and women considering effects of biological sex and socially constructed gender. The Vietnamese people were exposed to one of history's most brutal wars. They live in a country challenged by population aging and under- diagnosed, noncommunicable chronic diseases. These factors present a time- sensitive and unique opportunity to learn much about how war impacts on the long-term health of populations."

Little is known about the reasons for vaccine hesitancy in these communities. Preliminary findings from our scoping review reveal lack of easy access to vaccines, poverty, a mistrust of public institutions, racism, and mis/disinformation as major causes. As a result, the goal of this planning and dissemination project is to build equitable and empowering partnerships to address vaccine hesitancy in ethno-racial communities in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). We aim to bring together community leaders, service providers, and key informants from Asian, Black, Middle Eastern, Latinx, and North African (MENA) communities to: (i) share the results of a recent literature review on vaccine hesitancy in the above communities; (ii) engage community stakeholders in discussing the reasons for vaccine hesitancy in the their communities; (iii) work with these community stakeholders on good public health messaging around vaccine hesitancy and misinformation; and (iv) develop a community-based CIHR grant proposal team that works toward a grassroots public health communication plan for use during public health crises."

In a context of sustainable healthy cities promoted the sustainable development goals, environmentally friendly approaches to Aedes control are needed to attain permanent reductions in mosquito populations which are increasingly supported by Ministries of Health in endemic countries. 

The principal research question is to determine if an EcoHealth intervention based upon community mobilization reduces the risk of dengue virus infection among 3 to 9 years olds compared to usual dengue control practice in Fortaleza, Brazil.

The present study will follow a pragmatic cluster RCT design with randomization at the census tract level with equal allocation to the two arms. There will be 34 clusters in each arm of 80 children aged between 3 to 9 years old for a total of 5,440 children enrolled in the study. Household visits will occur every six months for a total of six visits over a 3-year period to cover both dry and rainy seasons. At allocation, adaptable locally-made covers for water containers will be installed in all households from the intervention clusters. Following water cover installation, community mobilization activities will begin and locally customized activities will be implemented. 

Primary outcomes are rates of anti-dengue Immunoglobin G (IgG) seroconversion to evaluate the incidence of primary infections, levels of salivary biomarkers of Aedes exposure to evaluate the exposure to Aedes bites, and the number of pupae per 100 households examined to evaluate Aedes presence and density. The results will help develop evidence-based vector control programs in Brazil, and also in other countries struggling with Aedes-transmitted diseases. Importantly, this study will also provide estimates on dengue burden based upon a representative population sample, which is currently lacking in Brazil as they rely on passive surveillance."

My research program, which is currently being developed, includes three major themes:
1) Understanding the characteristics and drivers of disease emergence and spread of infectious diseases, including Zika, malaria, and dengue fever.
2) Evaluating the effectiveness of public health interventions in low and middle income populations, such as long-lasting insecticide treated nets on the malaria burden in Uganda.
3) Examining water and food security implications of climate change in vulnerable populations.

The overall aim of this study is to use a multi-disease perspective to identify disease patterns, drivers, and accurate disease forecasting methods that allow clinical and public health services to proactively plan and implement control and prevention measures.

Disease, sociodemographic, and environmental data will be used in this study, which will be available at the national and municipal level in Colombia. We will begin by exploring the individual and joint disease dependencies by quantifying the correlation and variation of reported cases over time and space with Poisson-lognormal mixture models. The Bayesian multivariate models will be extended to forecast weekly disease burdens for a period of one year. Machine learning algorithms such as support vector machine regressions and random forest regressions will be developed to forecast disease burden. Semi-mechanistic dynamic models will also be developed for burden forecasts and these models will capture disease transmission processes. All forecasting results will be compared using various metrics of evaluation.

The findings have the potential to greatly add to our understanding of the epidemiological profiles of chikungunya, dengue, and Zika, which is necessary for their successful control. The identification of at-risk areas and time periods can be used to inform targeted, integrated Aedes control programs and education campaigns. The forecasts, if accurate, will provide clinical and public health systems in Colombia with the necessary lead time for informed, proactive decisions."

This project aims to understand the determinants of vaccine hesitancy among parents and adolescents in Montreal and to develop strategies to address inequalities in vaccine acceptance. For this project, we will extend a current cohort study (Enfants et COVID-19: Étude de seroprevalence, EnCORE) which includes two of Montréal's most disadvantaged neighbourhoods. Our objectives are to monitor vaccine hesitancy and uptake in parents and teens through online questionnaires and also to engage with community members to better understand attitudes and perceptions of COVID-19 vaccination. For community engagement, we will create teams of parents and youth that will actively guide the research process with the goal of designing innovative solutions to address vaccine hesitancy in their communities.

Studying if community mobilization results in sustainable change and for whom, will improve our understanding of the intervention processes and the potential success of the intervention in other contexts and thus enhancing the transferability of results and approach. 

Our proposed study is a series of implementation science evaluations in eight of the intervention communities assessing the implementation process, fidelity, and social acceptability of the intervention (Objective 1). We will also examine if and how the intervention empowers communities and if this can be sustained over time (Objective 2). Finally, we will identify the interactions between the context, the mechanism, and the effect of the intervention through conducting a realist evaluation. The data collection for all three objectives will be a mix of documents, field observations, and interviews with key community stakeholders. For Objectives 1 & 2, a deductive-inductive approach will be used for the analysis of each of the domains of interest.

We will continue following EnCORE study participants (n=2,061) for two additional rounds of data collection. The data collection will involve an online questionnaire followed by in-home finger prick blood collection. The blood samples will be analyzed in a laboratory for natural and vaccine-induced immunoglobin G (IgG). Also, we will randomly select 90 participants from 5 to 11 years of age for venous blood draws to further explore cell-mediated immunity (e.g., total antibody levels, neutralization, and T-cell testing). Multivariable statistical analyses will be conducted to estimate the number of children with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, vaccine coverage, and magnitude of antibody response.

This work will positively contribute to existing COVID-19 research gaps. The seroprevalence estimates will provide a better understanding of the disease dynamics, to identify hotspots and at-risk groups for targeted interventions, until high coverage of COVID-19 vaccination is obtained in children and in teenagers. Furthermore, having a better understanding of cell-medicated immunity and the potential role of prior immunity to human common coronaviruses, will be a valuable contribution to COVID-19 immunology, understanding of vaccine responses, need for booster shots, number of doses needed in children, and potentially an explanation of why children are less likely to be seriously sick with COVID-19."
